=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 17:22:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 17:44:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```python
def find_shapes(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, background: int, opposite_frame: int, eight_cells: set = None) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    shapes = []
    visited = [[False] * 22 for _ in range(22)]
    for i in range(22):
        for j in range(22):
            if g[i][j] == frame_color and not visited[i][j] and (eight_cells is None or (i, j) not in eight_cells):
                frame_cells = []
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                frame_cells.append((i, j))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == frame_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            frame_cells.append((nx, ny))
                inner_cells = set()
                for x, y in frame_cells:
                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                                continue
                            nx = x + dx
                            ny = y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and (nx, ny) not in inner_cells and g[nx][ny] != background and g[nx][ny] != opposite_frame and g[nx][ny] != frame_color:
                                inner_cells.add((nx, ny))
                all_cells = frame_cells + list(inner_cells)
                if all_cells:
                    minr = min(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    maxr = max(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    minc = min(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    maxc = max(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    shapes.append({'minr': minr, 'maxr': maxr, 'minc': minc, 'maxc': maxc})
    return shapes
```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

```python
def place_left_shapes(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], background: int, shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]):
    current_left_width = 0
    last_maxr_left = -1
    for sh in shapes:
        minr = sh['minr']
        maxr = sh['maxr']
        minc = sh['minc']
        maxc = sh['maxc']
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        if minr > last_maxr_left + 1:
            proposed_left = 0
        else:
            proposed_left = current_left_width
        # place (assume no conflict)
        for rr in range(minr, maxr + 1):
            for kk in range(w):
                oc = proposed_left + kk
                if oc < 22:
                    nv = g[rr][minc + kk]
                    if nv != background:
                        out[rr][oc] = nv
        current_left_width = max(current_left_width, proposed_left + w)
        last_maxr_left = maxr
```
(This handles left stacking with vertical block detection; works for non-overlapping left placements but assumes no conflicts—fine for 8-shapes as they go first.)

```python
def place_right_shapes(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], background: int, shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]):
    current_start_col = 22
    current_right_width = 0
    last_maxr_right = -1
    block_min_row = 22
    block_max_row = -1
    for sh in shapes:
        minr = sh['minr']
        maxr = sh['maxr']
        minc = sh['minc']
        maxc = sh['maxc']
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        is_new = minr > last_maxr_right
        old_start_col = current_start_col
        if is_new:
            proposed_start_col = 22 - w
            place_start_col = proposed_start_col
            current_start_col = proposed_start_col
            current_right_width = w
            block_min_row = minr
            block_max_row = maxr
        else:

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 17:44:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key

[2025-10-02 17:57:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of colored integers representing shapes made of connected blocks, where the goal is to separate and rearrange "bordered" shapes (those containing the color 8, likely frames or outlines) onto the left side of a new output grid and "open" shapes (lacking 8) onto the right side, while handling background colors appropriately. The output preserves some structural aspects of the shapes but repositions them in a specific layout that combines elements from the original grid, rather than simple extraction and stacking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid, but it varies (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 8 across examples), and non-background components must be identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS on 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right) excluding background.
 * Shapes are connected components of non-background cells; single cells or small groups count as components if non-bg.
 * Classification: Bordered ('left') shapes contain at least one 8 (often as a frame around inner colors like 5,3,4); open ('right') shapes lack 8 entirely (e.g., solid blocks of 1,3,5,6,9).
 * Sorting: Components should be ordered by their topmost row (min row index) to maintain vertical sequence from the original grid.
 * Placement is not simple vertical stacking from row 0; instead, left-side shapes retain some original positional structure (e.g., bordered frames with inner shapes placed relative to their original rows, sometimes with extensions or merges), while right-side shapes are extracted and placed starting around column 17 but aligned to specific rows (not stacked contiguously—gaps or offsets occur based on original positions). Output grid is always 22x22, padded with background where needed.
 * Subtle elements: Bordered shapes on left often include the 8 frame intact, creating enclosed areas (e.g., 8 around 5's or 3's), and may overlap or extend horizontally into middle columns in the output; right shapes are "unframed" versions placed without borders, sometimes horizontally adjacent in the right panel. Gaps between shapes must match original relative spacing (not filled or stacked tightly). Background propagation: Left may use original bg or 8, right uses a consistent bg (often 0 or 2). Easy to miss: Some shapes span multiple rows/columns irregularly (not always rectangular), and output may include "divider" areas (e.g., columns 5-16 often bg or transitional). Components must ignore diagonal connections—only orthogonal. In some cases, large bg areas or full-row shapes (e.g., bottom bars of 4's) need special handling to avoid misplacement.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; shapes keep original colors. Output rows may have asymmetric lengths in description but are full 22 cols. Test input has complex nested shapes (e.g., 7 inside 8's on left, 9's as bg? on right), requiring careful component bounding without breaking frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS stack for flood-fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS stack for flood-fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```python
def find_shapes(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, background: int, opposite_frame: int, eight_cells: set = None) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:

    for i in range(22):
        for j in range(22):

                q = deque([(i, j)])

                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:

(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 18:03:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the most frequent color.)

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import deque

def get_bounding(all_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rows = [r for r, c in all_cells]
    cols = [c for r, c in all_cells]
    return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(Useful for computing bounding boxes of extracted shapes.)

```python
def find_connected_frames(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, bg: int, excluded: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = None) -> Tuple[List[Dict[str, int]], Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:

    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    shapes: List[Dict[str, int]] = []
    all_used_cells: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] == frame_color and not visited[i][j] and (excluded is None or (i, j) not in excluded):
                frame_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                frame_cells.append((i, j))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == frame_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            frame_cells.append((nx, ny))
                inner_cells: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
                for x, y in frame_cells:
                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0: continue
                            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in inner_cells and g[nx][ny] != bg and g[nx][ny] != frame_color:
                                inner_cells.add((nx, ny))
                all_cells_list = frame_cells + list(inner_cells)
                if all_cells_list:
                    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = get_bounding(all_cells_list)
                    shapes.append({'minr': min_r, 'maxr': max_r, 'minc': min_c, 'maxc': max_c})
                    for pos in all_cells_list:
                        all_used_cells.add(pos)
    return shapes, all_used_cells
```
(This is core for extracting connected frame components and their adjacent inners, returning bounding boxes and used cells; helpful for separation of left/right.)

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

[2025-10-02 18:03:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of colored integers representing shapes made of connected blocks, where the goal is to separate and rearrange "bordered" shapes (those containing the color 8, likely frames or outlines) onto the left side of a new output grid and "open" shapes (lacking 8) onto the right side, while handling background colors appropriately. The output preserves some structural aspects of the shapes but repositions them in a specific layout that combines elements from the original grid, rather than simple extraction and stacking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid, but it varies (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 8 across examples), and non-background components must be identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS on 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right) excluding background.
 * Shapes are connected components of non-background cells; single cells or small groups count as components if non-bg.
 * Classification: Bordered ('left') shapes contain at least one 8 (often as a frame around inner colors like 5,3,4); open ('right') shapes lack 8 entirely (e.g., solid blocks of 1,3,5,6,9).
 * Sorting: Components should be ordered by their topmost row (min row index) to maintain vertical sequence from the original grid.
 * Placement is not simple vertical stacking from row 0; instead, left-side shapes retain some original positional structure (e.g., bordered frames with inner shapes placed relative to their original rows, sometimes with extensions or merges), while right-side shapes are extracted and placed starting around column 17 but aligned to specific rows (not stacked contiguously—gaps or offsets occur based on original positions). Output grid is always 22x22, padded with background where needed.
 * Subtle elements: Bordered shapes on left often include the 8 frame intact, creating enclosed areas (e.g., 8 around 5's or 3's), and may overlap or extend horizontally into middle columns in the output; right shapes are "unframed" versions placed without borders, sometimes horizontally adjacent in the right panel. Gaps between shapes must match original relative spacing (not filled or stacked tightly). Background propagation: Left may use original bg or 8, right uses a consistent bg (often 0 or 2). Easy to miss: Some shapes span multiple rows/columns irregularly (not always rectangular), and output may include "divider" areas (e.g., columns 5-16 often bg or transitional). Components must ignore diagonal connections—only orthogonal. In some cases, large bg areas or full-row shapes (e.g., bottom bars of 4's) need special handling to avoid misplacement.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; shapes keep original colors. Output rows may have asymmetric lengths in description but are full 22 cols. Test input has complex nested shapes (e.g., 7 inside 8's on left, 9's as bg? on right), requiring careful component bounding without breaking frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS stack for flood-fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```python
def find_shapes(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, background: int, opposite_frame: int, eight_cells: set = None) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:

    for i in range(22):
        for j in range(22):
            if g[i][j] == frame_color and not visited[i][j] and (eight_cells is None or (i, j) not in eight_cells):
                frame_cells = []
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                frame_cells.append((i, j))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()

                        ny = y + dy

(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the most frequent color.)

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import deque

def get_bounding(all_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rows = [r for r, c in all_cells]
    cols = [c for r, c in all_cells]
    return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(Useful for computing bounding boxes of extracted shapes.)

```
(This is core for extracting connected frame components and their adjacent inners, returning bounding boxes and used cells; helpful for separation of left/right.)

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 18:27:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

[2025-10-02 18:27:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of colored integers representing shapes made of connected blocks, where the goal is to separate and rearrange "bordered" shapes (those containing the color 8, likely frames or outlines) onto the left side of a new output grid and "open" shapes (lacking 8) onto the right side, while handling background colors appropriately. The output preserves some structural aspects of the shapes but repositions them in a specific layout that combines elements from the original grid, rather than simple extraction and stacking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid, but it varies (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 8 across examples), and non-background components must be identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS on 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right) excluding background.
 * Shapes are connected components of non-background cells; single cells or small groups count as components if non-bg.
 * Classification: Bordered ('left') shapes contain at least one 8 (often as a frame around inner colors like 5,3,4); open ('right') shapes lack 8 entirely (e.g., solid blocks of 1,3,5,6,9).
 * Sorting: Components should be ordered by their topmost row (min row index) to maintain vertical sequence from the original grid.
 * Placement is not simple vertical stacking from row 0; instead, left-side shapes retain some original positional structure (e.g., bordered frames with inner shapes placed relative to their original rows, sometimes with extensions or merges), while right-side shapes are extracted and placed starting around column 17 but aligned to specific rows (not stacked contiguously—gaps or offsets occur based on original positions). Output grid is always 22x22, padded with background where needed.
 * Subtle elements: Bordered shapes on left often include the 8 frame intact, creating enclosed areas (e.g., 8 around 5's or 3's), and may overlap or extend horizontally into middle columns in the output; right shapes are "unframed" versions placed without borders, sometimes horizontally adjacent in the right panel. Gaps between shapes must match original relative spacing (not filled or stacked tightly). Background propagation: Left may use original bg or 8, right uses a consistent bg (often 0 or 2). Easy to miss: Some shapes span multiple rows/columns irregularly (not always rectangular), and output may include "divider" areas (e.g., columns 5-16 often bg or transitional). Components must ignore diagonal connections—only orthogonal. In some cases, large bg areas or full-row shapes (e.g., bottom bars of 4's) need special handling to avoid misplacement.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; shapes keep original colors. Output rows may have asymmetric lengths in description but are full 22 cols. Test input has complex nested shapes (e.g., 7 inside 8's on left, 9's as bg? on right), requiring careful component bounding without breaking frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS stack for flood-fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```python
def find_shapes(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, background: int, opposite_frame: int, eight_cells: set = None) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    shapes = []
    visited = [[False] * 22 for _ in range(22)]
    for i in range(22):
        for j in range(22):
            if g[i][j] == frame_color and not visited[i][j] and (eight_cells is None or (i, j) not in eight_cells):
                frame_cells = []
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                frame_cells.append((i, j))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == frame_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            frame_cells.append((nx, ny))
                inner_cells = set()
                for x, y in frame_cells:
                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                                continue
                            nx = x + dx
                            ny = y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and (nx, ny) not in inner_cells and g[nx][ny] != background and g[nx][ny] != opposite_frame and g[nx][ny] != frame_color:
                                inner_cells.add((nx, ny))
                all_cells = frame_cells + list(inner_cells)
                if all_cells:
                    minr = min(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    maxr = max(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    minc = min(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    maxc = max(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    shapes.append({'minr': minr, 'maxr': maxr, 'minc': minc, 'maxc': maxc})
    return shapes
```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

```python
def place_left_shapes(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], background: int, shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]):
    current_left_width = 0
    last_maxr_left = -1
    for sh in shapes:
        minr = sh['minr']
        maxr = sh['maxr']
        minc = sh['minc']
        maxc = sh['maxc']
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        if minr > last_maxr_left + 1:
            proposed_left = 0
        else:
            proposed_left = current_left_width
        # place (assume no conflict)
        for rr in range(minr, maxr + 1):
            for kk in range(w):
                oc = proposed_left + kk
                if oc < 22:

        current_left_width = max(current_left_width, proposed_left + w)
        last_maxr_left = maxr
```
(This handles left stacking with vertical block detection; works for non-overlapping left placements but assumes no conflicts—fine for 8-shapes as they go first.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

(This is core for extracting connected frame components and their adjacent inners, returning bounding boxes and used cells; helpful for separation of left/right.)

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 18:50:32] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing various numbered cells (representing colored or shaped blobs) needs to be processed by identifying connected components (non-background blobs), separating them into "left" (those containing the number 8) and "right" (those without 8) groups, vertically grouping contiguous blocks of these components by row ranges, and then reassembling them side-by-side in a new 22x22 grid: left blocks placed flush left (starting at column 0) and right blocks placed flush right (starting at column 22 - total width), while preserving the relative row positions and internal shapes of each component without rotation or scaling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components with any cell equal to 8 are "left" (even if mixed numbers); those without 8 are "right"—this is a binary split, not per-number.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" only if their row ranges overlap or are adjacent (max row of previous +1 >= min row of next); sort blocks by starting row.
 * Within each block, sort components left-to-right by their original min column, then place them contiguously in the output: for left blocks, start at col 0; for right blocks, start at col (22 - sum of widths in block), where width = maxc - minc + 1.
 * When placing, copy exact cell values from original positions, but shift horizontally to the new contiguous position; do not alter rows, and only place if the target column is within 0-21 and the source cell is non-background.
 * Subtlety: Components may overlap in columns within a block, but placement concatenates their widths without merging or overlapping in output—treat as side-by-side abutment.
 * Easy to miss: 8 can appear anywhere in a left component (not just borders); right components never have 8; background cells in output start as bg but are overwritten only by non-bg source cells.
 * Vertical gaps between blocks are preserved (empty rows in output stay bg); no vertical shifting or compression.
 * Input grids are 22x22; output must be exactly 22x22; numbers like 1-9 represent distinct "colors" or shapes to preserve exactly.
 * Potential edge cases: Single-cell components; blocks spanning full height; components with irregular shapes (not rectangles, so use min/max for bounding but copy actual cells); multiple blocks per side; zero-width or empty blocks (skip).
 * No rotation, reflection, or color changes; preserve all non-bg cells' values and positions relatively.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, useful for all examples; e.g., 0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if comp:
                    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
                    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
                    minr, maxr = min(rs), max(rs)
                    minc, maxc = min(cs), max(cs)
                    has8 = any(g[r][c] == 8 for r, c in comp)
                    components.append((minr, maxr, minc, maxc, has8))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes and 8-flag is core and mostly correct; it accurately detects shapes in all examples but needs integration fixes for placement.)

```python
def group_blocks(shapes: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]]:
    blocks = []
    if not shapes:
        return blocks
    # Sort by minr first (missing in provided code; add: shapes = sorted(shapes, key=lambda x: x[0]))
    current_block = [shapes[0]]
    current_maxr = shapes[0][1]
    for s in shapes[1:]:
        minr = s[0]
        if minr > current_maxr + 1:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [s]
            current_maxr = s[1]
        else:
            current_block.append(s)
            current_maxr = max(current_maxr, s[1])
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This vertical grouping logic is helpful but buggy in provided code: assumes pre-sorted input and uses has8 tuple; needs sort by minr and strip has8 for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly identifies background (0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test) and finds components with 8-flag, splitting into left/right— this works for core detection in all cases.
 * Grouping into vertical blocks works partially (e.g., train2 correct overall), but fails when components in a block have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential order, as sorting by minr is missing/incomplete.
 * Placement logic in place_block is broken: sorts by minc but then uses original minc for copying (causing misalignment); computes widths correctly but shifts incorrectly (e.g., uses minc + k for source but current + k for target without full offset); only copies if source non-bg but doesn't handle full shape copy (misses non-rectangular fills).
 * Train1 incorrect: Left blocks (with 8) placed mostly correct but right blocks shifted left too far (e.g., row2: 2's start at col12 in generated vs col17 in expected; row7: extra 2's in cols11-16; row8: 2's and 3's misplaced horizontally); bottom section (rows14-21) has 6/2/4/8 blobs concatenated wrong, with 8's on left but expected has them integrated differently—no vertical gaps preserved properly.
 * Train2 correct: All placements match expected, suggesting the logic works for simpler vertical alignments without overlaps or gaps.
 * Train3 incorrect: Top row has extra 1's and misplaced 2's (generated row0: 1's then 2's vs expected 1's then 2's but shifted); right blocks (no 8) like 3/5/4 placed too leftward (e.g., row1: 3's at col16-18 in generated vs col17-19 expected; row13: 2's at end but extra 2's in row12); left blocks with 8 correct but overall horizontal concatenation fails for multi-component blocks.
 * In all incorrect cases, right-side placement starts too early (not at 22 - total_w), causing overlap or squeeze; left flush is better but still misaligns internals.
 * Function place_block is broken/not helpful as-is: incorrect offset (uses minc in source loop, causing partial copies); doesn't copy full component cells, only bounding width slice—leads to missing parts in irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond place_block (which should be fixed, not discarded); find_components is essential and accurate for extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct), but placements are severely misaligned—e.g., top rows have 2/4/3 blobs crammed left with 9's filling right, but expected likely needs left (8-containing, like the 8/1/7/3 blobs mid-grid) flush left and right (no-8, like top 2/4/3 and bottom 6/3) flush right with gaps.
 * Specific differences: Row0: 9's then 2's starting col12 (too left; expected probably 9's full left or separated); row6: 8's at col16-20 but with 2/3 below misplaced; row16: 2/6 then 8/3/2/3 all jumbled leftward instead of split sides; bottom row21 all 9's (ok) but row20 has 8's in middle not right-flushed.
 * No vertical blocks seem grouped properly—e.g., the mid 8/1/7 block (rows7-12) should be a left block starting col0, but it's shifted right with 9's left; right blocks like bottom 2/6/3 not ending at col21.
 * Overall, doesn't match puzzle rules: Horizontal concatenation within blocks is broken (overlaps/gaps wrong), and side placement ignores flush rules—looks like partial left-placement only, ignoring right flush and block grouping.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 18:51:16] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 18:55:27] Response:
### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious and consistent interconnections or interactions between elements across **all** examples (train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably relate or affect each other in every case, without forcing unsubstantiated patterns. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., inconsistent pixel changes in large structures, variable color swaps, or position-specific merges that do not occur uniformly) are included. Transformations like exact movement rules, color shifts, or merging mechanics are unknown where not consistently explainable.

1. **Nesting in Small Pairs (Outer Ring and Inner Filled Square)**:
   - **Components**: Outer ring (holes=1, pixels=16, bbox span of 4 units in x and y) and inner filled square (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox span of 2 units in x and y).
   - **Interconnection**: Positional containment—inner bbox is always strictly inset by exactly 1 unit from the outer bbox in all directions (e.g., outer [a,b,c,d] pairs with inner [a+1, b+1, c-1, d-1]). This affects the inner's position directly via the outer's location.
   - **Additional Properties**: Colors of outer and inner are always different; outer color does not transform to match inner (or vice versa) in a consistent way across pairs. Hole count of outer (1) is consistently tied to the presence of exactly one inner (filling the "hole").
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input and output; all small nested structures (8-10 per image) follow this exact relation without exception.

2. **Full-Canvas Structure and Containment of Small Elements**:
   - **Components**: Large full-canvas structure (bbox=[0,0,21,21], high pixels ~270-330, variable holes >0 when present) and all small nested pairs/standalones (the 8-10 small elements).
   - **Interconnection**: Spatial containment—all small elements' bboxes are always fully within the full-canvas bbox when the large structure is present. This affects the small elements' effective positioning relative to the canvas.
   - **Transformation Effect**: When a full-canvas structure with holes >0 exists in the input, its hole count is consistently transformed to 0 in the output (e.g., input holes=6 → output holes=0 in train 2; input holes=4 → output holes=0 in train 3). Pixel count may or may not change (unknown rule). No full-canvas in train input 1 (consistent with absence).
   - **Consistency**: The holes=0 transformation occurs in every case where a holed full-canvas is present in input (trains 2 and 3); no counterexamples. Small elements are always contained, affecting their "context" uniformly.

### Unknowns
- How/why specific small pairs disassemble into standalones (e.g., inner freed from outer) or why outers merge into medium/large rings (holes>1, pixels>16)—not consistent across all examples (e.g., some Green inners free in train 1 but stay nested in train 3).
- Color-position interactions (e.g., potential adjacency-based swaps or merges between Red/Maroon)—occur variably, not in every puzzle or for all instances.
- Pixel changes in full-canvas (e.g., -10 in train 2, unchanged in train 3)—no consistent trigger identifiable.
- Role of standalone filled squares (holes=0, pixels=9)—they appear without direct ties to others beyond general containment, no uniform interaction.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 18:55:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious and consistent interconnections or interactions between elements across **all** examples (train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably relate or affect each other in every case, without forcing unsubstantiated patterns. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., inconsistent pixel changes in large structures, variable color swaps, or position-specific merges that do not occur uniformly) are included. Transformations like exact movement rules, color shifts, or merging mechanics are unknown where not consistently explainable.

1. **Nesting in Small Pairs (Outer Ring and Inner Filled Square)**:
   - **Components**: Outer ring (holes=1, pixels=16, bbox span of 4 units in x and y) and inner filled square (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox span of 2 units in x and y).
   - **Interconnection**: Positional containment—inner bbox is always strictly inset by exactly 1 unit from the outer bbox in all directions (e.g., outer [a,b,c,d] pairs with inner [a+1, b+1, c-1, d-1]). This affects the inner's position directly via the outer's location.
   - **Additional Properties**: Colors of outer and inner are always different; outer color does not transform to match inner (or vice versa) in a consistent way across pairs. Hole count of outer (1) is consistently tied to the presence of exactly one inner (filling the "hole").
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input and output; all small nested structures (8-10 per image) follow this exact relation without exception.

2. **Full-Canvas Structure and Containment of Small Elements**:
   - **Components**: Large full-canvas structure (bbox=[0,0,21,21], high pixels ~270-330, variable holes >0 when present) and all small nested pairs/standalones (the 8-10 small elements).
   - **Interconnection**: Spatial containment—all small elements' bboxes are always fully within the full-canvas bbox when the large structure is present. This affects the small elements' effective positioning relative to the canvas.
   - **Transformation Effect**: When a full-canvas structure with holes >0 exists in the input, its hole count is consistently transformed to 0 in the output (e.g., input holes=6 → output holes=0 in train 2; input holes=4 → output holes=0 in train 3). Pixel count may or may not change (unknown rule). No full-canvas in train input 1 (consistent with absence).
   - **Consistency**: The holes=0 transformation occurs in every case where a holed full-canvas is present in input (trains 2 and 3); no counterexamples. Small elements are always contained, affecting their "context" uniformly.

### Unknowns
- How/why specific small pairs disassemble into standalones (e.g., inner freed from outer) or why outers merge into medium/large rings (holes>1, pixels>16)—not consistent across all examples (e.g., some Green inners free in train 1 but stay nested in train 3).
- Color-position interactions (e.g., potential adjacency-based swaps or merges between Red/Maroon)—occur variably, not in every puzzle or for all instances.
- Pixel changes in full-canvas (e.g., -10 in train 2, unchanged in train 3)—no consistent trigger identifiable.
- Role of standalone filled squares (holes=0, pixels=9)—they appear without direct ties to others beyond general containment, no uniform interaction.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 19:23:47] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 19:24:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves generating a Python program defining a 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case, following specific puzzle rules for extraction, manipulation, or transformation of those elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive, no variations like 'Program' or 'main'), which is evaluated against inputs; without it, all results fail with an extraction error.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid inputs (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual patterns, such as blobs, holes, dividers, or keys, requiring extraction of objects (e.g., connected components, shapes) before applying rules like omission based on properties (e.g., hole count, shape matching).
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like components not spanning the full grid, mismatched blob shapes (possibly due to incorrect connectivity rules, e.g., 4-way vs. 8-way), or keys that don't stretch entirely, which could cause omissions or mismatches.
 * Outputs must match expected formats precisely (e.g., specific strings, grids, or values for each training example); partial matches or syntax errors lead to failures.
 * Consider connectivity in grids (e.g., flood-fill for objects), counting features like holes or borders, and ensuring the 'program' function handles variable grid sizes without hardcoding.
 * All attempts so far failed due to missing the core 'program' function, so future generations must prioritize boilerplate structure before logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as the code lacked even the basic 'program' function. Future attempts should include utilities like grid traversal or object extraction (e.g., a flood-fill to identify connected components), but none are available here to reuse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed identically with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating no valid code structure was produced.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no puzzle logic (e.g., object extraction, rule application) could be tested or evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the requirement to define a 'program' function, making it completely non-functional.
 * No helpful functions were included; any prior code snippets (if any) would be irrelevant without the core function.
 * This attempt is broken at the foundational level—do not reuse any generated code from it, as it contains no executable or puzzle-relevant elements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR ("Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as no actual processing or output was produced for the test input grid.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, the test case couldn't be mentally simulated or compared to expected results (e.g., correct object extraction or rule application for the specific test grid patterns).
 * It differs from expectations because a correct test output should produce a valid result (e.g., a transformed grid, string, or value matching puzzle rules), but here nothing was generated—likely the expected output involves handling unique test elements like irregular shapes or keys, which couldn't be addressed.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 19:26:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear and interact in the same way across **all** train puzzles (i.e., present and behaving identically in train 1, 2, and 3). I focused only on direct, observable links (e.g., spatial containment, property correlations) without inferring or forcing unobservable rules, semantic meanings, or puzzle solutions. Connections that vary (e.g., specific color pairs remaining nested vs. extracted, or transformations of the large canvas shape) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained consistently. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., individual colors without links, non-interacting positions) are excluded. Only standard small shapes (h=0 p=9 squares and h=1 p=16 frames) are included, as larger or variant shapes (e.g., p=10 bars, canvas-sized shapes) do not interact consistently across all examples.

- **Nesting (containment interaction: position -> hole count and shape properties)**:  
  In every train input and output, every standard outer shape (holes=1, pixels=16, bbox span of 5x5 units) contains exactly one standard inner shape (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox span of 3x3 units) via complete spatial containment (inner bbox fully inside outer bbox, typically centered with 1-unit margin). The inner's position directly determines the outer's hole count (set to 1), and the pair shares a consistent size ratio (inner is ~36% the area of the outer's filled pixels). This interaction is present in all examples (multiple instances per puzzle) and unchanged in outputs unless the pair is separated (unknown transformation for separation).

- **Inner-to-outer property linkage (color -> position, pixels -> holes)**:  
  In every train input and output, the color of a standard inner shape (holes=0, pixels=9) is paired with the color of its containing outer shape (holes=1, pixels=16), with the inner's position locked relative to the outer (contained as above). Pixels of the inner (always 9) correlate inversely with the outer's effective filled area (16 pixels accounting for the single hole). This color-position pairing is consistent for all nested pairs across all examples, though specific color combinations vary and do not drive a consistent transformation (e.g., some pairs separate in outputs; unknown rule).

- **Standard shape sizing (pixels <-> bbox <-> holes)**:  
  Across every train input and output, all standard inner shapes (holes=0) have exactly pixels=9 and bbox span of 3x3 units, while all standard outer shapes (holes=1) have exactly pixels=16 and bbox span of 5x5 units. Holes=0 always implies solid fill (no sub-containment), and holes=1 always implies one sub-containment (as in nesting above). This property link is invariant and present in every puzzle for all small shapes.

- **Merged outers (limited consistency: hole count <-> pixels <-> position containment)**:  
  In train 1, 2 (output), and 3 (output), merged outer shapes (holes=n>1, pixels=16*n, bbox larger than 5x5) consistently contain exactly n standard inner shapes (holes=0, pixels=9; loose, not nested in smaller outers) via complete spatial containment within their bbox. However, this interaction is absent in train 2 input and train 1 output's full set (no merged outers in some cases), so it is not fully consistent across every puzzle instance—only the property correlation (when present) is invariant. Color of merged outer is always maroon or red, but no consistent link to contained inners' colors (unknown).

Unknowns (consistent but unexplained):  
- Spatial rearrangements (position -> position): All small shapes change positions between input and output in every train example, but the transformation rule (e.g., left/right sorting, grouping) is unknown and not consistently explainable from properties like color or holes.  
- Canvas/large shape interactions: Large shapes ([0,0,21,21] bbox) appear in train 2 and 3 (holes>0 input to holes=0 output; pixels vary or stay same), but absent in train 1 listings, so no consistent interaction with small shapes across all puzzles (e.g., no uniform hole count link to small inners).  
- Extraction (nesting -> independence): Some nested pairs separate (inner becomes loose holes=0 p=9 outside any outer) in every output, but which pairs and why (e.g., color-based?) is unknown and inconsistent (varies by example). No forced explanation.  
- Color effects: Colors link to nesting (as above), but no consistent effect on movement, merging, or transformation across all examples (e.g., same color inners behave differently depending on outer or position; unknown).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:33:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear and interact in the same way across **all** train puzzles (i.e., present and behaving identically in train 1, 2, and 3). I focused only on direct, observable links (e.g., spatial containment, property correlations) without inferring or forcing unobservable rules, semantic meanings, or puzzle solutions. Connections that vary (e.g., specific color pairs remaining nested vs. extracted, or transformations of the large canvas shape) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained consistently. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., individual colors without links, non-interacting positions) are excluded. Only standard small shapes (h=0 p=9 squares and h=1 p=16 frames) are included, as larger or variant shapes (e.g., p=10 bars, canvas-sized shapes) do not interact consistently across all examples.

- **Nesting (containment interaction: position -> hole count and shape properties)**:  
  In every train input and output, every standard outer shape (holes=1, pixels=16, bbox span of 5x5 units) contains exactly one standard inner shape (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox span of 3x3 units) via complete spatial containment (inner bbox fully inside outer bbox, typically centered with 1-unit margin). The inner's position directly determines the outer's hole count (set to 1), and the pair shares a consistent size ratio (inner is ~36% the area of the outer's filled pixels). This interaction is present in all examples (multiple instances per puzzle) and unchanged in outputs unless the pair is separated (unknown transformation for separation).

- **Inner-to-outer property linkage (color -> position, pixels -> holes)**:  
  In every train input and output, the color of a standard inner shape (holes=0, pixels=9) is paired with the color of its containing outer shape (holes=1, pixels=16), with the inner's position locked relative to the outer (contained as above). Pixels of the inner (always 9) correlate inversely with the outer's effective filled area (16 pixels accounting for the single hole). This color-position pairing is consistent for all nested pairs across all examples, though specific color combinations vary and do not drive a consistent transformation (e.g., some pairs separate in outputs; unknown rule).

- **Standard shape sizing (pixels <-> bbox <-> holes)**:  
  Across every train input and output, all standard inner shapes (holes=0) have exactly pixels=9 and bbox span of 3x3 units, while all standard outer shapes (holes=1) have exactly pixels=16 and bbox span of 5x5 units. Holes=0 always implies solid fill (no sub-containment), and holes=1 always implies one sub-containment (as in nesting above). This property link is invariant and present in every puzzle for all small shapes.

- **Merged outers (limited consistency: hole count <-> pixels <-> position containment)**:  
  In train 1, 2 (output), and 3 (output), merged outer shapes (holes=n>1, pixels=16*n, bbox larger than 5x5) consistently contain exactly n standard inner shapes (holes=0, pixels=9; loose, not nested in smaller outers) via complete spatial containment within their bbox. However, this interaction is absent in train 2 input and train 1 output's full set (no merged outers in some cases), so it is not fully consistent across every puzzle instance—only the property correlation (when present) is invariant. Color of merged outer is always maroon or red, but no consistent link to contained inners' colors (unknown).

Unknowns (consistent but unexplained):  
- Spatial rearrangements (position -> position): All small shapes change positions between input and output in every train example, but the transformation rule (e.g., left/right sorting, grouping) is unknown and not consistently explainable from properties like color or holes.  
- Canvas/large shape interactions: Large shapes ([0,0,21,21] bbox) appear in train 2 and 3 (holes>0 input to holes=0 output; pixels vary or stay same), but absent in train 1 listings, so no consistent interaction with small shapes across all puzzles (e.g., no uniform hole count link to small inners).  
- Extraction (nesting -> independence): Some nested pairs separate (inner becomes loose holes=0 p=9 outside any outer) in every output, but which pairs and why (e.g., color-based?) is unknown and inconsistent (varies by example). No forced explanation.  
- Color effects: Colors link to nesting (as above), but no consistent effect on movement, merging, or transformation across all examples (e.g., same color inners behave differently depending on outer or position; unknown).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Program:
```python
from typing import List

def flip_horizontal(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flip the grid horizontally (mirror left-right)."""
    return [row[::-1] for row in g]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Apply horizontal flip as a simple transformation."""
    return flip_horizontal(g)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 19:42:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations, likely rotations or reflections of shapes/objects within a larger grid background (filled with 0s or borders), where the goal is to apply a consistent rule to rearrange or reorient elements to match the expected output. The previous attempt used a simple horizontal flip, which failed to produce the correct rearrangements seen in the expected outputs, suggesting the transformation is more complex, such as a 90-degree rotation or targeted object manipulation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids are 22x22 (22 rows, each with 22 integers), with 0s as background/borders and non-zero numbers (1-9) representing colored shapes or objects that must be preserved in form but repositioned/oriented differently.
 * Expected outputs show shapes "migrating" across the grid: e.g., in training example 1, clusters of 8s, 5s, 3s, 2s, 1s, 9s, 6s, and 4s shift from right/center positions in generated to left/top in expected, indicating a rotational or mirroring transformation rather than simple left-right flip.
 * Subtle element: Shapes maintain their internal structure (e.g., a 3x3 block of 3s stays connected) but change orientation/position; borders (e.g., 8s or 4s) may act as frames that also transform.
 * Objects appear to be "extractable" as blobs (connected components of the same number), and the puzzle may involve rotating individual objects or the whole grid by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a center point.
 * Key consideration: Background 0s must remain 0s in the same positions post-transformation, but non-zero regions shift without overlapping or distorting.
 * Easy to miss: The transformation isn't uniform across the grid—some shapes (e.g., vertical stacks of 8s in train 1 expected) suggest partial rotations or reflections over vertical/horizontal axes, not just global flip.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), no object extraction was used, leading to wholesale grid manipulation that ignores shape boundaries.
 * Numbers 1-9 likely represent distinct "colors" or identities that must stay consistent within their blobs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided in the attempt; the flip_horizontal is basic but incorrect for this puzzle as it only reverses rows without addressing rotations or object isolation.

```python
def flip_horizontal(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flip the grid horizontally (mirror left-right)."""
    return [row[::-1] for row in g]
```
(This function is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it produces left-right mirrors that don't match expected positional shifts; avoid using it in future attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt applied a global horizontal flip to the entire grid, which reversed left-right positions of all elements (e.g., in train 1, 8s moved from left to right, but expected has them on left with vertical stacking).
 * What worked: Nothing— all three training examples failed (marked INCORRECT), as the flip preserved row order but inverted columns, while expected outputs show row-column swaps and reorientations (e.g., train 1 generated has horizontal 8s on right, expected has vertical 8s on left; train 2 generated keeps shapes in place but flipped, expected rotates upper shapes downward).
 * What didn't work: Failed to rotate or transpose the grid (e.g., train 3 generated has 8s and 6s in original orientations, expected rotates the top 8-3-2 cluster to the left side); no object detection, so connected components weren't isolated and transformed independently.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 5s and 8s horizontally aligned on right/middle, expected shifts them to left with 5s embedded vertically in 8s; 9s and 6s are flipped but not rotated (unknown why positions don't align—possibly needs 90-degree counterclockwise rotation).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated flips 4s and 8s horizontally, but expected rotates the 8-9-3 block downward and left, with 1s and 6s reoriented vertically; bottom 8-6 block is mirrored incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 2-3 and 8-6 clusters mostly horizontal and right-aligned, expected rotates them leftward (e.g., 2-3-2 becomes vertical on left); 4s and 5s are displaced wrong.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., finding connected components of same-number cells) was attempted, which is essential for handling individual shape rotations without affecting background.
 * Global flip ignores subtle border behaviors (e.g., 1s or 4s as frames in train 2/3 expected wrap differently post-rotation).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same horizontal flip as training, resulting in shapes like 8-4-3 on right flipped to left but still horizontal, and 2-6-3 clusters mirrored without rotation (e.g., top 9-border with embedded 2-4 stays row-wise reversed, bottom 8-3 with 2-6-3 is left-right inverted).
 * This does not look correct: Expected likely involves 90-degree rotation (e.g., vertical stacks of 9s on left, rotated 2-4-3 downward like in train 1), as the current output keeps horizontal orientations and doesn't match the positional migrations in training expecteds (e.g., 7s and 1s in middle should shift to top/left, but they're just flipped; unknown exact rotation direction, but flip alone fails).
 * Test output is missing rotational reorientation (e.g., the 8-7-1 block should become vertical, similar to train 3's 8-6 shift); it over-applies left-right mirroring to borders (9s), creating incorrect symmetry.
 * To handle test case, must account for new numbers (7s, possibly a new shape) by extracting and rotating blobs, ensuring no overlap with 9-background.

[2025-10-02 19:42:57] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in **every** train example (input 1, 2, 3 and their outputs). I focused only on patterns that hold universally, such as spatial relationships, property dependencies, and structural effects. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated color occurrences without interaction, inconsistent pixel variations not tied to other properties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are included; unknown aspects (e.g., exact rules for position shifts or why specific components merge) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Spatial Containment (Position → Structure/Holes)**
   - **Description**: The bounding box (bbox) of an inner component (holes=0, pixels=9) is strictly contained within the bbox of a frame component (holes ≥1, pixels ≥16). This containment directly affects the structural detection of the frame, as the inner occupies space inside the frame's perimeter.
   - **Interacting Components**: Inner (solid square) and frame (border square).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every panel across all inputs and outputs. For example:
     - Single inners: Always 1 inner per holes=1 frame (e.g., input 1: Orange bbox [2,2,4,4] inside Maroon [1,1,5,5]).
     - Multiple inners: Always N inners per holes=N frame (e.g., output 1: Light Blue, Green, Pink, Yellow bboxes all inside Red holes=4 [12,7,21,20]).
   - **Effect**: Containment enforces no overlap between the inner's bbox and the frame's outer edges; inners cannot extend beyond the frame. This relation is preserved in structure but repositions dynamically between input/output (exact repositioning rule unknown).
   - **No Exceptions**: Holds for all detected nested pairs; lone inners (not contained) have no frame interaction.

#### 2. **Hole Count Dependency (Enclosure Count → Holes Property)**
   - **Description**: The holes property of a frame component (holes ≥1) is directly determined by the number of inner components (holes=0, pixels=9) it encloses via spatial containment. Holes = exact count of directly enclosed inners.
   - **Interacting Components**: Frame (outer border, variable size) and multiple inners (solid squares).
   - **Consistency**: Universal for all frame components in every example. Examples:
     - Holes=1 frames always enclose exactly 1 inner (e.g., input 2: all 7 holes=1 frames each enclose 1 inner like Green [1,9,3,11] in Maroon [0,8,4,12]).
     - Holes=2 frames always enclose exactly 2 inners (e.g., output 2: Maroon [0,14,9,20] encloses Blue [1,15,3,17] and Pink [6,17,8,19]).
     - Higher (e.g., holes=4 in output 1: Red [12,7,21,20] encloses exactly 4 inners: Light Blue, Green, Pink, Yellow).
   - **Effect**: Enclosure count modifies the frame's holes property (e.g., adding an inner increases holes by 1). Pixels of frame scale with size/enclosures (e.g., ~16 per single, ~32 for doubles), but exact pixel-holes link is consistent in scaling direction only.
   - **Note on Large Canvas Component**: For the full-canvas component (bbox ~[0,0,21,21], pixels >200, when present in inputs 2/3), high holes (e.g., 6 or 4) correlate with enclosing all small components, but the count does not match total inners/frames exactly (possibly due to nested sub-enclosures counting as 1 hole each; exact sub-rule unknown). In all outputs, this component's holes transform to 0 (no enclosures detected), affecting its structure independently of small frames.

#### 3. **Color Distinction Within Enclosure (Color → Containment Eligibility)**
   - **Description**: A frame component's color differs from all colors of inners it encloses. This prevents same-color merging within a single enclosure.
   - **Interacting Components**: Frame color and enclosed inner(s) colors.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to every enclosed pair/group across all examples. No frame encloses an inner of the same color (e.g., input 3: No Red frame encloses Red inner [4,2,6,4]; output 3: Maroon holes=2 encloses Red and Pink, not Maroon).
   - **Effect**: Color mismatch enables/allows containment; same-color components cannot nest (they remain separate or merge differently, e.g., multiple Reds may form a larger Red frame elsewhere). Colors from the set (e.g., Red, Green, Maroon) interact only via this exclusion—no evidence of color-based attraction/repulsion for positioning.
   - **No Cross-Enclosure Effect**: Colors do not propagate between separate frames (e.g., one frame's inner color does not affect another's holes).

#### 4. **Dynamic Enclosure Changes (Input/Output Transformation → Enclosure Relations)**
   - **Description**: Lone inner components (holes=0, not enclosed in input) can become enclosed by a frame in output, or vice versa, altering hole counts of affected frames. This affects grouping but preserves the containment rule.
   - **Interacting Components**: Lone inners and existing/new frames.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every input/output pair, with some lones gaining/losing enclosures (e.g., input 1: Lone Pink/Yellow become enclosed in Red holes=2; output 1: Lone Orange/Green become enclosed in Maroon holes=2). No component starts enclosed and ends with its own sub-enclosure (inners remain holes=0).
   - **Effect**: Changes enclosure status, which cascades to holes property (e.g., adding 2 lones to a frame increases its holes by 2). Positions shift to enable new containments (e.g., clustered in input → spaced in output), but transformation trigger (e.g., proximity, color sequence) is unknown.
   - **Limitation**: Not all lones change status consistently (some stay lone), so only the potential for dynamic enclosure is universal.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Aspects Noted
- **Position Transformations**: All small components (frames and inners) have bboxes repositioned, resized slightly, or reoriented (e.g., input 1 Red-Blue pair shifts from x9-13 to x17-21) between input/output. This affects containment but follows no obvious consistent rule (e.g., not uniform shift, rotation, or color-based; called unknown).
- **Merging Triggers**: When/why specific frames merge multiple inners (e.g., all Reds into one holes=4 in output 1) is not consistently explainable by position, color, or holes alone (e.g., no universal color-matching for merges; unknown).
- **Large Canvas Color Persistence**: When present, the large component retains its color (e.g., Yellow in input/output 2) but changes holes to 0; no interaction with small component colors observed.
- **Pixel Variations**: Minor pixel changes (e.g., 284 → 274 for large in input/output 2) occur but do not consistently link to other properties like holes or enclosures (irrelevant to interactions).
- No consistent color → movement effects (e.g., Green does not always shift similarly), position → color changes, or hole count → color links beyond enclosure distinction.

These are the only interactions that are obvious, directly observable, and hold without exception across all train examples. No irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., background color change from black to blue, isolated rotations without enclosure impact) are included.

[2025-10-02 19:44:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in **every** train example (input 1, 2, 3 and their outputs). I focused only on patterns that hold universally, such as spatial relationships, property dependencies, and structural effects. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated color occurrences without interaction, inconsistent pixel variations not tied to other properties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are included; unknown aspects (e.g., exact rules for position shifts or why specific components merge) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Spatial Containment (Position → Structure/Holes)**
   - **Description**: The bounding box (bbox) of an inner component (holes=0, pixels=9) is strictly contained within the bbox of a frame component (holes ≥1, pixels ≥16). This containment directly affects the structural detection of the frame, as the inner occupies space inside the frame's perimeter.
   - **Interacting Components**: Inner (solid square) and frame (border square).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every panel across all inputs and outputs. For example:
     - Single inners: Always 1 inner per holes=1 frame (e.g., input 1: Orange bbox [2,2,4,4] inside Maroon [1,1,5,5]).
     - Multiple inners: Always N inners per holes=N frame (e.g., output 1: Light Blue, Green, Pink, Yellow bboxes all inside Red holes=4 [12,7,21,20]).
   - **Effect**: Containment enforces no overlap between the inner's bbox and the frame's outer edges; inners cannot extend beyond the frame. This relation is preserved in structure but repositions dynamically between input/output (exact repositioning rule unknown).
   - **No Exceptions**: Holds for all detected nested pairs; lone inners (not contained) have no frame interaction.

#### 2. **Hole Count Dependency (Enclosure Count → Holes Property)**
   - **Description**: The holes property of a frame component (holes ≥1) is directly determined by the number of inner components (holes=0, pixels=9) it encloses via spatial containment. Holes = exact count of directly enclosed inners.
   - **Interacting Components**: Frame (outer border, variable size) and multiple inners (solid squares).
   - **Consistency**: Universal for all frame components in every example. Examples:
     - Holes=1 frames always enclose exactly 1 inner (e.g., input 2: all 7 holes=1 frames each enclose 1 inner like Green [1,9,3,11] in Maroon [0,8,4,12]).
     - Holes=2 frames always enclose exactly 2 inners (e.g., output 2: Maroon [0,14,9,20] encloses Blue [1,15,3,17] and Pink [6,17,8,19]).
     - Higher (e.g., holes=4 in output 1: Red [12,7,21,20] encloses exactly 4 inners: Light Blue, Green, Pink, Yellow).
   - **Effect**: Enclosure count modifies the frame's holes property (e.g., adding an inner increases holes by 1). Pixels of frame scale with size/enclosures (e.g., ~16 per single, ~32 for doubles), but exact pixel-holes link is consistent in scaling direction only.
   - **Note on Large Canvas Component**: For the full-canvas component (bbox ~[0,0,21,21], pixels >200, when present in inputs 2/3), high holes (e.g., 6 or 4) correlate with enclosing all small components, but the count does not match total inners/frames exactly (possibly due to nested sub-enclosures counting as 1 hole each; exact sub-rule unknown). In all outputs, this component's holes transform to 0 (no enclosures detected), affecting its structure independently of small frames.

#### 3. **Color Distinction Within Enclosure (Color → Containment Eligibility)**
   - **Description**: A frame component's color differs from all colors of inners it encloses. This prevents same-color merging within a single enclosure.
   - **Interacting Components**: Frame color and enclosed inner(s) colors.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to every enclosed pair/group across all examples. No frame encloses an inner of the same color (e.g., input 3: No Red frame encloses Red inner [4,2,6,4]; output 3: Maroon holes=2 encloses Red and Pink, not Maroon).
   - **Effect**: Color mismatch enables/allows containment; same-color components cannot nest (they remain separate or merge differently, e.g., multiple Reds may form a larger Red frame elsewhere). Colors from the set (e.g., Red, Green, Maroon) interact only via this exclusion—no evidence of color-based attraction/repulsion for positioning.
   - **No Cross-Enclosure Effect**: Colors do not propagate between separate frames (e.g., one frame's inner color does not affect another's holes).

#### 4. **Dynamic Enclosure Changes (Input/Output Transformation → Enclosure Relations)**
   - **Description**: Lone inner components (holes=0, not enclosed in input) can become enclosed by a frame in output, or vice versa, altering hole counts of affected frames. This affects grouping but preserves the containment rule.
   - **Interacting Components**: Lone inners and existing/new frames.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every input/output pair, with some lones gaining/losing enclosures (e.g., input 1: Lone Pink/Yellow become enclosed in Red holes=2; output 1: Lone Orange/Green become enclosed in Maroon holes=2). No component starts enclosed and ends with its own sub-enclosure (inners remain holes=0).
   - **Effect**: Changes enclosure status, which cascades to holes property (e.g., adding 2 lones to a frame increases its holes by 2). Positions shift to enable new containments (e.g., clustered in input → spaced in output), but transformation trigger (e.g., proximity, color sequence) is unknown.
   - **Limitation**: Not all lones change status consistently (some stay lone), so only the potential for dynamic enclosure is universal.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Aspects Noted
- **Position Transformations**: All small components (frames and inners) have bboxes repositioned, resized slightly, or reoriented (e.g., input 1 Red-Blue pair shifts from x9-13 to x17-21) between input/output. This affects containment but follows no obvious consistent rule (e.g., not uniform shift, rotation, or color-based; called unknown).
- **Merging Triggers**: When/why specific frames merge multiple inners (e.g., all Reds into one holes=4 in output 1) is not consistently explainable by position, color, or holes alone (e.g., no universal color-matching for merges; unknown).
- **Large Canvas Color Persistence**: When present, the large component retains its color (e.g., Yellow in input/output 2) but changes holes to 0; no interaction with small component colors observed.
- **Pixel Variations**: Minor pixel changes (e.g., 284 → 274 for large in input/output 2) occur but do not consistently link to other properties like holes or enclosures (irrelevant to interactions).
- No consistent color → movement effects (e.g., Green does not always shift similarly), position → color changes, or hole count → color links beyond enclosure distinction.

These are the only interactions that are obvious, directly observable, and hold without exception across all train examples. No irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., background color change from black to blue, isolated rotations without enclosure impact) are included.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 19:54:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (likely 22x22 based on context) where the task is to detect, analyze, and regroup "components" such as frames and enclosed inner shapes based on properties like colors, bounding boxes, holes, and spatial relationships, then reposition or redraw them in a standardized output grid following specific placement rules (e.g., frames with inners in columns, standardized sizes). The goal appears to be transforming the input to match a canonical representation, preserving distinctions like frame colors (e.g., 2 and 8) and handling enclosures/holes, but the provided program fails entirely due to runtime errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined by non-zero colors; 0 is background/empty, and colors like 2 and 8 seem special as preferred frame colors, while others may be inners or frames with holes.
 * Bounding boxes must be computed accurately for each color's pixels to check spatial containment (inners strictly inside frames) and estimate holes via pixel deficits (e.g., assuming square shapes and ~9 pixels per hole, but this is a simplification that may overestimate/underestimate for non-square or irregular shapes).
 * Enclosures require strict distinction: frame color != inner colors, and inners must be fully contained within the frame's bbox without touching borders; regrouping dynamically assigns inners (hole-free) to frames, limiting to ~2 per frame, alternating frame colors (2/8), and handling large canvases (full-grid spanning components) by flattening them as solid backgrounds.
 * Placement rules emphasize standardization: use 5x5 frames for single inners (3x3 centered), larger/stacked for multiples; position in two columns (left for color 8, right for 2), starting from row 1, with vertical stacking and spacing; overwrite large backgrounds but ensure small placements fit within grid bounds (e.g., avoid index errors on 22x22 grid).
 * Subtle elements: Holes are estimated, not directly counted (may miss irregular holes); regrouping preserves color order (sort ascending) and checks distinctions per group; large components (bbox 0,0,n-1,n-1) act as backgrounds but need holes flattened to 0; potential for multiple components per color (though code assumes one bbox per color, which may merge disconnected parts incorrectly).
 * Easy-to-miss: Spatial containment is strict (<, not <=) to avoid border touching; output must handle empty inners gracefully; canvas size is fixed (n x n, likely 22); errors arise from out-of-bounds placements or undefined helpers (e.g., if grid size mismatches assumptions).
 * All considerations: Detect all colors excluding 0; handle cases with no inners/holes; sort and alternate frames to balance; for test inputs, likely involve mixed frames/inners/large backgrounds that require precise regrouping to avoid overlaps or omissions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            if g[r][c] == color:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)

        return 0
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
    height, width = max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
    expected_solid = height * width
    actual_pixels = sum(1 for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1) for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1) if g[r][c] == color)
    deficit = expected_solid - actual_pixels
    return max(0, deficit // 9)

def is_spatially_contained(inner: Tuple[int, int, int, int], outer: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    """Checks if inner bbox is strictly inside outer bbox (no border touching). Key for enclosure detection."""
    i_min_r, i_max_r, i_min_c, i_max_c = inner
    o_min_r, o_max_r, o_min_c, o_max_c = outer
    return (o_min_r < i_min_r and i_max_r < o_max_r and o_min_c < i_min_c and i_max_c < o_max_c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to detect components via colors, bboxes, and holes, then regroup inners (hole=0) into frames (colors 2/8) with up to 2 per frame, which aligns with puzzle rules for enclosures and distinction but fails due to execution errors (likely index out-of-bounds in placement or undefined variables).
 * What worked: Core detection functions (get_present_colors, compute_bounding_box, estimate_holes) are logically sound and could extract objects accurately; spatial containment check is strict and correct for inners.
 * What didn't work: Regrouping logic mishandles components (e.g., assumes single bbox per color, clears inners_by_color prematurely, sorts all_inners but doesn't use bboxes for multiples); placement causes errors (e.g., stacking inners with idx*6 in 5x5/11x11 frames overflows grid bounds on 22x22; left/right columns at 1/17 with step=6 may exceed width; place_standard_frame draws borders but stacks inners incorrectly for n_inners>1).
 * find_contained_inners is incomplete/broken (relies on global g but doesn't fully integrate with regroup; skips seen_colors properly but assumes whole component inner without pixel checks).
 * regroup_enclosures is overcomplicated and erroneous (groups only hole=0 as inners but treats hole>0 as frames without bbox usage; alternates frames but doesn't handle large canvases in grouping).
 * place_components detects large backgrounds correctly but flattens them while overwriting, leading to potential conflicts; col starts (1/17) and row_step=6 assume 22x22 but error on smaller tests (training examples likely smaller grids, causing index errors).
 * detect_components is helpful for extracting all (color, holes, bbox) but program doesn't use it fully (calls regroup directly, skipping containment).
 * Overall, no training examples passed (all ERROR - Execution error: 1 or 2, likely IndexError or TypeError from bbox None or out-of-bounds); errors suggest unhandled edge cases like empty grids, no inners, or mismatched n.
 * Function place_standard_frame is partially helpful for drawing but broken for multiple inners (hardcoded stacking ignores actual bbox sizes); check_color_distinction is simple but correct.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: The main program() flow is flawed (chains detect -> regroup -> place without error handling); estimate_holes placeholder is too simplistic (deficit//9 assumes 3x3 holes but may count background as holes incorrectly); find_contained_inners not called in main, making it unused/irrelevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test input result is ERROR - Execution error: 2, which does not look correct (no grid output generated, indicating a runtime crash rather than a valid transformation).
 * Similar to training examples (all errors: Train1=2, Train2/3=1), suggesting the code fails universally on index bounds or None bboxes, especially if test has large components or sparse placements that trigger out-of-bounds in place_standard_frame or compute_bounding_box on non-22x22 grids.
 * Expected test output should be a regrouped grid with frames in left/right columns, solid large background if present, and centered 3x3 inners without overlaps, but errors prevent any generation—likely missing strict bounds checks (e.g., if start_row + height > n) or handling for n<22.
 * Differences from expected: No output at all vs. a structured 22x22 grid with colors 2/8 as frames enclosing sorted inners; unknown exact test grid, but errors imply it has components causing placement overflow (e.g., many frames exceeding row_step*num).

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed **in every train example** (inputs 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact (e.g., via containment, influence on position/movement, or transformation) and appear identically across all cases. No high-level interpretations, total solutions, or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., isolated properties without cross-example consistency) are included. Only direct, observable links are noted. Where a potential interaction cannot be confirmed as consistent (e.g., due to anomalies like pixel count variations), it is called out as unknown rather than speculated.

   - **Description**: Every small solid shape (holes=0, pixels=9) has its bbox strictly contained within the bbox of exactly one larger holed shape (holes>=1, pixels>=16). This forms a direct enclosure interaction, where the inner shape's position is nested inside the outer's boundaries.
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Inner: holes=0, pixels=9, small bbox (width/height ≈2-3 units).
     - Outer: holes>=1, pixels=16 (for holes=1) or higher (e.g., 32 for holes=2), larger bbox.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every input and output. No small solid shape exists without an enclosing holed shape. Bboxes do not overlap; each small is enclosed by precisely one outer (no shared enclosures). This interaction affects position (inners move/transform with their outers).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The outer's bbox boundaries constrain and influence the inner's position. No transformation of inner properties (e.g., color, holes) occurs independently of this enclosure.

#### 2. **Color-Based Grouping and Positional Movement (Maroon Enclosures)**
   - **Description**: Shapes directly or indirectly enclosed by Maroon-colored (holes>=1) components in the input are consistently moved and grouped into one or more Maroon-colored holed containers (holes>=1) positioned on the left side of the overall arrangement (bbox x-coordinates starting from ≈0, spanning left ≈half of the canvas width, e.g., x=0-9).
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Enclosed shapes: Any inner (holes=0, pixels=9) originally nested in a Maroon outer, or small solids contained in a Maroon higher-holes shape.
     - Container: Maroon-colored, holes>=1, pixels>=16, larger bbox on left side.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train input/output pair. All Maroon-enclosed elements (e.g., Orange, Green, Light Blue, Yellow, Pink, Blue, Red(holes=0) as inners) relocate to left-side Maroon containers. No exceptions; non-Maroon-enclosed shapes never join these groups.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The original enclosing Maroon color determines the destination container's color and triggers leftward movement/transformation of the group. Individual inner colors remain unchanged, but their positions are affected by the group's relocation (e.g., scattered to organized nesting within left containers).

#### 3. **Color-Based Grouping and Positional Movement (Red Enclosures)**
   - **Description**: Shapes directly or indirectly enclosed by Red-colored (holes>=1) components in the input are consistently moved and grouped into one or more Red-colored holed containers (holes>=1) positioned on the right side of the overall arrangement (bbox x-coordinates starting from ≈12-17, spanning right ≈half of the canvas width, e.g., x=12-21).
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Enclosed shapes: Any inner (holes=0, pixels=9) originally nested in a Red outer, or small solids (e.g., alone Pinks/Yellows) contained in a Red higher-holes shape.
     - Container: Red-colored, holes>=1, pixels>=16, larger bbox on right side.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train input/output pair. All Red-enclosed elements (e.g., Blue, Green, Light Blue, Orange, Pink, Yellow) relocate to right-side Red containers. Includes treatment of "alone" small solids (e.g., input Pink/Yellow in Red holes=2) as Red-enclosed. No exceptions; Maroon-enclosed shapes never join these groups.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The original enclosing Red color determines the destination container's color and triggers rightward movement/transformation of the group. Individual inner colors remain unchanged, but their positions are affected by the group's relocation (e.g., from scattered to nested within right containers). Dark Red (test-only) not evaluated for consistency.

#### 4. **Background Color Transformation**
   - **Description**: The overall background changes from black (input) to blue (output), independent of shape components but affecting the visual context for all elements.
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Background: Uniform color layer behind all shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train input/output pair (explicitly noted; no shape-level conflict with blue as a shape color).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: This global change influences visibility/movement perception of all shapes (e.g., contrast with colored squares), but does not alter shape properties (color, holes, pixels, bbox). No direct shape-background interaction beyond contextual effect.

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Interactions (Called Out per Instructions)
- **Hole Count and Enclosure Count**: Hole values (e.g., holes=2,4) often align with the number of directly enclosed small solids (holes=0, pixels=9) in containers (e.g., holes=2 encloses 2 smalls in most cases), but this is not consistent across every example (e.g., train 2 output has Red holes=2 enclosing 3 smalls). Cannot confirm as a reliable interaction; treated as unknown.
- **Pixel Count Variations**: Small shapes (holes=0) consistently have pixels=9, and medium (holes=1) have pixels=16, but larger shapes show multiples (e.g., 32=2×16, 64=4×16) only sometimes. Anomaly in train 2 output (pixels=10 for a small shape) linked to possible rotation (thin bbox [17,0,21,1]), but effect on pixels/bbox cannot be explained consistently; treated as unknown.
- **Full-Canvas Shape Transformation**: In train 2 and 3, the large full-bbox shape (bbox≈[0,0,21,21], pixels≈270-330, high holes in input) changes to holes=0 with color preserved (Yellow or Blue) and pixels approximately unchanged/slightly decreased. Absent in train 1 (no full-canvas component), so not consistent across every puzzle; treated as unknown.
- **Rotation/Mirroring Effects**: Outputs show rotated/mirrored elements (e.g., altered bboxes), but specific triggers (e.g., color -> rotation) are not consistently identifiable across all examples; treated as unknown.
- **Other Color Interactions**: No consistent links for non-Maroon/Red colors (e.g., no reliable position effect for Yellow/Blue/Light Blue as outers beyond full-canvas cases). Inners like Green appear in both left/right groups depending on original outer, but no independent color-driven effect.

No other interactions (e.g., position -> color, hole count -> color, specific shape transforms) are obvious and consistent across every example. Irrelevant elements (e.g., scattered non-nested shapes without enclosure, inconsistent pixel anomalies) are excluded.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:58:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves generating a Python program defining a 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case, following specific puzzle rules for extraction, manipulation, or transformation of those elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive, no variations like 'Program' or 'main'), which is evaluated against inputs; without it, all results fail with an extraction error.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid inputs (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual patterns, such as blobs, holes, dividers, or keys, requiring extraction of objects (e.g., connected components, shapes) before applying rules like omission based on properties (e.g., hole count, shape matching).
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like components not spanning the full grid, mismatched blob shapes (possibly due to incorrect connectivity rules, e.g., 4-way vs. 8-way), or keys that don't stretch entirely, which could cause omissions or mismatches.
 * Outputs must match expected formats precisely (e.g., specific strings, grids, or values for each training example); partial matches or syntax errors lead to failures.
 * Consider connectivity in grids (e.g., flood-fill for objects), counting features like holes or borders, and ensuring the 'program' function handles variable grid sizes without hardcoding.
 * All attempts so far failed due to missing the core 'program' function, so future generations must prioritize boilerplate structure before logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as the code lacked even the basic 'program' function. Future attempts should include utilities like grid traversal or object extraction (e.g., a flood-fill to identify connected components), but none are available here to reuse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed identically with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating no valid code structure was produced.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no puzzle logic (e.g., object extraction, rule application) could be tested or evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the requirement to define a 'program' function, making it completely non-functional.
 * No helpful functions were included; any prior code snippets (if any) would be irrelevant without the core function.
 * This attempt is broken at the foundational level—do not reuse any generated code from it, as it contains no executable or puzzle-relevant elements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR ("Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as no actual processing or output was produced for the test input grid.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, the test case couldn't be mentally simulated or compared to expected results (e.g., correct object extraction or rule application for the specific test grid patterns).
 * It differs from expectations because a correct test output should produce a valid result (e.g., a transformed grid, string, or value matching puzzle rules), but here nothing was generated—likely the expected output involves handling unique test elements like irregular shapes or keys, which couldn't be addressed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations, likely rotations or reflections of shapes/objects within a larger grid background (filled with 0s or borders), where the goal is to apply a consistent rule to rearrange or reorient elements to match the expected output. The previous attempt used a simple horizontal flip, which failed to produce the correct rearrangements seen in the expected outputs, suggesting the transformation is more complex, such as a 90-degree rotation or targeted object manipulation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids are 22x22 (22 rows, each with 22 integers), with 0s as background/borders and non-zero numbers (1-9) representing colored shapes or objects that must be preserved in form but repositioned/oriented differently.
 * Expected outputs show shapes "migrating" across the grid: e.g., in training example 1, clusters of 8s, 5s, 3s, 2s, 1s, 9s, 6s, and 4s shift from right/center positions in generated to left/top in expected, indicating a rotational or mirroring transformation rather than simple left-right flip.
 * Subtle element: Shapes maintain their internal structure (e.g., a 3x3 block of 3s stays connected) but change orientation/position; borders (e.g., 8s or 4s) may act as frames that also transform.
 * Objects appear to be "extractable" as blobs (connected components of the same number), and the puzzle may involve rotating individual objects or the whole grid by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a center point.
 * Key consideration: Background 0s must remain 0s in the same positions post-transformation, but non-zero regions shift without overlapping or distorting.
 * Easy to miss: The transformation isn't uniform across the grid—some shapes (e.g., vertical stacks of 8s in train 1 expected) suggest partial rotations or reflections over vertical/horizontal axes, not just global flip.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), no object extraction was used, leading to wholesale grid manipulation that ignores shape boundaries.
 * Numbers 1-9 likely represent distinct "colors" or identities that must stay consistent within their blobs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided in the attempt; the flip_horizontal is basic but incorrect for this puzzle as it only reverses rows without addressing rotations or object isolation.

```python
def flip_horizontal(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flip the grid horizontally (mirror left-right)."""
    return [row[::-1] for row in g]
```
(This function is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it produces left-right mirrors that don't match expected positional shifts; avoid using it in future attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt applied a global horizontal flip to the entire grid, which reversed left-right positions of all elements (e.g., in train 1, 8s moved from left to right, but expected has them on left with vertical stacking).
 * What worked: Nothing— all three training examples failed (marked INCORRECT), as the flip preserved row order but inverted columns, while expected outputs show row-column swaps and reorientations (e.g., train 1 generated has horizontal 8s on right, expected has vertical 8s on left; train 2 generated keeps shapes in place but flipped, expected rotates upper shapes downward).
 * What didn't work: Failed to rotate or transpose the grid (e.g., train 3 generated has 8s and 6s in original orientations, expected rotates the top 8-3-2 cluster to the left side); no object detection, so connected components weren't isolated and transformed independently.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 5s and 8s horizontally aligned on right/middle, expected shifts them to left with 5s embedded vertically in 8s; 9s and 6s are flipped but not rotated (unknown why positions don't align—possibly needs 90-degree counterclockwise rotation).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated flips 4s and 8s horizontally, but expected rotates the 8-9-3 block downward and left, with 1s and 6s reoriented vertically; bottom 8-6 block is mirrored incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 2-3 and 8-6 clusters mostly horizontal and right-aligned, expected rotates them leftward (e.g., 2-3-2 becomes vertical on left); 4s and 5s are displaced wrong.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., finding connected components of same-number cells) was attempted, which is essential for handling individual shape rotations without affecting background.
 * Global flip ignores subtle border behaviors (e.g., 1s or 4s as frames in train 2/3 expected wrap differently post-rotation).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same horizontal flip as training, resulting in shapes like 8-4-3 on right flipped to left but still horizontal, and 2-6-3 clusters mirrored without rotation (e.g., top 9-border with embedded 2-4 stays row-wise reversed, bottom 8-3 with 2-6-3 is left-right inverted).
 * This does not look correct: Expected likely involves 90-degree rotation (e.g., vertical stacks of 9s on left, rotated 2-4-3 downward like in train 1), as the current output keeps horizontal orientations and doesn't match the positional migrations in training expecteds (e.g., 7s and 1s in middle should shift to top/left, but they're just flipped; unknown exact rotation direction, but flip alone fails).
 * Test output is missing rotational reorientation (e.g., the 8-7-1 block should become vertical, similar to train 3's 8-6 shift); it over-applies left-right mirroring to borders (9s), creating incorrect symmetry.
 * To handle test case, must account for new numbers (7s, possibly a new shape) by extracting and rotating blobs, ensuring no overlap with 9-background.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (likely 22x22 based on context) where the task is to detect, analyze, and regroup "components" such as frames and enclosed inner shapes based on properties like colors, bounding boxes, holes, and spatial relationships, then reposition or redraw them in a standardized output grid following specific placement rules (e.g., frames with inners in columns, standardized sizes). The goal appears to be transforming the input to match a canonical representation, preserving distinctions like frame colors (e.g., 2 and 8) and handling enclosures/holes, but the provided program fails entirely due to runtime errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined by non-zero colors; 0 is background/empty, and colors like 2 and 8 seem special as preferred frame colors, while others may be inners or frames with holes.
 * Bounding boxes must be computed accurately for each color's pixels to check spatial containment (inners strictly inside frames) and estimate holes via pixel deficits (e.g., assuming square shapes and ~9 pixels per hole, but this is a simplification that may overestimate/underestimate for non-square or irregular shapes).
 * Enclosures require strict distinction: frame color != inner colors, and inners must be fully contained within the frame's bbox without touching borders; regrouping dynamically assigns inners (hole-free) to frames, limiting to ~2 per frame, alternating frame colors (2/8), and handling large canvases (full-grid spanning components) by flattening them as solid backgrounds.
 * Placement rules emphasize standardization: use 5x5 frames for single inners (3x3 centered), larger/stacked for multiples; position in two columns (left for color 8, right for 2), starting from row 1, with vertical stacking and spacing; overwrite large backgrounds but ensure small placements fit within grid bounds (e.g., avoid index errors on 22x22 grid).
 * Subtle elements: Holes are estimated, not directly counted (may miss irregular holes); regrouping preserves color order (sort ascending) and checks distinctions per group; large components (bbox 0,0,n-1,n-1) act as backgrounds but need holes flattened to 0; potential for multiple components per color (though code assumes one bbox per color, which may merge disconnected parts incorrectly).
 * Easy-to-miss: Spatial containment is strict (<, not <=) to avoid border touching; output must handle empty inners gracefully; canvas size is fixed (n x n, likely 22); errors arise from out-of-bounds placements or undefined helpers (e.g., if grid size mismatches assumptions).
 * All considerations: Detect all colors excluding 0; handle cases with no inners/holes; sort and alternate frames to balance; for test inputs, likely involve mixed frames/inners/large backgrounds that require precise regrouping to avoid overlaps or omissions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set

def get_present_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Set[int]:
    """Extracts all unique non-zero colors from the grid. Useful for identifying frames and inners."""
    return {cell for row in g for cell in row if cell != 0}
```

```python
def compute_bounding_box(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Computes the minimal bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for all pixels of a given color.
    Returns None if no pixels found. Essential for spatial checks and hole estimation."""
    n = len(g)
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = n, -1, n, -1
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(n):
            if g[r][c] == color:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)
                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) if min_r <= max_r else None
```

```python
def estimate_holes(g: List[List[int]], color: int, bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> int:
    """Estimates holes by calculating pixel deficit in the bounding box (expected solid area minus actual pixels).
    Assumes ~9 pixels per hole (for 3x3 inners); returns 0 if no bbox. Helpful but approximate—may fail for non-square shapes."""
    if bbox is None:
        return 0
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
    height, width = max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
    expected_solid = height * width
    actual_pixels = sum(1 for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1) for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1) if g[r][c] == color)
    deficit = expected_solid - actual_pixels
    return max(0, deficit // 9)
```

```python
def is_spatially_contained(inner: Tuple[int, int, int, int], outer: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    """Checks if inner bbox is strictly inside outer bbox (no border touching). Key for enclosure detection."""
    i_min_r, i_max_r, i_min_c, i_max_c = inner
    o_min_r, o_max_r, o_min_c, o_max_c = outer
    return (o_min_r < i_min_r and i_max_r < o_max_r and o_min_c < i_min_c and i_max_c < o_max_c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to detect components via colors, bboxes, and holes, then regroup inners (hole=0) into frames (colors 2/8) with up to 2 per frame, which aligns with puzzle rules for enclosures and distinction but fails due to execution errors (likely index out-of-bounds in placement or undefined variables).
 * What worked: Core detection functions (get_present_colors, compute_bounding_box, estimate_holes) are logically sound and could extract objects accurately; spatial containment check is strict and correct for inners.
 * What didn't work: Regrouping logic mishandles components (e.g., assumes single bbox per color, clears inners_by_color prematurely, sorts all_inners but doesn't use bboxes for multiples); placement causes errors (e.g., stacking inners with idx*6 in 5x5/11x11 frames overflows grid bounds on 22x22; left/right columns at 1/17 with step=6 may exceed width; place_standard_frame draws borders but stacks inners incorrectly for n_inners>1).
 * find_contained_inners is incomplete/broken (relies on global g but doesn't fully integrate with regroup; skips seen_colors properly but assumes whole component inner without pixel checks).
 * regroup_enclosures is overcomplicated and erroneous (groups only hole=0 as inners but treats hole>0 as frames without bbox usage; alternates frames but doesn't handle large canvases in grouping).
 * place_components detects large backgrounds correctly but flattens them while overwriting, leading to potential conflicts; col starts (1/17) and row_step=6 assume 22x22 but error on smaller tests (training examples likely smaller grids, causing index errors).
 * detect_components is helpful for extracting all (color, holes, bbox) but program doesn't use it fully (calls regroup directly, skipping containment).
 * Overall, no training examples passed (all ERROR - Execution error: 1 or 2, likely IndexError or TypeError from bbox None or out-of-bounds); errors suggest unhandled edge cases like empty grids, no inners, or mismatched n.
 * Function place_standard_frame is partially helpful for drawing but broken for multiple inners (hardcoded stacking ignores actual bbox sizes); check_color_distinction is simple but correct.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: The main program() flow is flawed (chains detect -> regroup -> place without error handling); estimate_holes placeholder is too simplistic (deficit//9 assumes 3x3 holes but may count background as holes incorrectly); find_contained_inners not called in main, making it unused/irrelevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test input result is ERROR - Execution error: 2, which does not look correct (no grid output generated, indicating a runtime crash rather than a valid transformation).
 * Similar to training examples (all errors: Train1=2, Train2/3=1), suggesting the code fails universally on index bounds or None bboxes, especially if test has large components or sparse placements that trigger out-of-bounds in place_standard_frame or compute_bounding_box on non-22x22 grids.
 * Expected test output should be a regrouped grid with frames in left/right columns, solid large background if present, and centered 3x3 inners without overlaps, but errors prevent any generation—likely missing strict bounds checks (e.g., if start_row + height > n) or handling for n<22.
 * Differences from expected: No output at all vs. a structured 22x22 grid with colors 2/8 as frames enclosing sorted inners; unknown exact test grid, but errors imply it has components causing placement overflow (e.g., many frames exceeding row_step*num).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of colored integers representing shapes made of connected blocks, where the goal is to separate and rearrange "bordered" shapes (those containing the color 8, likely frames or outlines) onto the left side of a new output grid and "open" shapes (lacking 8) onto the right side, while handling background colors appropriately. The output preserves some structural aspects of the shapes but repositions them in a specific layout that combines elements from the original grid, rather than simple extraction and stacking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid, but it varies (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 8 across examples), and non-background components must be identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS on 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right) excluding background.
 * Shapes are connected components of non-background cells; single cells or small groups count as components if non-bg.
 * Classification: Bordered ('left') shapes contain at least one 8 (often as a frame around inner colors like 5,3,4); open ('right') shapes lack 8 entirely (e.g., solid blocks of 1,3,5,6,9).
 * Sorting: Components should be ordered by their topmost row (min row index) to maintain vertical sequence from the original grid.
 * Placement is not simple vertical stacking from row 0; instead, left-side shapes retain some original positional structure (e.g., bordered frames with inner shapes placed relative to their original rows, sometimes with extensions or merges), while right-side shapes are extracted and placed starting around column 17 but aligned to specific rows (not stacked contiguously—gaps or offsets occur based on original positions). Output grid is always 22x22, padded with background where needed.
 * Subtle elements: Bordered shapes on left often include the 8 frame intact, creating enclosed areas (e.g., 8 around 5's or 3's), and may overlap or extend horizontally into middle columns in the output; right shapes are "unframed" versions placed without borders, sometimes horizontally adjacent in the right panel. Gaps between shapes must match original relative spacing (not filled or stacked tightly). Background propagation: Left may use original bg or 8, right uses a consistent bg (often 0 or 2). Easy to miss: Some shapes span multiple rows/columns irregularly (not always rectangular), and output may include "divider" areas (e.g., columns 5-16 often bg or transitional). Components must ignore diagonal connections—only orthogonal. In some cases, large bg areas or full-row shapes (e.g., bottom bars of 4's) need special handling to avoid misplacement.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; shapes keep original colors. Output rows may have asymmetric lengths in description but are full 22 cols. Test input has complex nested shapes (e.g., 7 inside 8's on left, 9's as bg? on right), requiring careful component bounding without breaking frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS stack for flood-fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing various numbered cells (representing colored or shaped blobs) needs to be processed by identifying connected components (non-background blobs), separating them into "left" (those containing the number 8) and "right" (those without 8) groups, vertically grouping contiguous blocks of these components by row ranges, and then reassembling them side-by-side in a new 22x22 grid: left blocks placed flush left (starting at column 0) and right blocks placed flush right (starting at column 22 - total width), while preserving the relative row positions and internal shapes of each component without rotation or scaling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components with any cell equal to 8 are "left" (even if mixed numbers); those without 8 are "right"—this is a binary split, not per-number.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" only if their row ranges overlap or are adjacent (max row of previous +1 >= min row of next); sort blocks by starting row.
 * Within each block, sort components left-to-right by their original min column, then place them contiguously in the output: for left blocks, start at col 0; for right blocks, start at col (22 - sum of widths in block), where width = maxc - minc + 1.
 * When placing, copy exact cell values from original positions, but shift horizontally to the new contiguous position; do not alter rows, and only place if the target column is within 0-21 and the source cell is non-background.
 * Subtlety: Components may overlap in columns within a block, but placement concatenates their widths without merging or overlapping in output—treat as side-by-side abutment.
 * Easy to miss: 8 can appear anywhere in a left component (not just borders); right components never have 8; background cells in output start as bg but are overwritten only by non-bg source cells.
 * Vertical gaps between blocks are preserved (empty rows in output stay bg); no vertical shifting or compression.
 * Input grids are 22x22; output must be exactly 22x22; numbers like 1-9 represent distinct "colors" or shapes to preserve exactly.
 * Potential edge cases: Single-cell components; blocks spanning full height; components with irregular shapes (not rectangles, so use min/max for bounding but copy actual cells); multiple blocks per side; zero-width or empty blocks (skip).
 * No rotation, reflection, or color changes; preserve all non-bg cells' values and positions relatively.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, useful for all examples; e.g., 0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if comp:
                    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
                    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
                    minr, maxr = min(rs), max(rs)
                    minc, maxc = min(cs), max(cs)
                    has8 = any(g[r][c] == 8 for r, c in comp)
                    components.append((minr, maxr, minc, maxc, has8))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes and 8-flag is core and mostly correct; it accurately detects shapes in all examples but needs integration fixes for placement.)

```python
def group_blocks(shapes: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]]:
    blocks = []
    if not shapes:
        return blocks
    # Sort by minr first (missing in provided code; add: shapes = sorted(shapes, key=lambda x: x[0]))
    current_block = [shapes[0]]
    current_maxr = shapes[0][1]
    for s in shapes[1:]:
        minr = s[0]
        if minr > current_maxr + 1:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [s]
            current_maxr = s[1]
        else:
            current_block.append(s)
            current_maxr = max(current_maxr, s[1])
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This vertical grouping logic is helpful but buggy in provided code: assumes pre-sorted input and uses has8 tuple; needs sort by minr and strip has8 for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly identifies background (0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test) and finds components with 8-flag, splitting into left/right— this works for core detection in all cases.
 * Grouping into vertical blocks works partially (e.g., train2 correct overall), but fails when components in a block have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential order, as sorting by minr is missing/incomplete.
 * Placement logic in place_block is broken: sorts by minc but then uses original minc for copying (causing misalignment); computes widths correctly but shifts incorrectly (e.g., uses minc + k for source but current + k for target without full offset); only copies if source non-bg but doesn't handle full shape copy (misses non-rectangular fills).
 * Train1 incorrect: Left blocks (with 8) placed mostly correct but right blocks shifted left too far (e.g., row2: 2's start at col12 in generated vs col17 in expected; row7: extra 2's in cols11-16; row8: 2's and 3's misplaced horizontally); bottom section (rows14-21) has 6/2/4/8 blobs concatenated wrong, with 8's on left but expected has them integrated differently—no vertical gaps preserved properly.
 * Train2 correct: All placements match expected, suggesting the logic works for simpler vertical alignments without overlaps or gaps.
 * Train3 incorrect: Top row has extra 1's and misplaced 2's (generated row0: 1's then 2's vs expected 1's then 2's but shifted); right blocks (no 8) like 3/5/4 placed too leftward (e.g., row1: 3's at col16-18 in generated vs col17-19 expected; row13: 2's at end but extra 2's in row12); left blocks with 8 correct but overall horizontal concatenation fails for multi-component blocks.
 * In all incorrect cases, right-side placement starts too early (not at 22 - total_w), causing overlap or squeeze; left flush is better but still misaligns internals.
 * Function place_block is broken/not helpful as-is: incorrect offset (uses minc in source loop, causing partial copies); doesn't copy full component cells, only bounding width slice—leads to missing parts in irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond place_block (which should be fixed, not discarded); find_components is essential and accurate for extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct), but placements are severely misaligned—e.g., top rows have 2/4/3 blobs crammed left with 9's filling right, but expected likely needs left (8-containing, like the 8/1/7/3 blobs mid-grid) flush left and right (no-8, like top 2/4/3 and bottom 6/3) flush right with gaps.
 * Specific differences: Row0: 9's then 2's starting col12 (too left; expected probably 9's full left or separated); row6: 8's at col16-20 but with 2/3 below misplaced; row16: 2/6 then 8/3/2/3 all jumbled leftward instead of split sides; bottom row21 all 9's (ok) but row20 has 8's in middle not right-flushed.
 * No vertical blocks seem grouped properly—e.g., the mid 8/1/7 block (rows7-12) should be a left block starting col0, but it's shifted right with 9's left; right blocks like bottom 2/6/3 not ending at col21.
 * Overall, doesn't match puzzle rules: Horizontal concatenation within blocks is broken (overlaps/gaps wrong), and side placement ignores flush rules—looks like partial left-placement only, ignoring right flush and block grouping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

    count = [0] * 10

        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

(This is core for extracting connected frame components and their adjacent inners, returning bounding boxes and used cells; helpful for separation of left/right.)

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed **in every train example** (inputs 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact (e.g., via containment, influence on position/movement, or transformation) and appear identically across all cases. No high-level interpretations, total solutions, or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., isolated properties without cross-example consistency) are included. Only direct, observable links are noted. Where a potential interaction cannot be confirmed as consistent (e.g., due to anomalies like pixel count variations), it is called out as unknown rather than speculated.

#### 1. **Containment via Bounding Box (bbox) Hierarchy**
   - **Description**: Every small solid shape (holes=0, pixels=9) has its bbox strictly contained within the bbox of exactly one larger holed shape (holes>=1, pixels>=16). This forms a direct enclosure interaction, where the inner shape's position is nested inside the outer's boundaries.
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Inner: holes=0, pixels=9, small bbox (width/height ≈2-3 units).
     - Outer: holes>=1, pixels=16 (for holes=1) or higher (e.g., 32 for holes=2), larger bbox.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every input and output. No small solid shape exists without an enclosing holed shape. Bboxes do not overlap; each small is enclosed by precisely one outer (no shared enclosures). This interaction affects position (inners move/transform with their outers).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The outer's bbox boundaries constrain and influence the inner's position. No transformation of inner properties (e.g., color, holes) occurs independently of this enclosure.

#### 2. **Color-Based Grouping and Positional Movement (Maroon Enclosures)**
   - **Description**: Shapes directly or indirectly enclosed by Maroon-colored (holes>=1) components in the input are consistently moved and grouped into one or more Maroon-colored holed containers (holes>=1) positioned on the left side of the overall arrangement (bbox x-coordinates starting from ≈0, spanning left ≈half of the canvas width, e.g., x=0-9).
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Enclosed shapes: Any inner (holes=0, pixels=9) originally nested in a Maroon outer, or small solids contained in a Maroon higher-holes shape.
     - Container: Maroon-colored, holes>=1, pixels>=16, larger bbox on left side.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train input/output pair. All Maroon-enclosed elements (e.g., Orange, Green, Light Blue, Yellow, Pink, Blue, Red(holes=0) as inners) relocate to left-side Maroon containers. No exceptions; non-Maroon-enclosed shapes never join these groups.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The original enclosing Maroon color determines the destination container's color and triggers leftward movement/transformation of the group. Individual inner colors remain unchanged, but their positions are affected by the group's relocation (e.g., scattered to organized nesting within left containers).

#### 3. **Color-Based Grouping and Positional Movement (Red Enclosures)**
   - **Description**: Shapes directly or indirectly enclosed by Red-colored (holes>=1) components in the input are consistently moved and grouped into one or more Red-colored holed containers (holes>=1) positioned on the right side of the overall arrangement (bbox x-coordinates starting from ≈12-17, spanning right ≈half of the canvas width, e.g., x=12-21).
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Enclosed shapes: Any inner (holes=0, pixels=9) originally nested in a Red outer, or small solids (e.g., alone Pinks/Yellows) contained in a Red higher-holes shape.
     - Container: Red-colored, holes>=1, pixels>=16, larger bbox on right side.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train input/output pair. All Red-enclosed elements (e.g., Blue, Green, Light Blue, Orange, Pink, Yellow) relocate to right-side Red containers. Includes treatment of "alone" small solids (e.g., input Pink/Yellow in Red holes=2) as Red-enclosed. No exceptions; Maroon-enclosed shapes never join these groups.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The original enclosing Red color determines the destination container's color and triggers rightward movement/transformation of the group. Individual inner colors remain unchanged, but their positions are affected by the group's relocation (e.g., from scattered to nested within right containers). Dark Red (test-only) not evaluated for consistency.

#### 4. **Background Color Transformation**
   - **Description**: The overall background changes from black (input) to blue (output), independent of shape components but affecting the visual context for all elements.
   - **Interacting Properties/Components**:
     - Background: Uniform color layer behind all shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train input/output pair (explicitly noted; no shape-level conflict with blue as a shape color).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: This global change influences visibility/movement perception of all shapes (e.g., contrast with colored squares), but does not alter shape properties (color, holes, pixels, bbox). No direct shape-background interaction beyond contextual effect.

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Interactions (Called Out per Instructions)
- **Hole Count and Enclosure Count**: Hole values (e.g., holes=2,4) often align with the number of directly enclosed small solids (holes=0, pixels=9) in containers (e.g., holes=2 encloses 2 smalls in most cases), but this is not consistent across every example (e.g., train 2 output has Red holes=2 enclosing 3 smalls). Cannot confirm as a reliable interaction; treated as unknown.
- **Pixel Count Variations**: Small shapes (holes=0) consistently have pixels=9, and medium (holes=1) have pixels=16, but larger shapes show multiples (e.g., 32=2×16, 64=4×16) only sometimes. Anomaly in train 2 output (pixels=10 for a small shape) linked to possible rotation (thin bbox [17,0,21,1]), but effect on pixels/bbox cannot be explained consistently; treated as unknown.
- **Full-Canvas Shape Transformation**: In train 2 and 3, the large full-bbox shape (bbox≈[0,0,21,21], pixels≈270-330, high holes in input) changes to holes=0 with color preserved (Yellow or Blue) and pixels approximately unchanged/slightly decreased. Absent in train 1 (no full-canvas component), so not consistent across every puzzle; treated as unknown.
- **Rotation/Mirroring Effects**: Outputs show rotated/mirrored elements (e.g., altered bboxes), but specific triggers (e.g., color -> rotation) are not consistently identifiable across all examples; treated as unknown.
- **Other Color Interactions**: No consistent links for non-Maroon/Red colors (e.g., no reliable position effect for Yellow/Blue/Light Blue as outers beyond full-canvas cases). Inners like Green appear in both left/right groups depending on original outer, but no independent color-driven effect.

No other interactions (e.g., position -> color, hole count -> color, specific shape transforms) are obvious and consistent across every example. Irrelevant elements (e.g., scattered non-nested shapes without enclosure, inconsistent pixel anomalies) are excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:10:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

[2025-10-02 20:10:33] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Arrangement**: 8-9 scattered, non-grid positions per image, with input showing irregular clustering (e.g., top-left cluster, bottom-right singles) and output mirroring but rotated/flipped on blue field.

[2025-10-02 20:13:34] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs (1, 2, and 3), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **every** example. These are limited to properties that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a uniform way (e.g., spatial position influencing attribute values). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts without interaction, non-interacting colors), inconsistent patterns (e.g., varying large full-bbox hole counts), or forced explanations are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or transformation rule is inferred or provided—only direct, verifiable links. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact mechanism cannot be explained without additional data.

1. **Spatial Position (bbox inclusion) → Holes Property (for non-full-bbox shapes)**:
   - Components: Any shape with holes > 0 (outers, including small h=1 and medium/large h>1) interacts with h=0, pixels=9 shapes (standard inners).
   - Interaction: The bbox of a h>0 shape completely contains the bboxes of exactly "holes" number of h=0, p=9 inners. This defines the holes value for the outer.
   - Consistency: Holds in every train input and output for all non-full-bbox (i.e., bbox width/height <21) shapes. Examples:
     - Train input 1: Red h=2 [0,13,9,20] contains exactly 2 inners (Pink [1,14,3,16], Yellow [6,17,8,19]).
     - Train output 1: Red h=4 [12,7,21,20] contains exactly 4 inners (Green [13,8,15,10], Light Blue [18,10,20,12], Pink [13,14,15,16], Yellow [18,17,20,19]).
     - Train input 2: All 8 small h=1 shapes each contain exactly 1 inner (e.g., Red h=1 [8,0,12,4] contains Orange [9,1,11,3]).
     - Train output 2: Maroon h=2 [0,14,9,20] contains exactly 2 inners (Blue [1,15,3,17], Pink [6,17,8,19]).
     - Train input 3: All 6 small h=1 shapes each contain exactly 1 inner (e.g., Maroon h=1 [3,1,7,5] contains Red [4,2,6,4]).
     - Train output 3: Maroon h=2 [0,1,9,9] contains exactly 2 inners (Red [1,2,3,4], Pink [6,6,8,8]).
   - Note: h>0 shapes do not contain other h>0 shapes (no nested outers). Inners (h=0, p=9) do not contain anything. Non-standard h=0 shapes (e.g., output 2's Yellow h=0 p=10 [17,0,21,1]) may overlap bboxes but are not counted toward holes.
   - Unknown: Why some h=0, p=9 shapes shift from contained to uncontained (or vice versa) between input/output—bbox positions change, but the counting rule remains consistent.

2. **Background Color → Overall Field Transformation**:
   - Components: Implicit background (solid, no bbox listed) interacts with all shapes' rendering.
   - Interaction: Input background is always black; output background is always solid blue. This affects the visual field for all shapes (e.g., color contrasts emphasized in output).
   - Consistency: Present in every train input/output pair. No exceptions or variations.

3. **Shape Style Properties (edges, nesting) → Containment Interaction**:
   - Components: All shapes (h=0 and h>0) share flat vector style with sharp edges and no gradients/text.
   - Interaction: Nesting (via holes and bbox inclusion) relies on edge-defined silhouettes for containment—inners are fully enclosed within outer edges, affecting the outer's holes property (as in #1). No loose or partial overlaps create interactions.
   - Consistency: Uniform across every example; all nestings follow sharp-edge enclosure without edge intersections or transformations altering style.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No consistent color-based interactions**: Color pairs (e.g., outer Red with inner Green) vary without pattern across examples (e.g., input 1 has Red-Green, output 1 has Maroon-Orange). No reliable color → color, color → position, or color → holes link in every case.
- **Position → Position or Transformation**: Bbox positions shift/rotate/flip between input/output (e.g., clusters move from top-left to bottom-right), but no specific consistent rule (e.g., exact rotation angle or mirror axis) is obvious or uniform across all pairs—called unknown.
- **Full-bbox shapes (e.g., [0,0,21,21])**: Present in inputs 2 and 3 (h>0, varying holes like 6 or 4) and outputs 2 and 3 (always h=0, color/pixels similar but not identical, e.g., pixels 284→274). They encompass all other bboxes but do not follow the holes=contained inners rule (#1)—interaction with other components is spatial inclusion (all shapes inside), but holes mechanism is unknown and inconsistent (e.g., not equal to # of h=0 p=9 or h=1 shapes).
- **Pixels Property**: Varies with bbox size (e.g., small outers always 16, standard inners 9, larges >16), but no direct interaction with other properties (e.g., no pixels → holes or position) consistent across all.
- **Arrangement/Clustering**: Irregular scattering in inputs transforms to mirrored/rotated in outputs, but no specific position → grouping rule is obvious/consistent beyond containment (#1).
- No other connections (e.g., hole count → color, specific shape → transform) are obvious and present in every example. Elements like isolated h=0 p=9 shapes (uncontained) have no interactions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 20:13:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves generating a Python program defining a 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case, following specific puzzle rules for extraction, manipulation, or transformation of those elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive, no variations like 'Program' or 'main'), which is evaluated against inputs; without it, all results fail with an extraction error.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid inputs (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual patterns, such as blobs, holes, dividers, or keys, requiring extraction of objects (e.g., connected components, shapes) before applying rules like omission based on properties (e.g., hole count, shape matching).
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like components not spanning the full grid, mismatched blob shapes (possibly due to incorrect connectivity rules, e.g., 4-way vs. 8-way), or keys that don't stretch entirely, which could cause omissions or mismatches.
 * Outputs must match expected formats precisely (e.g., specific strings, grids, or values for each training example); partial matches or syntax errors lead to failures.
 * Consider connectivity in grids (e.g., flood-fill for objects), counting features like holes or borders, and ensuring the 'program' function handles variable grid sizes without hardcoding.
 * All attempts so far failed due to missing the core 'program' function, so future generations must prioritize boilerplate structure before logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as the code lacked even the basic 'program' function. Future attempts should include utilities like grid traversal or object extraction (e.g., a flood-fill to identify connected components), but none are available here to reuse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed identically with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating no valid code structure was produced.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no puzzle logic (e.g., object extraction, rule application) could be tested or evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the requirement to define a 'program' function, making it completely non-functional.
 * No helpful functions were included; any prior code snippets (if any) would be irrelevant without the core function.
 * This attempt is broken at the foundational level—do not reuse any generated code from it, as it contains no executable or puzzle-relevant elements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR ("Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as no actual processing or output was produced for the test input grid.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, the test case couldn't be mentally simulated or compared to expected results (e.g., correct object extraction or rule application for the specific test grid patterns).
 * It differs from expectations because a correct test output should produce a valid result (e.g., a transformed grid, string, or value matching puzzle rules), but here nothing was generated—likely the expected output involves handling unique test elements like irregular shapes or keys, which couldn't be addressed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations, likely rotations or reflections of shapes/objects within a larger grid background (filled with 0s or borders), where the goal is to apply a consistent rule to rearrange or reorient elements to match the expected output. The previous attempt used a simple horizontal flip, which failed to produce the correct rearrangements seen in the expected outputs, suggesting the transformation is more complex, such as a 90-degree rotation or targeted object manipulation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids are 22x22 (22 rows, each with 22 integers), with 0s as background/borders and non-zero numbers (1-9) representing colored shapes or objects that must be preserved in form but repositioned/oriented differently.
 * Expected outputs show shapes "migrating" across the grid: e.g., in training example 1, clusters of 8s, 5s, 3s, 2s, 1s, 9s, 6s, and 4s shift from right/center positions in generated to left/top in expected, indicating a rotational or mirroring transformation rather than simple left-right flip.
 * Subtle element: Shapes maintain their internal structure (e.g., a 3x3 block of 3s stays connected) but change orientation/position; borders (e.g., 8s or 4s) may act as frames that also transform.
 * Objects appear to be "extractable" as blobs (connected components of the same number), and the puzzle may involve rotating individual objects or the whole grid by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a center point.
 * Key consideration: Background 0s must remain 0s in the same positions post-transformation, but non-zero regions shift without overlapping or distorting.
 * Easy to miss: The transformation isn't uniform across the grid—some shapes (e.g., vertical stacks of 8s in train 1 expected) suggest partial rotations or reflections over vertical/horizontal axes, not just global flip.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), no object extraction was used, leading to wholesale grid manipulation that ignores shape boundaries.
 * Numbers 1-9 likely represent distinct "colors" or identities that must stay consistent within their blobs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided in the attempt; the flip_horizontal is basic but incorrect for this puzzle as it only reverses rows without addressing rotations or object isolation.

```python
def flip_horizontal(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flip the grid horizontally (mirror left-right)."""
    return [row[::-1] for row in g]
```
(This function is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it produces left-right mirrors that don't match expected positional shifts; avoid using it in future attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt applied a global horizontal flip to the entire grid, which reversed left-right positions of all elements (e.g., in train 1, 8s moved from left to right, but expected has them on left with vertical stacking).
 * What worked: Nothing— all three training examples failed (marked INCORRECT), as the flip preserved row order but inverted columns, while expected outputs show row-column swaps and reorientations (e.g., train 1 generated has horizontal 8s on right, expected has vertical 8s on left; train 2 generated keeps shapes in place but flipped, expected rotates upper shapes downward).
 * What didn't work: Failed to rotate or transpose the grid (e.g., train 3 generated has 8s and 6s in original orientations, expected rotates the top 8-3-2 cluster to the left side); no object detection, so connected components weren't isolated and transformed independently.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 5s and 8s horizontally aligned on right/middle, expected shifts them to left with 5s embedded vertically in 8s; 9s and 6s are flipped but not rotated (unknown why positions don't align—possibly needs 90-degree counterclockwise rotation).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated flips 4s and 8s horizontally, but expected rotates the 8-9-3 block downward and left, with 1s and 6s reoriented vertically; bottom 8-6 block is mirrored incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 2-3 and 8-6 clusters mostly horizontal and right-aligned, expected rotates them leftward (e.g., 2-3-2 becomes vertical on left); 4s and 5s are displaced wrong.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., finding connected components of same-number cells) was attempted, which is essential for handling individual shape rotations without affecting background.
 * Global flip ignores subtle border behaviors (e.g., 1s or 4s as frames in train 2/3 expected wrap differently post-rotation).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same horizontal flip as training, resulting in shapes like 8-4-3 on right flipped to left but still horizontal, and 2-6-3 clusters mirrored without rotation (e.g., top 9-border with embedded 2-4 stays row-wise reversed, bottom 8-3 with 2-6-3 is left-right inverted).
 * This does not look correct: Expected likely involves 90-degree rotation (e.g., vertical stacks of 9s on left, rotated 2-4-3 downward like in train 1), as the current output keeps horizontal orientations and doesn't match the positional migrations in training expecteds (e.g., 7s and 1s in middle should shift to top/left, but they're just flipped; unknown exact rotation direction, but flip alone fails).
 * Test output is missing rotational reorientation (e.g., the 8-7-1 block should become vertical, similar to train 3's 8-6 shift); it over-applies left-right mirroring to borders (9s), creating incorrect symmetry.
 * To handle test case, must account for new numbers (7s, possibly a new shape) by extracting and rotating blobs, ensuring no overlap with 9-background.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (likely 22x22 based on context) where the task is to detect, analyze, and regroup "components" such as frames and enclosed inner shapes based on properties like colors, bounding boxes, holes, and spatial relationships, then reposition or redraw them in a standardized output grid following specific placement rules (e.g., frames with inners in columns, standardized sizes). The goal appears to be transforming the input to match a canonical representation, preserving distinctions like frame colors (e.g., 2 and 8) and handling enclosures/holes, but the provided program fails entirely due to runtime errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined by non-zero colors; 0 is background/empty, and colors like 2 and 8 seem special as preferred frame colors, while others may be inners or frames with holes.
 * Bounding boxes must be computed accurately for each color's pixels to check spatial containment (inners strictly inside frames) and estimate holes via pixel deficits (e.g., assuming square shapes and ~9 pixels per hole, but this is a simplification that may overestimate/underestimate for non-square or irregular shapes).
 * Enclosures require strict distinction: frame color != inner colors, and inners must be fully contained within the frame's bbox without touching borders; regrouping dynamically assigns inners (hole-free) to frames, limiting to ~2 per frame, alternating frame colors (2/8), and handling large canvases (full-grid spanning components) by flattening them as solid backgrounds.
 * Placement rules emphasize standardization: use 5x5 frames for single inners (3x3 centered), larger/stacked for multiples; position in two columns (left for color 8, right for 2), starting from row 1, with vertical stacking and spacing; overwrite large backgrounds but ensure small placements fit within grid bounds (e.g., avoid index errors on 22x22 grid).
 * Subtle elements: Holes are estimated, not directly counted (may miss irregular holes); regrouping preserves color order (sort ascending) and checks distinctions per group; large components (bbox 0,0,n-1,n-1) act as backgrounds but need holes flattened to 0; potential for multiple components per color (though code assumes one bbox per color, which may merge disconnected parts incorrectly).
 * Easy-to-miss: Spatial containment is strict (<, not <=) to avoid border touching; output must handle empty inners gracefully; canvas size is fixed (n x n, likely 22); errors arise from out-of-bounds placements or undefined helpers (e.g., if grid size mismatches assumptions).
 * All considerations: Detect all colors excluding 0; handle cases with no inners/holes; sort and alternate frames to balance; for test inputs, likely involve mixed frames/inners/large backgrounds that require precise regrouping to avoid overlaps or omissions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to detect components via colors, bboxes, and holes, then regroup inners (hole=0) into frames (colors 2/8) with up to 2 per frame, which aligns with puzzle rules for enclosures and distinction but fails due to execution errors (likely index out-of-bounds in placement or undefined variables).
 * What worked: Core detection functions (get_present_colors, compute_bounding_box, estimate_holes) are logically sound and could extract objects accurately; spatial containment check is strict and correct for inners.
 * What didn't work: Regrouping logic mishandles components (e.g., assumes single bbox per color, clears inners_by_color prematurely, sorts all_inners but doesn't use bboxes for multiples); placement causes errors (e.g., stacking inners with idx*6 in 5x5/11x11 frames overflows grid bounds on 22x22; left/right columns at 1/17 with step=6 may exceed width; place_standard_frame draws borders but stacks inners incorrectly for n_inners>1).
 * find_contained_inners is incomplete/broken (relies on global g but doesn't fully integrate with regroup; skips seen_colors properly but assumes whole component inner without pixel checks).
 * regroup_enclosures is overcomplicated and erroneous (groups only hole=0 as inners but treats hole>0 as frames without bbox usage; alternates frames but doesn't handle large canvases in grouping).
 * place_components detects large backgrounds correctly but flattens them while overwriting, leading to potential conflicts; col starts (1/17) and row_step=6 assume 22x22 but error on smaller tests (training examples likely smaller grids, causing index errors).
 * detect_components is helpful for extracting all (color, holes, bbox) but program doesn't use it fully (calls regroup directly, skipping containment).
 * Overall, no training examples passed (all ERROR - Execution error: 1 or 2, likely IndexError or TypeError from bbox None or out-of-bounds); errors suggest unhandled edge cases like empty grids, no inners, or mismatched n.
 * Function place_standard_frame is partially helpful for drawing but broken for multiple inners (hardcoded stacking ignores actual bbox sizes); check_color_distinction is simple but correct.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: The main program() flow is flawed (chains detect -> regroup -> place without error handling); estimate_holes placeholder is too simplistic (deficit//9 assumes 3x3 holes but may count background as holes incorrectly); find_contained_inners not called in main, making it unused/irrelevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test input result is ERROR - Execution error: 2, which does not look correct (no grid output generated, indicating a runtime crash rather than a valid transformation).
 * Similar to training examples (all errors: Train1=2, Train2/3=1), suggesting the code fails universally on index bounds or None bboxes, especially if test has large components or sparse placements that trigger out-of-bounds in place_standard_frame or compute_bounding_box on non-22x22 grids.
 * Expected test output should be a regrouped grid with frames in left/right columns, solid large background if present, and centered 3x3 inners without overlaps, but errors prevent any generation—likely missing strict bounds checks (e.g., if start_row + height > n) or handling for n<22.
 * Differences from expected: No output at all vs. a structured 22x22 grid with colors 2/8 as frames enclosing sorted inners; unknown exact test grid, but errors imply it has components causing placement overflow (e.g., many frames exceeding row_step*num).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of colored integers representing shapes made of connected blocks, where the goal is to separate and rearrange "bordered" shapes (those containing the color 8, likely frames or outlines) onto the left side of a new output grid and "open" shapes (lacking 8) onto the right side, while handling background colors appropriately. The output preserves some structural aspects of the shapes but repositions them in a specific layout that combines elements from the original grid, rather than simple extraction and stacking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid, but it varies (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 8 across examples), and non-background components must be identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS on 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right) excluding background.
 * Shapes are connected components of non-background cells; single cells or small groups count as components if non-bg.
 * Classification: Bordered ('left') shapes contain at least one 8 (often as a frame around inner colors like 5,3,4); open ('right') shapes lack 8 entirely (e.g., solid blocks of 1,3,5,6,9).
 * Sorting: Components should be ordered by their topmost row (min row index) to maintain vertical sequence from the original grid.
 * Placement is not simple vertical stacking from row 0; instead, left-side shapes retain some original positional structure (e.g., bordered frames with inner shapes placed relative to their original rows, sometimes with extensions or merges), while right-side shapes are extracted and placed starting around column 17 but aligned to specific rows (not stacked contiguously—gaps or offsets occur based on original positions). Output grid is always 22x22, padded with background where needed.
 * Subtle elements: Bordered shapes on left often include the 8 frame intact, creating enclosed areas (e.g., 8 around 5's or 3's), and may overlap or extend horizontally into middle columns in the output; right shapes are "unframed" versions placed without borders, sometimes horizontally adjacent in the right panel. Gaps between shapes must match original relative spacing (not filled or stacked tightly). Background propagation: Left may use original bg or 8, right uses a consistent bg (often 0 or 2). Easy to miss: Some shapes span multiple rows/columns irregularly (not always rectangular), and output may include "divider" areas (e.g., columns 5-16 often bg or transitional). Components must ignore diagonal connections—only orthogonal. In some cases, large bg areas or full-row shapes (e.g., bottom bars of 4's) need special handling to avoid misplacement.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; shapes keep original colors. Output rows may have asymmetric lengths in description but are full 22 cols. Test input has complex nested shapes (e.g., 7 inside 8's on left, 9's as bg? on right), requiring careful component bounding without breaking frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS stack for flood-fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing various numbered cells (representing colored or shaped blobs) needs to be processed by identifying connected components (non-background blobs), separating them into "left" (those containing the number 8) and "right" (those without 8) groups, vertically grouping contiguous blocks of these components by row ranges, and then reassembling them side-by-side in a new 22x22 grid: left blocks placed flush left (starting at column 0) and right blocks placed flush right (starting at column 22 - total width), while preserving the relative row positions and internal shapes of each component without rotation or scaling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components with any cell equal to 8 are "left" (even if mixed numbers); those without 8 are "right"—this is a binary split, not per-number.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" only if their row ranges overlap or are adjacent (max row of previous +1 >= min row of next); sort blocks by starting row.
 * Within each block, sort components left-to-right by their original min column, then place them contiguously in the output: for left blocks, start at col 0; for right blocks, start at col (22 - sum of widths in block), where width = maxc - minc + 1.
 * When placing, copy exact cell values from original positions, but shift horizontally to the new contiguous position; do not alter rows, and only place if the target column is within 0-21 and the source cell is non-background.
 * Subtlety: Components may overlap in columns within a block, but placement concatenates their widths without merging or overlapping in output—treat as side-by-side abutment.
 * Easy to miss: 8 can appear anywhere in a left component (not just borders); right components never have 8; background cells in output start as bg but are overwritten only by non-bg source cells.
 * Vertical gaps between blocks are preserved (empty rows in output stay bg); no vertical shifting or compression.
 * Input grids are 22x22; output must be exactly 22x22; numbers like 1-9 represent distinct "colors" or shapes to preserve exactly.
 * Potential edge cases: Single-cell components; blocks spanning full height; components with irregular shapes (not rectangles, so use min/max for bounding but copy actual cells); multiple blocks per side; zero-width or empty blocks (skip).
 * No rotation, reflection, or color changes; preserve all non-bg cells' values and positions relatively.

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, useful for all examples; e.g., 0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test.)

                    components.append((minr, maxr, minc, maxc, has8))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes and 8-flag is core and mostly correct; it accurately detects shapes in all examples but needs integration fixes for placement.)

```python
def group_blocks(shapes: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]]:
    blocks = []
    if not shapes:
        return blocks
    # Sort by minr first (missing in provided code; add: shapes = sorted(shapes, key=lambda x: x[0]))
    current_block = [shapes[0]]
    current_maxr = shapes[0][1]
    for s in shapes[1:]:
        minr = s[0]
        if minr > current_maxr + 1:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [s]
            current_maxr = s[1]
        else:
            current_block.append(s)
            current_maxr = max(current_maxr, s[1])
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This vertical grouping logic is helpful but buggy in provided code: assumes pre-sorted input and uses has8 tuple; needs sort by minr and strip has8 for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly identifies background (0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test) and finds components with 8-flag, splitting into left/right— this works for core detection in all cases.
 * Grouping into vertical blocks works partially (e.g., train2 correct overall), but fails when components in a block have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential order, as sorting by minr is missing/incomplete.
 * Placement logic in place_block is broken: sorts by minc but then uses original minc for copying (causing misalignment); computes widths correctly but shifts incorrectly (e.g., uses minc + k for source but current + k for target without full offset); only copies if source non-bg but doesn't handle full shape copy (misses non-rectangular fills).
 * Train1 incorrect: Left blocks (with 8) placed mostly correct but right blocks shifted left too far (e.g., row2: 2's start at col12 in generated vs col17 in expected; row7: extra 2's in cols11-16; row8: 2's and 3's misplaced horizontally); bottom section (rows14-21) has 6/2/4/8 blobs concatenated wrong, with 8's on left but expected has them integrated differently—no vertical gaps preserved properly.
 * Train2 correct: All placements match expected, suggesting the logic works for simpler vertical alignments without overlaps or gaps.
 * Train3 incorrect: Top row has extra 1's and misplaced 2's (generated row0: 1's then 2's vs expected 1's then 2's but shifted); right blocks (no 8) like 3/5/4 placed too leftward (e.g., row1: 3's at col16-18 in generated vs col17-19 expected; row13: 2's at end but extra 2's in row12); left blocks with 8 correct but overall horizontal concatenation fails for multi-component blocks.
 * In all incorrect cases, right-side placement starts too early (not at 22 - total_w), causing overlap or squeeze; left flush is better but still misaligns internals.
 * Function place_block is broken/not helpful as-is: incorrect offset (uses minc in source loop, causing partial copies); doesn't copy full component cells, only bounding width slice—leads to missing parts in irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond place_block (which should be fixed, not discarded); find_components is essential and accurate for extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct), but placements are severely misaligned—e.g., top rows have 2/4/3 blobs crammed left with 9's filling right, but expected likely needs left (8-containing, like the 8/1/7/3 blobs mid-grid) flush left and right (no-8, like top 2/4/3 and bottom 6/3) flush right with gaps.
 * Specific differences: Row0: 9's then 2's starting col12 (too left; expected probably 9's full left or separated); row6: 8's at col16-20 but with 2/3 below misplaced; row16: 2/6 then 8/3/2/3 all jumbled leftward instead of split sides; bottom row21 all 9's (ok) but row20 has 8's in middle not right-flushed.
 * No vertical blocks seem grouped properly—e.g., the mid 8/1/7 block (rows7-12) should be a left block starting col0, but it's shifted right with 9's left; right blocks like bottom 2/6/3 not ending at col21.
 * Overall, doesn't match puzzle rules: Horizontal concatenation within blocks is broken (overlaps/gaps wrong), and side placement ignores flush rules—looks like partial left-placement only, ignoring right flush and block grouping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:

                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

                    shapes.append({'minr': minr, 'maxr': maxr, 'minc': minc, 'maxc': maxc})
    return shapes
```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

(This is core for extracting connected frame components and their adjacent inners, returning bounding boxes and used cells; helpful for separation of left/right.)

```python

    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs (1, 2, and 3), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **every** example. These are limited to properties that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a uniform way (e.g., spatial position influencing attribute values). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts without interaction, non-interacting colors), inconsistent patterns (e.g., varying large full-bbox hole counts), or forced explanations are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or transformation rule is inferred or provided—only direct, verifiable links. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact mechanism cannot be explained without additional data.

1. **Spatial Position (bbox inclusion) → Holes Property (for non-full-bbox shapes)**:
   - Components: Any shape with holes > 0 (outers, including small h=1 and medium/large h>1) interacts with h=0, pixels=9 shapes (standard inners).
   - Interaction: The bbox of a h>0 shape completely contains the bboxes of exactly "holes" number of h=0, p=9 inners. This defines the holes value for the outer.
   - Consistency: Holds in every train input and output for all non-full-bbox (i.e., bbox width/height <21) shapes. Examples:
     - Train input 1: Red h=2 [0,13,9,20] contains exactly 2 inners (Pink [1,14,3,16], Yellow [6,17,8,19]).
     - Train output 1: Red h=4 [12,7,21,20] contains exactly 4 inners (Green [13,8,15,10], Light Blue [18,10,20,12], Pink [13,14,15,16], Yellow [18,17,20,19]).
     - Train input 2: All 8 small h=1 shapes each contain exactly 1 inner (e.g., Red h=1 [8,0,12,4] contains Orange [9,1,11,3]).
     - Train output 2: Maroon h=2 [0,14,9,20] contains exactly 2 inners (Blue [1,15,3,17], Pink [6,17,8,19]).
     - Train input 3: All 6 small h=1 shapes each contain exactly 1 inner (e.g., Maroon h=1 [3,1,7,5] contains Red [4,2,6,4]).
     - Train output 3: Maroon h=2 [0,1,9,9] contains exactly 2 inners (Red [1,2,3,4], Pink [6,6,8,8]).
   - Note: h>0 shapes do not contain other h>0 shapes (no nested outers). Inners (h=0, p=9) do not contain anything. Non-standard h=0 shapes (e.g., output 2's Yellow h=0 p=10 [17,0,21,1]) may overlap bboxes but are not counted toward holes.
   - Unknown: Why some h=0, p=9 shapes shift from contained to uncontained (or vice versa) between input/output—bbox positions change, but the counting rule remains consistent.

2. **Background Color → Overall Field Transformation**:
   - Components: Implicit background (solid, no bbox listed) interacts with all shapes' rendering.
   - Interaction: Input background is always black; output background is always solid blue. This affects the visual field for all shapes (e.g., color contrasts emphasized in output).
   - Consistency: Present in every train input/output pair. No exceptions or variations.

3. **Shape Style Properties (edges, nesting) → Containment Interaction**:
   - Components: All shapes (h=0 and h>0) share flat vector style with sharp edges and no gradients/text.
   - Interaction: Nesting (via holes and bbox inclusion) relies on edge-defined silhouettes for containment—inners are fully enclosed within outer edges, affecting the outer's holes property (as in #1). No loose or partial overlaps create interactions.
   - Consistency: Uniform across every example; all nestings follow sharp-edge enclosure without edge intersections or transformations altering style.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No consistent color-based interactions**: Color pairs (e.g., outer Red with inner Green) vary without pattern across examples (e.g., input 1 has Red-Green, output 1 has Maroon-Orange). No reliable color → color, color → position, or color → holes link in every case.
- **Position → Position or Transformation**: Bbox positions shift/rotate/flip between input/output (e.g., clusters move from top-left to bottom-right), but no specific consistent rule (e.g., exact rotation angle or mirror axis) is obvious or uniform across all pairs—called unknown.
- **Full-bbox shapes (e.g., [0,0,21,21])**: Present in inputs 2 and 3 (h>0, varying holes like 6 or 4) and outputs 2 and 3 (always h=0, color/pixels similar but not identical, e.g., pixels 284→274). They encompass all other bboxes but do not follow the holes=contained inners rule (#1)—interaction with other components is spatial inclusion (all shapes inside), but holes mechanism is unknown and inconsistent (e.g., not equal to # of h=0 p=9 or h=1 shapes).
- **Pixels Property**: Varies with bbox size (e.g., small outers always 16, standard inners 9, larges >16), but no direct interaction with other properties (e.g., no pixels → holes or position) consistent across all.
- **Arrangement/Clustering**: Irregular scattering in inputs transforms to mirrored/rotated in outputs, but no specific position → grouping rule is obvious/consistent beyond containment (#1).
- No other connections (e.g., hole count → color, specific shape → transform) are obvious and present in every example. Elements like isolated h=0 p=9 shapes (uncontained) have no interactions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:25:01] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing a visual scene with a background color and various connected "components" (blobs of non-background cells, possibly representing objects like creatures or shapes). The goal is to extract these components, classify them based on whether they contain a special cell (value 8, perhaps indicating "eyes" or an entry point), group them into vertical "blocks" of overlapping or adjacent components, and repack them into a new grid by shifting left-classified blocks (with 8) to the left side and right-classified blocks (without 8) to the right side, while preserving their internal structure, vertical row positions, and horizontal tightness without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common cell value (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 or 9 in others), and all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components are bounding-boxed (min/max row/col) and flagged if they contain at least one 8 (treated as a boolean "has_e" or "has_eye"); 8 cells are part of the component but may need special handling (e.g., not erased during packing).
 * Grouping into blocks: Components are sorted by starting row (min_r), then merged into blocks if their row ranges overlap or are exactly adjacent (current max_r +1 >= next min_r); this creates horizontal "slices" of vertically coherent objects, but subtle gaps (e.g., single empty row) might break blocks incorrectly.
 * Packing: For each block, sort components by min_c (left-to-right order), compute total width, place left blocks starting at col 0 (left-aligned), right blocks starting at n - total_w (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row, col-by-col, but only non-bg cells—overwriting bg in output; preserve exact shapes, but ensure no horizontal stretching/compression beyond bounding box.
 * Subtle elements: Components may touch bg or each other without merging if different values (but code merges any non-bg, so assumes same/different values connect if adjacent—may over-merge heterogeneous blobs); 8 might be a "hole" or special marker inside components, but it's included in connectivity; vertical positions must stay exact (no row shifting); right-packing may leave gaps on left if total_w < n; in examples, some components span multiple rows/cols irregularly (e.g., L-shapes), so bounding-box copying can leave "holes" in output if not all cells are filled.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping row blocks might cause vertical stacking issues if not handled; sorting blocks by min_r ensures top-to-bottom order; in right-packing, if is_left=False, start col is max(0, n - total_w) to avoid negative indices; components without 8 go right, with 8 go left—strict binary split; no rotation/reflection, just translation; output initializes to bg everywhere.
 * Across attempts: Connectivity uses DFS/stack correctly for finding components; Counter for bg is reliable; but packing ignores relative horizontal offsets within blocks (just abuts bounding boxes), which may distort if components have internal spacing; no handling for components that touch edges or wrap; 8 detection works but may flag entire blobs wrong if 8 is bg-adjacent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies bg as most frequent value; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    all_comps = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                min_r = max_r = i
                min_c = max_c = j
                has_e = False
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if g[x][y] == 8:
                        has_e = True
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                all_comps.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, has_e))
    return all_comps
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes and 8-detection is core and mostly correct; handles irregular shapes via stack; useful for extraction.)

```python
def group_into_blocks(comps: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]]:
    if not comps:
        return []
    comps = sorted(comps, key=lambda x: x[0])
    blocks = []
    current_block = [comps[0]]
    cur_max_r = comps[0][1]
    for comp in comps[1:]:
        if comp[0] <= cur_max_r + 1:
            current_block.append(comp)
            cur_max_r = max(cur_max_r, comp[1])
        else:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [comp]
            cur_max_r = comp[1]
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This vertical grouping by row adjacency is helpful but subtle— +1 tolerance merges adjacent but may over-group if gaps are intentional; sorts by min_r correctly.)

```python
def pack_block(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], block: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]], bg: int, n: int, is_left: bool):
    if not block:
        return
    block = sorted(block, key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by min_c
    total_w = sum(x[3] - x[2] + 1 for x in block)
    curr_col = 0 if is_left else max(0, n - total_w)
    for comp in block:
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc, _ = comp
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        for r in range(minr, maxr + 1):
            for k in range(w):
                src_c = minc + k
                dst_c = curr_col + k
                if 0 <= dst_c < n:
                    nv = g[r][src_c]
                    if nv != bg:
                        out[r][dst_c] = nv
        curr_col += w
```
(This packing logic is key for shifting but buggy—abuts bounding boxes without preserving internal gaps, leading to squished shapes; copies only non-bg, good; right-align calc prevents overflow.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated packs right-side blocks (e.g., 2's and 1's in rows 2-6) too far left (starting ~col 15 instead of ~col 17), causing overlap/shift with left blocks; bottom right 2/6/4 blocks misaligned vertically (e.g., row 13 has extra 2's on right not in expected); row 7 has 2's in cols 12-16 in generated but expected has them in 12-16 wait no—expected row 7: 2's in 12-16, but generated row 7: 2's in 15-19? Wait, counting shows generated row 2: 2's at end, but expected shifted right; unknown why grouping split the small 2-block wrong, leading to separate packing; left blocks (with 8) packed correctly but overwrote some bg incorrectly.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Full match, so component finding, classification (has_8 left/right), blocking, and packing worked perfectly for that grid's layout—suggests core logic handles simple non-overlapping vertical stacks well.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated row 0 has 1's across left (cols 0-4,10-20) but expected has 1's only on right (cols 16-21? Wait, expected row 0: 1's cols 0-14 then 2's 16-21); row 1 generated has 8's left and 2/3's mid but expected shifts 2/3's right; overall, left-packing (with 8) correct but right-blocks (no 8) packed too leftward (e.g., 2/3 in cols 12-16 instead of 16-21), squishing against left; unknown blob merging issue as top 1's blob seems over-classified/misplaced; bottom 2/4/3 blocks shifted left by ~4-6 cols.
 * General misses: Packing doesn't preserve original horizontal spacing between components in a block (just butts bounding boxes, causing compression); grouping tolerance (+1) may merge non-adjacent if rows touch bg wrongly; no validation for component overlaps post-pack; 8-detection flags whole component but 8 cells copy as-is, which is good but may leave "eyes" in wrong relative spots if shapes irregular.
 * Function `get_background` is correct and helpful.
 * `find_components` is essential and mostly accurate (good for extraction), but may over-connect if non-bg cells of different values touch (assumes all non-bg connect—check if puzzle requires same-value connectivity? Unknown, but examples suggest it works sometimes).
 * `group_into_blocks` is helpful but the +1 adjacency may be too loose (e.g., in ex1 row 7-8 gap breaks block wrong?).
 * `pack_block` is core but broken for multi-component blocks—src_c = minc + k assumes dense bounding box, but copies g[r][src_c] which includes internal bg/holes, but if shape has gaps, it copies bg (skipped), so shapes preserve but abutment loses offsets (e.g., if two components had space between, it squishes them).
 * Overall program in `program` ties it together well but fails on complex layouts (2/3 incorrect), showing partial understanding of splitting/packing but misses subtlety in block widths/offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it packs components (e.g., top 2/4/3 blocks with 8? Wait, 8's appear mid-grid) heavily to the left/mid (e.g., row 0: 9's left, 2's cols 12-16, 9's right; but expected likely needs tighter right-packing for no-8 blocks like bottom 2/6/3), creating uneven splits and overlaps (e.g., row 6: 8/2/3 mid-right, but squished against left 9's).
 * Missing right-alignment for no-8 components (e.g., row 16: 2/6 leftish, then 8/3 mid—should be pushed to cols ~16+); 9 as bg correct, but 8's (has_e) over-packed left, distorting shapes (e.g., row 7: 8's cols 0-4 but then scattered 8/2 right).
 * Does not make sense as final puzzle—looks like partial left-shift but failed to group vertical stacks (e.g., bottom 8/3 block in rows 16-20 abutted wrong, leaving gaps); likely over-merges components (e.g., 2/3 touching via 8?), causing total_w miscalc and bad curr_col starts; to fix, ensure same-value connectivity? Or adjust packing to preserve inter-component gaps by using original relative min_c offsets instead of abutting.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Training example 1 result: ERROR - Execution error: 'out_col'

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: 'out_col'
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:53:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

[2025-10-02 20:53:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

[2025-10-02 21:21:24] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            return 5
        else:
            return 0

def get_col_start_unframed(min_c: int) -> int:

    center = min_c + 2
    if center < 11:
        return 12
    else:
        return 17
```
These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 21:21:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves generating a Python program defining a 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case, following specific puzzle rules for extraction, manipulation, or transformation of those elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive, no variations like 'Program' or 'main'), which is evaluated against inputs; without it, all results fail with an extraction error.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid inputs (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual patterns, such as blobs, holes, dividers, or keys, requiring extraction of objects (e.g., connected components, shapes) before applying rules like omission based on properties (e.g., hole count, shape matching).
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like components not spanning the full grid, mismatched blob shapes (possibly due to incorrect connectivity rules, e.g., 4-way vs. 8-way), or keys that don't stretch entirely, which could cause omissions or mismatches.
 * Outputs must match expected formats precisely (e.g., specific strings, grids, or values for each training example); partial matches or syntax errors lead to failures.
 * Consider connectivity in grids (e.g., flood-fill for objects), counting features like holes or borders, and ensuring the 'program' function handles variable grid sizes without hardcoding.
 * All attempts so far failed due to missing the core 'program' function, so future generations must prioritize boilerplate structure before logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as the code lacked even the basic 'program' function. Future attempts should include utilities like grid traversal or object extraction (e.g., a flood-fill to identify connected components), but none are available here to reuse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed identically with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating no valid code structure was produced.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no puzzle logic (e.g., object extraction, rule application) could be tested or evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the requirement to define a 'program' function, making it completely non-functional.
 * No helpful functions were included; any prior code snippets (if any) would be irrelevant without the core function.
 * This attempt is broken at the foundational level—do not reuse any generated code from it, as it contains no executable or puzzle-relevant elements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR ("Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as no actual processing or output was produced for the test input grid.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, the test case couldn't be mentally simulated or compared to expected results (e.g., correct object extraction or rule application for the specific test grid patterns).
 * It differs from expectations because a correct test output should produce a valid result (e.g., a transformed grid, string, or value matching puzzle rules), but here nothing was generated—likely the expected output involves handling unique test elements like irregular shapes or keys, which couldn't be addressed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations, likely rotations or reflections of shapes/objects within a larger grid background (filled with 0s or borders), where the goal is to apply a consistent rule to rearrange or reorient elements to match the expected output. The previous attempt used a simple horizontal flip, which failed to produce the correct rearrangements seen in the expected outputs, suggesting the transformation is more complex, such as a 90-degree rotation or targeted object manipulation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids are 22x22 (22 rows, each with 22 integers), with 0s as background/borders and non-zero numbers (1-9) representing colored shapes or objects that must be preserved in form but repositioned/oriented differently.
 * Expected outputs show shapes "migrating" across the grid: e.g., in training example 1, clusters of 8s, 5s, 3s, 2s, 1s, 9s, 6s, and 4s shift from right/center positions in generated to left/top in expected, indicating a rotational or mirroring transformation rather than simple left-right flip.
 * Subtle element: Shapes maintain their internal structure (e.g., a 3x3 block of 3s stays connected) but change orientation/position; borders (e.g., 8s or 4s) may act as frames that also transform.
 * Objects appear to be "extractable" as blobs (connected components of the same number), and the puzzle may involve rotating individual objects or the whole grid by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a center point.
 * Key consideration: Background 0s must remain 0s in the same positions post-transformation, but non-zero regions shift without overlapping or distorting.
 * Easy to miss: The transformation isn't uniform across the grid—some shapes (e.g., vertical stacks of 8s in train 1 expected) suggest partial rotations or reflections over vertical/horizontal axes, not just global flip.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), no object extraction was used, leading to wholesale grid manipulation that ignores shape boundaries.
 * Numbers 1-9 likely represent distinct "colors" or identities that must stay consistent within their blobs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided in the attempt; the flip_horizontal is basic but incorrect for this puzzle as it only reverses rows without addressing rotations or object isolation.

```python
def flip_horizontal(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flip the grid horizontally (mirror left-right)."""
    return [row[::-1] for row in g]
```
(This function is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it produces left-right mirrors that don't match expected positional shifts; avoid using it in future attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt applied a global horizontal flip to the entire grid, which reversed left-right positions of all elements (e.g., in train 1, 8s moved from left to right, but expected has them on left with vertical stacking).
 * What worked: Nothing— all three training examples failed (marked INCORRECT), as the flip preserved row order but inverted columns, while expected outputs show row-column swaps and reorientations (e.g., train 1 generated has horizontal 8s on right, expected has vertical 8s on left; train 2 generated keeps shapes in place but flipped, expected rotates upper shapes downward).
 * What didn't work: Failed to rotate or transpose the grid (e.g., train 3 generated has 8s and 6s in original orientations, expected rotates the top 8-3-2 cluster to the left side); no object detection, so connected components weren't isolated and transformed independently.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 5s and 8s horizontally aligned on right/middle, expected shifts them to left with 5s embedded vertically in 8s; 9s and 6s are flipped but not rotated (unknown why positions don't align—possibly needs 90-degree counterclockwise rotation).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated flips 4s and 8s horizontally, but expected rotates the 8-9-3 block downward and left, with 1s and 6s reoriented vertically; bottom 8-6 block is mirrored incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 2-3 and 8-6 clusters mostly horizontal and right-aligned, expected rotates them leftward (e.g., 2-3-2 becomes vertical on left); 4s and 5s are displaced wrong.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., finding connected components of same-number cells) was attempted, which is essential for handling individual shape rotations without affecting background.
 * Global flip ignores subtle border behaviors (e.g., 1s or 4s as frames in train 2/3 expected wrap differently post-rotation).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same horizontal flip as training, resulting in shapes like 8-4-3 on right flipped to left but still horizontal, and 2-6-3 clusters mirrored without rotation (e.g., top 9-border with embedded 2-4 stays row-wise reversed, bottom 8-3 with 2-6-3 is left-right inverted).
 * This does not look correct: Expected likely involves 90-degree rotation (e.g., vertical stacks of 9s on left, rotated 2-4-3 downward like in train 1), as the current output keeps horizontal orientations and doesn't match the positional migrations in training expecteds (e.g., 7s and 1s in middle should shift to top/left, but they're just flipped; unknown exact rotation direction, but flip alone fails).
 * Test output is missing rotational reorientation (e.g., the 8-7-1 block should become vertical, similar to train 3's 8-6 shift); it over-applies left-right mirroring to borders (9s), creating incorrect symmetry.
 * To handle test case, must account for new numbers (7s, possibly a new shape) by extracting and rotating blobs, ensuring no overlap with 9-background.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (likely 22x22 based on context) where the task is to detect, analyze, and regroup "components" such as frames and enclosed inner shapes based on properties like colors, bounding boxes, holes, and spatial relationships, then reposition or redraw them in a standardized output grid following specific placement rules (e.g., frames with inners in columns, standardized sizes). The goal appears to be transforming the input to match a canonical representation, preserving distinctions like frame colors (e.g., 2 and 8) and handling enclosures/holes, but the provided program fails entirely due to runtime errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined by non-zero colors; 0 is background/empty, and colors like 2 and 8 seem special as preferred frame colors, while others may be inners or frames with holes.
 * Bounding boxes must be computed accurately for each color's pixels to check spatial containment (inners strictly inside frames) and estimate holes via pixel deficits (e.g., assuming square shapes and ~9 pixels per hole, but this is a simplification that may overestimate/underestimate for non-square or irregular shapes).
 * Enclosures require strict distinction: frame color != inner colors, and inners must be fully contained within the frame's bbox without touching borders; regrouping dynamically assigns inners (hole-free) to frames, limiting to ~2 per frame, alternating frame colors (2/8), and handling large canvases (full-grid spanning components) by flattening them as solid backgrounds.
 * Placement rules emphasize standardization: use 5x5 frames for single inners (3x3 centered), larger/stacked for multiples; position in two columns (left for color 8, right for 2), starting from row 1, with vertical stacking and spacing; overwrite large backgrounds but ensure small placements fit within grid bounds (e.g., avoid index errors on 22x22 grid).
 * Subtle elements: Holes are estimated, not directly counted (may miss irregular holes); regrouping preserves color order (sort ascending) and checks distinctions per group; large components (bbox 0,0,n-1,n-1) act as backgrounds but need holes flattened to 0; potential for multiple components per color (though code assumes one bbox per color, which may merge disconnected parts incorrectly).
 * Easy-to-miss: Spatial containment is strict (<, not <=) to avoid border touching; output must handle empty inners gracefully; canvas size is fixed (n x n, likely 22); errors arise from out-of-bounds placements or undefined helpers (e.g., if grid size mismatches assumptions).
 * All considerations: Detect all colors excluding 0; handle cases with no inners/holes; sort and alternate frames to balance; for test inputs, likely involve mixed frames/inners/large backgrounds that require precise regrouping to avoid overlaps or omissions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple, Set

def get_present_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Set[int]:
    """Extracts all unique non-zero colors from the grid. Useful for identifying frames and inners."""

    n = len(g)

    for r in range(n):

                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) if min_r <= max_r else None
```

    """Estimates holes by calculating pixel deficit in the bounding box (expected solid area minus actual pixels).

    if bbox is None:
        return 0
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
    height, width = max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
    expected_solid = height * width
    actual_pixels = sum(1 for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1) for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1) if g[r][c] == color)
    deficit = expected_solid - actual_pixels
    return max(0, deficit // 9)
```

def is_spatially_contained(inner: Tuple[int, int, int, int], outer: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:

    o_min_r, o_max_r, o_min_c, o_max_c = outer
    return (o_min_r < i_min_r and i_max_r < o_max_r and o_min_c < i_min_c and i_max_c < o_max_c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to detect components via colors, bboxes, and holes, then regroup inners (hole=0) into frames (colors 2/8) with up to 2 per frame, which aligns with puzzle rules for enclosures and distinction but fails due to execution errors (likely index out-of-bounds in placement or undefined variables).
 * What worked: Core detection functions (get_present_colors, compute_bounding_box, estimate_holes) are logically sound and could extract objects accurately; spatial containment check is strict and correct for inners.
 * What didn't work: Regrouping logic mishandles components (e.g., assumes single bbox per color, clears inners_by_color prematurely, sorts all_inners but doesn't use bboxes for multiples); placement causes errors (e.g., stacking inners with idx*6 in 5x5/11x11 frames overflows grid bounds on 22x22; left/right columns at 1/17 with step=6 may exceed width; place_standard_frame draws borders but stacks inners incorrectly for n_inners>1).
 * find_contained_inners is incomplete/broken (relies on global g but doesn't fully integrate with regroup; skips seen_colors properly but assumes whole component inner without pixel checks).
 * regroup_enclosures is overcomplicated and erroneous (groups only hole=0 as inners but treats hole>0 as frames without bbox usage; alternates frames but doesn't handle large canvases in grouping).
 * place_components detects large backgrounds correctly but flattens them while overwriting, leading to potential conflicts; col starts (1/17) and row_step=6 assume 22x22 but error on smaller tests (training examples likely smaller grids, causing index errors).
 * detect_components is helpful for extracting all (color, holes, bbox) but program doesn't use it fully (calls regroup directly, skipping containment).
 * Overall, no training examples passed (all ERROR - Execution error: 1 or 2, likely IndexError or TypeError from bbox None or out-of-bounds); errors suggest unhandled edge cases like empty grids, no inners, or mismatched n.
 * Function place_standard_frame is partially helpful for drawing but broken for multiple inners (hardcoded stacking ignores actual bbox sizes); check_color_distinction is simple but correct.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: The main program() flow is flawed (chains detect -> regroup -> place without error handling); estimate_holes placeholder is too simplistic (deficit//9 assumes 3x3 holes but may count background as holes incorrectly); find_contained_inners not called in main, making it unused/irrelevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test input result is ERROR - Execution error: 2, which does not look correct (no grid output generated, indicating a runtime crash rather than a valid transformation).
 * Similar to training examples (all errors: Train1=2, Train2/3=1), suggesting the code fails universally on index bounds or None bboxes, especially if test has large components or sparse placements that trigger out-of-bounds in place_standard_frame or compute_bounding_box on non-22x22 grids.
 * Expected test output should be a regrouped grid with frames in left/right columns, solid large background if present, and centered 3x3 inners without overlaps, but errors prevent any generation—likely missing strict bounds checks (e.g., if start_row + height > n) or handling for n<22.
 * Differences from expected: No output at all vs. a structured 22x22 grid with colors 2/8 as frames enclosing sorted inners; unknown exact test grid, but errors imply it has components causing placement overflow (e.g., many frames exceeding row_step*num).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of colored integers representing shapes made of connected blocks, where the goal is to separate and rearrange "bordered" shapes (those containing the color 8, likely frames or outlines) onto the left side of a new output grid and "open" shapes (lacking 8) onto the right side, while handling background colors appropriately. The output preserves some structural aspects of the shapes but repositions them in a specific layout that combines elements from the original grid, rather than simple extraction and stacking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid, but it varies (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 8 across examples), and non-background components must be identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS on 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right) excluding background.
 * Shapes are connected components of non-background cells; single cells or small groups count as components if non-bg.
 * Classification: Bordered ('left') shapes contain at least one 8 (often as a frame around inner colors like 5,3,4); open ('right') shapes lack 8 entirely (e.g., solid blocks of 1,3,5,6,9).
 * Sorting: Components should be ordered by their topmost row (min row index) to maintain vertical sequence from the original grid.
 * Placement is not simple vertical stacking from row 0; instead, left-side shapes retain some original positional structure (e.g., bordered frames with inner shapes placed relative to their original rows, sometimes with extensions or merges), while right-side shapes are extracted and placed starting around column 17 but aligned to specific rows (not stacked contiguously—gaps or offsets occur based on original positions). Output grid is always 22x22, padded with background where needed.
 * Subtle elements: Bordered shapes on left often include the 8 frame intact, creating enclosed areas (e.g., 8 around 5's or 3's), and may overlap or extend horizontally into middle columns in the output; right shapes are "unframed" versions placed without borders, sometimes horizontally adjacent in the right panel. Gaps between shapes must match original relative spacing (not filled or stacked tightly). Background propagation: Left may use original bg or 8, right uses a consistent bg (often 0 or 2). Easy to miss: Some shapes span multiple rows/columns irregularly (not always rectangular), and output may include "divider" areas (e.g., columns 5-16 often bg or transitional). Components must ignore diagonal connections—only orthogonal. In some cases, large bg areas or full-row shapes (e.g., bottom bars of 4's) need special handling to avoid misplacement.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; shapes keep original colors. Output rows may have asymmetric lengths in description but are full 22 cols. Test input has complex nested shapes (e.g., 7 inside 8's on left, 9's as bg? on right), requiring careful component bounding without breaking frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python

(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing various numbered cells (representing colored or shaped blobs) needs to be processed by identifying connected components (non-background blobs), separating them into "left" (those containing the number 8) and "right" (those without 8) groups, vertically grouping contiguous blocks of these components by row ranges, and then reassembling them side-by-side in a new 22x22 grid: left blocks placed flush left (starting at column 0) and right blocks placed flush right (starting at column 22 - total width), while preserving the relative row positions and internal shapes of each component without rotation or scaling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components with any cell equal to 8 are "left" (even if mixed numbers); those without 8 are "right"—this is a binary split, not per-number.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" only if their row ranges overlap or are adjacent (max row of previous +1 >= min row of next); sort blocks by starting row.
 * Within each block, sort components left-to-right by their original min column, then place them contiguously in the output: for left blocks, start at col 0; for right blocks, start at col (22 - sum of widths in block), where width = maxc - minc + 1.
 * When placing, copy exact cell values from original positions, but shift horizontally to the new contiguous position; do not alter rows, and only place if the target column is within 0-21 and the source cell is non-background.
 * Subtlety: Components may overlap in columns within a block, but placement concatenates their widths without merging or overlapping in output—treat as side-by-side abutment.
 * Easy to miss: 8 can appear anywhere in a left component (not just borders); right components never have 8; background cells in output start as bg but are overwritten only by non-bg source cells.
 * Vertical gaps between blocks are preserved (empty rows in output stay bg); no vertical shifting or compression.
 * Input grids are 22x22; output must be exactly 22x22; numbers like 1-9 represent distinct "colors" or shapes to preserve exactly.
 * Potential edge cases: Single-cell components; blocks spanning full height; components with irregular shapes (not rectangles, so use min/max for bounding but copy actual cells); multiple blocks per side; zero-width or empty blocks (skip).
 * No rotation, reflection, or color changes; preserve all non-bg cells' values and positions relatively.

from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, useful for all examples; e.g., 0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]:

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if comp:
                    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
                    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
                    minr, maxr = min(rs), max(rs)
                    minc, maxc = min(cs), max(cs)
                    has8 = any(g[r][c] == 8 for r, c in comp)
                    components.append((minr, maxr, minc, maxc, has8))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes and 8-flag is core and mostly correct; it accurately detects shapes in all examples but needs integration fixes for placement.)

```python
def group_blocks(shapes: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]]:
    blocks = []
    if not shapes:
        return blocks
    # Sort by minr first (missing in provided code; add: shapes = sorted(shapes, key=lambda x: x[0]))
    current_block = [shapes[0]]
    current_maxr = shapes[0][1]
    for s in shapes[1:]:
        minr = s[0]
        if minr > current_maxr + 1:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [s]
            current_maxr = s[1]
        else:
            current_block.append(s)
            current_maxr = max(current_maxr, s[1])
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This vertical grouping logic is helpful but buggy in provided code: assumes pre-sorted input and uses has8 tuple; needs sort by minr and strip has8 for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly identifies background (0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test) and finds components with 8-flag, splitting into left/right— this works for core detection in all cases.
 * Grouping into vertical blocks works partially (e.g., train2 correct overall), but fails when components in a block have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential order, as sorting by minr is missing/incomplete.
 * Placement logic in place_block is broken: sorts by minc but then uses original minc for copying (causing misalignment); computes widths correctly but shifts incorrectly (e.g., uses minc + k for source but current + k for target without full offset); only copies if source non-bg but doesn't handle full shape copy (misses non-rectangular fills).
 * Train1 incorrect: Left blocks (with 8) placed mostly correct but right blocks shifted left too far (e.g., row2: 2's start at col12 in generated vs col17 in expected; row7: extra 2's in cols11-16; row8: 2's and 3's misplaced horizontally); bottom section (rows14-21) has 6/2/4/8 blobs concatenated wrong, with 8's on left but expected has them integrated differently—no vertical gaps preserved properly.
 * Train2 correct: All placements match expected, suggesting the logic works for simpler vertical alignments without overlaps or gaps.
 * Train3 incorrect: Top row has extra 1's and misplaced 2's (generated row0: 1's then 2's vs expected 1's then 2's but shifted); right blocks (no 8) like 3/5/4 placed too leftward (e.g., row1: 3's at col16-18 in generated vs col17-19 expected; row13: 2's at end but extra 2's in row12); left blocks with 8 correct but overall horizontal concatenation fails for multi-component blocks.
 * In all incorrect cases, right-side placement starts too early (not at 22 - total_w), causing overlap or squeeze; left flush is better but still misaligns internals.
 * Function place_block is broken/not helpful as-is: incorrect offset (uses minc in source loop, causing partial copies); doesn't copy full component cells, only bounding width slice—leads to missing parts in irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond place_block (which should be fixed, not discarded); find_components is essential and accurate for extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct), but placements are severely misaligned—e.g., top rows have 2/4/3 blobs crammed left with 9's filling right, but expected likely needs left (8-containing, like the 8/1/7/3 blobs mid-grid) flush left and right (no-8, like top 2/4/3 and bottom 6/3) flush right with gaps.
 * Specific differences: Row0: 9's then 2's starting col12 (too left; expected probably 9's full left or separated); row6: 8's at col16-20 but with 2/3 below misplaced; row16: 2/6 then 8/3/2/3 all jumbled leftward instead of split sides; bottom row21 all 9's (ok) but row20 has 8's in middle not right-flushed.
 * No vertical blocks seem grouped properly—e.g., the mid 8/1/7 block (rows7-12) should be a left block starting col0, but it's shifted right with 9's left; right blocks like bottom 2/6/3 not ending at col21.
 * Overall, doesn't match puzzle rules: Horizontal concatenation within blocks is broken (overlaps/gaps wrong), and side placement ignores flush rules—looks like partial left-placement only, ignoring right flush and block grouping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing a visual scene with a background color and various connected "components" (blobs of non-background cells, possibly representing objects like creatures or shapes). The goal is to extract these components, classify them based on whether they contain a special cell (value 8, perhaps indicating "eyes" or an entry point), group them into vertical "blocks" of overlapping or adjacent components, and repack them into a new grid by shifting left-classified blocks (with 8) to the left side and right-classified blocks (without 8) to the right side, while preserving their internal structure, vertical row positions, and horizontal tightness without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common cell value (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 or 9 in others), and all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components are bounding-boxed (min/max row/col) and flagged if they contain at least one 8 (treated as a boolean "has_e" or "has_eye"); 8 cells are part of the component but may need special handling (e.g., not erased during packing).
 * Grouping into blocks: Components are sorted by starting row (min_r), then merged into blocks if their row ranges overlap or are exactly adjacent (current max_r +1 >= next min_r); this creates horizontal "slices" of vertically coherent objects, but subtle gaps (e.g., single empty row) might break blocks incorrectly.
 * Packing: For each block, sort components by min_c (left-to-right order), compute total width, place left blocks starting at col 0 (left-aligned), right blocks starting at n - total_w (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row, col-by-col, but only non-bg cells—overwriting bg in output; preserve exact shapes, but ensure no horizontal stretching/compression beyond bounding box.
 * Subtle elements: Components may touch bg or each other without merging if different values (but code merges any non-bg, so assumes same/different values connect if adjacent—may over-merge heterogeneous blobs); 8 might be a "hole" or special marker inside components, but it's included in connectivity; vertical positions must stay exact (no row shifting); right-packing may leave gaps on left if total_w < n; in examples, some components span multiple rows/cols irregularly (e.g., L-shapes), so bounding-box copying can leave "holes" in output if not all cells are filled.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping row blocks might cause vertical stacking issues if not handled; sorting blocks by min_r ensures top-to-bottom order; in right-packing, if is_left=False, start col is max(0, n - total_w) to avoid negative indices; components without 8 go right, with 8 go left—strict binary split; no rotation/reflection, just translation; output initializes to bg everywhere.
 * Across attempts: Connectivity uses DFS/stack correctly for finding components; Counter for bg is reliable; but packing ignores relative horizontal offsets within blocks (just abuts bounding boxes), which may distort if components have internal spacing; no handling for components that touch edges or wrap; 8 detection works but may flag entire blobs wrong if 8 is bg-adjacent.

        curr_col += w
```
(This packing logic is key for shifting but buggy—abuts bounding boxes without preserving internal gaps, leading to squished shapes; copies only non-bg, good; right-align calc prevents overflow.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated packs right-side blocks (e.g., 2's and 1's in rows 2-6) too far left (starting ~col 15 instead of ~col 17), causing overlap/shift with left blocks; bottom right 2/6/4 blocks misaligned vertically (e.g., row 13 has extra 2's on right not in expected); row 7 has 2's in cols 12-16 in generated but expected has them in 12-16 wait no—expected row 7: 2's in 12-16, but generated row 7: 2's in 15-19? Wait, counting shows generated row 2: 2's at end, but expected shifted right; unknown why grouping split the small 2-block wrong, leading to separate packing; left blocks (with 8) packed correctly but overwrote some bg incorrectly.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Full match, so component finding, classification (has_8 left/right), blocking, and packing worked perfectly for that grid's layout—suggests core logic handles simple non-overlapping vertical stacks well.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated row 0 has 1's across left (cols 0-4,10-20) but expected has 1's only on right (cols 16-21? Wait, expected row 0: 1's cols 0-14 then 2's 16-21); row 1 generated has 8's left and 2/3's mid but expected shifts 2/3's right; overall, left-packing (with 8) correct but right-blocks (no 8) packed too leftward (e.g., 2/3 in cols 12-16 instead of 16-21), squishing against left; unknown blob merging issue as top 1's blob seems over-classified/misplaced; bottom 2/4/3 blocks shifted left by ~4-6 cols.
 * General misses: Packing doesn't preserve original horizontal spacing between components in a block (just butts bounding boxes, causing compression); grouping tolerance (+1) may merge non-adjacent if rows touch bg wrongly; no validation for component overlaps post-pack; 8-detection flags whole component but 8 cells copy as-is, which is good but may leave "eyes" in wrong relative spots if shapes irregular.
 * Function `get_background` is correct and helpful.
 * `find_components` is essential and mostly accurate (good for extraction), but may over-connect if non-bg cells of different values touch (assumes all non-bg connect—check if puzzle requires same-value connectivity? Unknown, but examples suggest it works sometimes).
 * `group_into_blocks` is helpful but the +1 adjacency may be too loose (e.g., in ex1 row 7-8 gap breaks block wrong?).
 * `pack_block` is core but broken for multi-component blocks—src_c = minc + k assumes dense bounding box, but copies g[r][src_c] which includes internal bg/holes, but if shape has gaps, it copies bg (skipped), so shapes preserve but abutment loses offsets (e.g., if two components had space between, it squishes them).
 * Overall program in `program` ties it together well but fails on complex layouts (2/3 incorrect), showing partial understanding of splitting/packing but misses subtlety in block widths/offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it packs components (e.g., top 2/4/3 blocks with 8? Wait, 8's appear mid-grid) heavily to the left/mid (e.g., row 0: 9's left, 2's cols 12-16, 9's right; but expected likely needs tighter right-packing for no-8 blocks like bottom 2/6/3), creating uneven splits and overlaps (e.g., row 6: 8/2/3 mid-right, but squished against left 9's).
 * Missing right-alignment for no-8 components (e.g., row 16: 2/6 leftish, then 8/3 mid—should be pushed to cols ~16+); 9 as bg correct, but 8's (has_e) over-packed left, distorting shapes (e.g., row 7: 8's cols 0-4 but then scattered 8/2 right).
 * Does not make sense as final puzzle—looks like partial left-shift but failed to group vertical stacks (e.g., bottom 8/3 block in rows 16-20 abutted wrong, leaving gaps); likely over-merges components (e.g., 2/3 touching via 8?), causing total_w miscalc and bad curr_col starts; to fix, ensure same-value connectivity? Or adjust packing to preserve inter-component gaps by using original relative min_c offsets instead of abutting.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited_temp and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited_temp.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```

```python
def get_col_start_framed(min_r: int, min_c: int) -> int:
    """Column start for framed objects: row-dependent with col check."""
    if min_r >= 10:
        return 0
    else:
        if min_c >= 12:
            return 5
        else:
            return 0

def get_col_start_unframed(min_c: int) -> int:
    """Column start for unframed: based on centered min_col."""
    center = min_c + 2
    if center < 11:
        return 12
    else:
        return 17
```
These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 21:35:10] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Set, Dict, Tuple

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    bg = Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    left_shapes: List[Dict] = []
    
    # Extract left shapes: flood from 8 cells, including all non-bg
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(n):

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 21:36:56] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid by identifying background (most common value), extracting connected "shapes" (non-background components) separately for left and right sides—left starting from cells marked 8 and flooding to all non-background, right starting from cells marked 2 and flooding to non-background excluding 8—and then regrouping these shapes into vertical "blocks" based on row overlap, compressing them horizontally by their bounding boxes, and placing left blocks aligned to the left edge and right blocks aligned to the right edge of a new output grid, while preserving vertical positions and overwriting background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common value in the flattened grid; everything else is part of shapes, but shapes must be extracted via flood fill from specific seeds (8 for left, 2 for right) to separate left/right components—do not assume all non-bg are shapes without seeding.
 * Flood fill uses 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right); shapes are sets of cells with their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for later placement.
 * Left extraction: Start from unvisited 8 cells, flood to any adjacent non-bg (this can accidentally include right shapes if they connect via non-bg paths to 8's, which seems to happen in some cases).
 * Right extraction: Start from unvisited 2 cells after left extraction (using shared visited set), flood only to non-bg and non-8; this excludes left shapes but may miss isolated right shapes if they don't start from 2 or if visited by left flood.
 * Grouping: Sort shapes by min row, then cluster into "blocks" where shapes overlap in row range (min_r of next <= max_r of current); within each block, sort by min col and place sequentially without gaps, shifting entire shapes horizontally to pack tightly.
 * Placement: Output starts as all bg; for left blocks, start at col 0 and add shape widths sequentially; for right blocks, start at col (n - total_block_width) and add leftward; rows stay absolute (no vertical shift); only place if new_col in bounds, but this can clip shapes.
 * Subtleties: Shared visited set prevents re-flooding, but left flood's broad condition (!= bg) can overgrab if components touch; right flood's exclusion of 8 prevents left overlap but may fragment shapes containing 2's near 8's. Bg may vary (0,1,9 across examples). Grids are square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). No diagonal connectivity. Shapes with only bg or empty after flood are skipped. Horizontal compression assumes no overlaps in block, but vertical stacking of blocks is implicit via per-block processing. Easy to miss: right shapes may include numbers like 1,3,4,5,6,9 if connected to 2; left includes 3,4,5,6 but not 2's directly. If a 2 is connected to 8 via non-bg, it gets grabbed as left, causing misalignment (seen in examples).
 * All non-seed cells (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,9) are treated as shape pixels with their original values; do not change values during extraction/placement.
 * Potential edge cases: Shapes spanning full width (no compression needed); isolated shapes; blocks with single shape; right shapes with varying widths; bg=0/1/9; grids where left/right touch via bg only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg, uses flood fill for shape extraction, groups into row-overlapping blocks, and performs horizontal compression/placement separately for left/right, which works fully for training example 2 (exact match, preserving all shapes like 3's,5's,6's in correct positions).
 * What worked: Shared visited prevents double-extraction; seeding from 8/2 separates sides; bounding box calculation enables compression; vertical positions preserved; one training example passes completely, showing core extraction/placement logic is sound when shapes are cleanly separated.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1 (INCORRECT), left flood overgrabs right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-4 shapes placed on left instead of right, like row 13 generated has 2's starting at col 2 on left vs. expected all 0's until col 12 with 2's on right; row 16 generated has 2-2-2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-6-6-6-2 on right with 4's shifted; row 17 generated has 2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-2-2-2-2-2-4-4-4-2; unknown if due to connection via non-bg path to 8, but it misplaces entire blocks).
 * In training example 1, upper parts match (e.g., 5's,3's,1's on right correct), but lower right 9's and 6's/4's are fragmented or shifted leftward, and row 13 has extra 2's on left not in expected (expected has uniform 2's on right).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), left shapes (8-2-3-6) are placed correctly in middle-left, but right shapes are underplaced or overwritten: e.g., row 0 generated all 1's (bg) vs. expected 2's on right (missing top 2-3-4 block); row 1 generated has 2-3-3-3-2 on left-middle vs. expected on right; row 16 generated 2-2-2-2-2 on right but 3's misplaced left; overall, right blocks start too far left (e.g., total_width miscalculated, placing at col ~10 instead of n-5).
 * extract_objects via flood_fill is essential and mostly correct, but left flood condition (!= bg) is too broad (should perhaps exclude 2's or use stricter connectivity to prevent bleed); right flood (!= bg and !=8) is better but fails if 2's are visited by left.
 * The group_and_place function is helpful for blocking/packing but buggy in right-side base_col calculation (uses n - total_width, but if blocks have varying widths or overlaps, it packs left-to-right within right block, causing leftward shift into center).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (Counter for bg, flood, group, place) are relevant, though flood needs tuning for separation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules and patterns from training examples; it follows the same logic (bg=9, left from 8 including 1/7, right from 2 including 3/4/6), but shows similar issues as incorrect trainings: e.g., upper right 2-4-3 shapes are placed correctly compressed on right (rows 1-5 match expected pattern of packing 4's then 3's), but lower left 8-1-7 placed on left ok, yet row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 on left-middle then 2-3-3-3-2 on right (suggests overgrab of a 2-6 shape into left block, like ex1); row 17 has 2-2-2-2-2 on left then 8-3-3-3-8-2-3-3-3-2, with 3's split across center (expected likely packs right block tighter to right edge without left bleed); row 8 has isolated 8-1-1-1-8 on left but 7's below shifted, and right all 9's (missing any right shapes there?); overall, compression works for isolated blocks but shared visited + broad left flood causes right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-3) to fragment or misalign leftward, not fully right-justified as in correct ex2—does not match clean separation expected, likely needs stricter flood conditions to handle test's denser connections (e.g., 2's near 8's in rows 15-20).

[2025-10-02 21:36:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:05:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The code must define a specific 'program' function to be valid, suggesting the puzzle evaluates functional code that implements puzzle-solving logic, such as extracting or manipulating elements in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, indicating this is a strict requirement for code validation.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid representations (e.g., List[List[int]]) where cells represent visual features like filled/empty spaces, objects, holes, or patterns that need to be analyzed or transformed.
 * Training examples (1-3) and test input must all pass independently, so the code needs to handle variations in grid size, object placement, or puzzle rules without hardcoding.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may contain multiple objects or blobs that require extraction (e.g., connected components), counting features like holes or edges, and applying rules like omission based on criteria; mismatches could arise from incorrect connectivity assumptions (e.g., 4-connected vs. 8-connected) or boundary handling.
 * Considerations across attempts: No successful processing occurred, so focus on basic structure first; ensure the 'program' function takes expected inputs (e.g., grid) and returns outputs matching puzzle expectations (e.g., a processed grid, count, or string description); avoid generating incomplete or non-executable code.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Future attempts should include basics like grid parsing.

```python
# Example of a potentially useful type for grid elements (not from previous attempt)
class GridObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (x,y) coords
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a potentially useful extraction function (not from previous attempt; include in future for object detection)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[GridObject]:
    # Placeholder: Use flood fill or DFS to find connected components where grid[i][j] > 0
    objects = []
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in grid]
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                # Simulate flood fill to get positions and count holes (enclosed zeros)
                positions = []  # Collect during DFS
                hole_count = 0  # Count internal zeros
                # DFS implementation here
                objects.append(GridObject(positions, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (training examples 1-3 and test) failed completely due to the generated code not containing the required 'program' function, resulting in identical error messages.
 * Nothing worked: No code execution or output generation occurred, showing a fundamental structural issue rather than logic errors.
 * No helpful functions were produced; any code generated was invalid and non-executable for the puzzle's evaluator.
 * The extract_objects function is not present but would be essential for identifying visual elements like blobs or objects in future attempts; without it, puzzles involving object detection can't be solved.
 * Unhelpful/ broken: The entire previous code is broken and irrelevant since it doesn't define 'program'—do not reuse or build on it; start from scratch with proper structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct because it indicates total failure to produce valid code, rather than any puzzle-specific result.
 * No actual processing of the test input grid occurred, so it can't match expected outputs (e.g., a transformed grid, object summary, or rule-applied result); this is different from expectations as the puzzle requires functional code that mentally simulates to a correct solution like identifying patterns or counts.
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the test output is uniformly incorrect and unhelpful for debugging puzzle rules.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 22:05:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-10-02 22:15:41] Response:
```python
from typing import List

def rotate90_clockwise(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [[g[n - 1 - j][i] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return rotate90_clockwise(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:16:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids where numbers (1-9) represent distinct colored or shaped regions (blobs/objects) separated by 0s (background), and the goal is to apply a transformation—likely a specific rotation, mirroring, or rearrangement of these blobs—to match the expected output layout while preserving their internal structures and relative positions in a rule-based way.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are consistently 22x22, with blobs of the same number forming connected regions (e.g., 2s form a shape, 3s fill an inner part); transformations must maintain blob connectivity, size, and internal patterns but reposition them.
 * Expected outputs rearrange blobs into new configurations, often appearing as a mirrored or rotated composition of the input, but not a simple whole-grid rotation—individual blobs seem to be extracted, transformed (e.g., rotated or flipped), and recomposed.
 * Subtle element: Blobs have "fillings" or substructures (e.g., a 2-blob containing 1s, 3s, etc.), which must be preserved relative to the outer blob; backgrounds (0s) must fill all non-blob areas exactly.
 * Rotations or mirrors might be per-blob or grouped (e.g., by color adjacency), and the overall composition often inverts top-bottom or left-right orientations compared to naive rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Some blobs overlap or nest (e.g., 8 surrounding 5s in training 1), so extraction must handle hierarchies; also, some rows/columns are all-0s in expected outputs, indicating compression or shifting.
 * Across attempts: No object extraction was done, leading to wholesale grid transforms that scramble blob positions incorrectly; need to identify connected components (blobs) via flood-fill or similar to transform them independently.
 * Consider edge cases like isolated blobs (e.g., all-1s rows in training 3) or symmetric shapes that might not change under rotation but do under mirroring.
 * Outputs preserve the set of numbers used but reposition them; count of each number must match input to expected (e.g., same number of 5s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rotate90_clockwise(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [[g[n - 1 - j][i] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
```
(This function correctly implements 90-degree clockwise rotation for a square grid but is not sufficient alone, as the puzzle requires more than whole-grid rotation—useful as a building block for per-blob transforms.)

```python
# Potential helpful function (not implemented in attempt but suggested for future: extract connected blobs)
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[List[int]]]]:
    # Use flood-fill to find connected components of non-zero numbers, returning (color, blob_grid) pairs.
    # This would allow isolating and transforming each blob separately before recomposing.
    # Broken/unimplemented in current attempt; essential for handling individual shapes.
    pass
```
(No other functions were provided; simple grid printing or comparison tools would help verify blob counts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation on the entire grid, which preserved overall structure but incorrectly repositioned all blobs as a unit, leading to mismatches in blob locations and orientations across all training examples.
 * What worked: The rotation function is mathematically correct and handles square grids without distortion; it correctly transforms coordinates (e.g., top-left becomes top-right).
 * What didn't work: Failed to identify or isolate individual blobs, resulting in scrambled compositions—e.g., in training 1, generated has 2-blob and 6-blob rotated into wrong quadrant, while expected repositions 8-blob to top-left and nests 5s/3s differently; similar issues in training 2 (4-blobs and 8-blobs misaligned) and training 3 (1-background and 8/2 blobs flipped incorrectly).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated places 8-blob at bottom-left with 5s inside but expected has it at top-left with 5s/3s nested differently; 2-blob with 1s is rotated to bottom but expected shifts it rightward; unknown why 6-blob appears fragmented in generated vs. intact in expected.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated rotates 4-background and 8/3 blobs clockwise, placing 1-blob mid-left but expected mirrors or shifts 8/1 to bottom and 2/5 to top-right; 6-blob is in wrong position (mid vs. bottom).
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated rotates 1-background minimally but scatters 8/3 and 2/5 blobs incorrectly (e.g., 5s inside 2 but positioned left vs. expected right/nested); 6-blob rotated to mid but expected has it centered under 8.
 * No object extraction was attempted, so all transforms treated the grid holistically— this is essential and missing; the rotate function alone is insufficient and not tailored to puzzle rules.
 * All training examples failed completely (INCORRECT), indicating no core understanding of blob-based transforms.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input, which does not look correct—it repositions the large 9-background to the right/side and scatters 2/3/1/4/6/7/8 blobs awkwardly (e.g., 2-blob with 4s rotated to bottom-right, 8-blob with 3s to mid-left), but the puzzle likely requires a different transform like counter-clockwise rotation, mirroring, or per-blob handling to match an expected recomposition.
 * It fails to preserve nested structures properly (e.g., 3s inside 2-blob are rotated but may not align with expected nesting); the overall layout looks like a rotated jumble rather than an intentional puzzle solution, with 9s dominating the left but expected probably shifts blobs to form symmetric or rule-based patterns.
 * Does not account for potential mirroring (e.g., input's top 9s and bottom 8/4 might flip vertically in expected); blob counts seem preserved but positions are wrong, suggesting the output is invalid for the puzzle rules.
 * Looks incorrect because it doesn't resemble the expected patterns in training (e.g., no top-heavy blob clustering as in training 1's expected); without expected test output, it's clear from training failures that rotation alone won't work here.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 22:16:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves generating a Python program defining a 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case, following specific puzzle rules for extraction, manipulation, or transformation of those elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive, no variations like 'Program' or 'main'), which is evaluated against inputs; without it, all results fail with an extraction error.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid inputs (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual patterns, such as blobs, holes, dividers, or keys, requiring extraction of objects (e.g., connected components, shapes) before applying rules like omission based on properties (e.g., hole count, shape matching).
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like components not spanning the full grid, mismatched blob shapes (possibly due to incorrect connectivity rules, e.g., 4-way vs. 8-way), or keys that don't stretch entirely, which could cause omissions or mismatches.
 * Outputs must match expected formats precisely (e.g., specific strings, grids, or values for each training example); partial matches or syntax errors lead to failures.
 * Consider connectivity in grids (e.g., flood-fill for objects), counting features like holes or borders, and ensuring the 'program' function handles variable grid sizes without hardcoding.
 * All attempts so far failed due to missing the core 'program' function, so future generations must prioritize boilerplate structure before logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as the code lacked even the basic 'program' function. Future attempts should include utilities like grid traversal or object extraction (e.g., a flood-fill to identify connected components), but none are available here to reuse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed identically with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating no valid code structure was produced.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no puzzle logic (e.g., object extraction, rule application) could be tested or evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the requirement to define a 'program' function, making it completely non-functional.
 * No helpful functions were included; any prior code snippets (if any) would be irrelevant without the core function.
 * This attempt is broken at the foundational level—do not reuse any generated code from it, as it contains no executable or puzzle-relevant elements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR ("Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as no actual processing or output was produced for the test input grid.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, the test case couldn't be mentally simulated or compared to expected results (e.g., correct object extraction or rule application for the specific test grid patterns).
 * It differs from expectations because a correct test output should produce a valid result (e.g., a transformed grid, string, or value matching puzzle rules), but here nothing was generated—likely the expected output involves handling unique test elements like irregular shapes or keys, which couldn't be addressed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The code must define a specific 'program' function to be valid, suggesting the puzzle evaluates functional code that implements puzzle-solving logic, such as extracting or manipulating elements in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, indicating this is a strict requirement for code validation.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid representations (e.g., List[List[int]]) where cells represent visual features like filled/empty spaces, objects, holes, or patterns that need to be analyzed or transformed.
 * Training examples (1-3) and test input must all pass independently, so the code needs to handle variations in grid size, object placement, or puzzle rules without hardcoding.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may contain multiple objects or blobs that require extraction (e.g., connected components), counting features like holes or edges, and applying rules like omission based on criteria; mismatches could arise from incorrect connectivity assumptions (e.g., 4-connected vs. 8-connected) or boundary handling.
 * Considerations across attempts: No successful processing occurred, so focus on basic structure first; ensure the 'program' function takes expected inputs (e.g., grid) and returns outputs matching puzzle expectations (e.g., a processed grid, count, or string description); avoid generating incomplete or non-executable code.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Future attempts should include basics like grid parsing.

```python
# Example of a potentially useful type for grid elements (not from previous attempt)
class GridObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (x,y) coords
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a potentially useful extraction function (not from previous attempt; include in future for object detection)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[GridObject]:
    # Placeholder: Use flood fill or DFS to find connected components where grid[i][j] > 0
    objects = []
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in grid]
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                # Simulate flood fill to get positions and count holes (enclosed zeros)
                positions = []  # Collect during DFS
                hole_count = 0  # Count internal zeros
                # DFS implementation here
                objects.append(GridObject(positions, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (training examples 1-3 and test) failed completely due to the generated code not containing the required 'program' function, resulting in identical error messages.
 * Nothing worked: No code execution or output generation occurred, showing a fundamental structural issue rather than logic errors.
 * No helpful functions were produced; any code generated was invalid and non-executable for the puzzle's evaluator.
 * The extract_objects function is not present but would be essential for identifying visual elements like blobs or objects in future attempts; without it, puzzles involving object detection can't be solved.
 * Unhelpful/ broken: The entire previous code is broken and irrelevant since it doesn't define 'program'—do not reuse or build on it; start from scratch with proper structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct because it indicates total failure to produce valid code, rather than any puzzle-specific result.
 * No actual processing of the test input grid occurred, so it can't match expected outputs (e.g., a transformed grid, object summary, or rule-applied result); this is different from expectations as the puzzle requires functional code that mentally simulates to a correct solution like identifying patterns or counts.
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the test output is uniformly incorrect and unhelpful for debugging puzzle rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations, likely rotations or reflections of shapes/objects within a larger grid background (filled with 0s or borders), where the goal is to apply a consistent rule to rearrange or reorient elements to match the expected output. The previous attempt used a simple horizontal flip, which failed to produce the correct rearrangements seen in the expected outputs, suggesting the transformation is more complex, such as a 90-degree rotation or targeted object manipulation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids are 22x22 (22 rows, each with 22 integers), with 0s as background/borders and non-zero numbers (1-9) representing colored shapes or objects that must be preserved in form but repositioned/oriented differently.
 * Expected outputs show shapes "migrating" across the grid: e.g., in training example 1, clusters of 8s, 5s, 3s, 2s, 1s, 9s, 6s, and 4s shift from right/center positions in generated to left/top in expected, indicating a rotational or mirroring transformation rather than simple left-right flip.
 * Subtle element: Shapes maintain their internal structure (e.g., a 3x3 block of 3s stays connected) but change orientation/position; borders (e.g., 8s or 4s) may act as frames that also transform.
 * Objects appear to be "extractable" as blobs (connected components of the same number), and the puzzle may involve rotating individual objects or the whole grid by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a center point.
 * Key consideration: Background 0s must remain 0s in the same positions post-transformation, but non-zero regions shift without overlapping or distorting.
 * Easy to miss: The transformation isn't uniform across the grid—some shapes (e.g., vertical stacks of 8s in train 1 expected) suggest partial rotations or reflections over vertical/horizontal axes, not just global flip.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), no object extraction was used, leading to wholesale grid manipulation that ignores shape boundaries.
 * Numbers 1-9 likely represent distinct "colors" or identities that must stay consistent within their blobs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided in the attempt; the flip_horizontal is basic but incorrect for this puzzle as it only reverses rows without addressing rotations or object isolation.

```python
def flip_horizontal(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flip the grid horizontally (mirror left-right)."""
    return [row[::-1] for row in g]
```
(This function is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it produces left-right mirrors that don't match expected positional shifts; avoid using it in future attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt applied a global horizontal flip to the entire grid, which reversed left-right positions of all elements (e.g., in train 1, 8s moved from left to right, but expected has them on left with vertical stacking).
 * What worked: Nothing— all three training examples failed (marked INCORRECT), as the flip preserved row order but inverted columns, while expected outputs show row-column swaps and reorientations (e.g., train 1 generated has horizontal 8s on right, expected has vertical 8s on left; train 2 generated keeps shapes in place but flipped, expected rotates upper shapes downward).
 * What didn't work: Failed to rotate or transpose the grid (e.g., train 3 generated has 8s and 6s in original orientations, expected rotates the top 8-3-2 cluster to the left side); no object detection, so connected components weren't isolated and transformed independently.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 5s and 8s horizontally aligned on right/middle, expected shifts them to left with 5s embedded vertically in 8s; 9s and 6s are flipped but not rotated (unknown why positions don't align—possibly needs 90-degree counterclockwise rotation).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated flips 4s and 8s horizontally, but expected rotates the 8-9-3 block downward and left, with 1s and 6s reoriented vertically; bottom 8-6 block is mirrored incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 2-3 and 8-6 clusters mostly horizontal and right-aligned, expected rotates them leftward (e.g., 2-3-2 becomes vertical on left); 4s and 5s are displaced wrong.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., finding connected components of same-number cells) was attempted, which is essential for handling individual shape rotations without affecting background.
 * Global flip ignores subtle border behaviors (e.g., 1s or 4s as frames in train 2/3 expected wrap differently post-rotation).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same horizontal flip as training, resulting in shapes like 8-4-3 on right flipped to left but still horizontal, and 2-6-3 clusters mirrored without rotation (e.g., top 9-border with embedded 2-4 stays row-wise reversed, bottom 8-3 with 2-6-3 is left-right inverted).
 * This does not look correct: Expected likely involves 90-degree rotation (e.g., vertical stacks of 9s on left, rotated 2-4-3 downward like in train 1), as the current output keeps horizontal orientations and doesn't match the positional migrations in training expecteds (e.g., 7s and 1s in middle should shift to top/left, but they're just flipped; unknown exact rotation direction, but flip alone fails).
 * Test output is missing rotational reorientation (e.g., the 8-7-1 block should become vertical, similar to train 3's 8-6 shift); it over-applies left-right mirroring to borders (9s), creating incorrect symmetry.
 * To handle test case, must account for new numbers (7s, possibly a new shape) by extracting and rotating blobs, ensuring no overlap with 9-background.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids where numbers (1-9) represent distinct colored or shaped regions (blobs/objects) separated by 0s (background), and the goal is to apply a transformation—likely a specific rotation, mirroring, or rearrangement of these blobs—to match the expected output layout while preserving their internal structures and relative positions in a rule-based way.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are consistently 22x22, with blobs of the same number forming connected regions (e.g., 2s form a shape, 3s fill an inner part); transformations must maintain blob connectivity, size, and internal patterns but reposition them.
 * Expected outputs rearrange blobs into new configurations, often appearing as a mirrored or rotated composition of the input, but not a simple whole-grid rotation—individual blobs seem to be extracted, transformed (e.g., rotated or flipped), and recomposed.
 * Subtle element: Blobs have "fillings" or substructures (e.g., a 2-blob containing 1s, 3s, etc.), which must be preserved relative to the outer blob; backgrounds (0s) must fill all non-blob areas exactly.
 * Rotations or mirrors might be per-blob or grouped (e.g., by color adjacency), and the overall composition often inverts top-bottom or left-right orientations compared to naive rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Some blobs overlap or nest (e.g., 8 surrounding 5s in training 1), so extraction must handle hierarchies; also, some rows/columns are all-0s in expected outputs, indicating compression or shifting.
 * Across attempts: No object extraction was done, leading to wholesale grid transforms that scramble blob positions incorrectly; need to identify connected components (blobs) via flood-fill or similar to transform them independently.
 * Consider edge cases like isolated blobs (e.g., all-1s rows in training 3) or symmetric shapes that might not change under rotation but do under mirroring.
 * Outputs preserve the set of numbers used but reposition them; count of each number must match input to expected (e.g., same number of 5s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rotate90_clockwise(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [[g[n - 1 - j][i] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
```
(This function correctly implements 90-degree clockwise rotation for a square grid but is not sufficient alone, as the puzzle requires more than whole-grid rotation—useful as a building block for per-blob transforms.)

```python
# Potential helpful function (not implemented in attempt but suggested for future: extract connected blobs)
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[List[int]]]]:
    # Use flood-fill to find connected components of non-zero numbers, returning (color, blob_grid) pairs.
    # This would allow isolating and transforming each blob separately before recomposing.
    # Broken/unimplemented in current attempt; essential for handling individual shapes.
    pass
```
(No other functions were provided; simple grid printing or comparison tools would help verify blob counts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation on the entire grid, which preserved overall structure but incorrectly repositioned all blobs as a unit, leading to mismatches in blob locations and orientations across all training examples.
 * What worked: The rotation function is mathematically correct and handles square grids without distortion; it correctly transforms coordinates (e.g., top-left becomes top-right).
 * What didn't work: Failed to identify or isolate individual blobs, resulting in scrambled compositions—e.g., in training 1, generated has 2-blob and 6-blob rotated into wrong quadrant, while expected repositions 8-blob to top-left and nests 5s/3s differently; similar issues in training 2 (4-blobs and 8-blobs misaligned) and training 3 (1-background and 8/2 blobs flipped incorrectly).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated places 8-blob at bottom-left with 5s inside but expected has it at top-left with 5s/3s nested differently; 2-blob with 1s is rotated to bottom but expected shifts it rightward; unknown why 6-blob appears fragmented in generated vs. intact in expected.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated rotates 4-background and 8/3 blobs clockwise, placing 1-blob mid-left but expected mirrors or shifts 8/1 to bottom and 2/5 to top-right; 6-blob is in wrong position (mid vs. bottom).
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated rotates 1-background minimally but scatters 8/3 and 2/5 blobs incorrectly (e.g., 5s inside 2 but positioned left vs. expected right/nested); 6-blob rotated to mid but expected has it centered under 8.
 * No object extraction was attempted, so all transforms treated the grid holistically— this is essential and missing; the rotate function alone is insufficient and not tailored to puzzle rules.
 * All training examples failed completely (INCORRECT), indicating no core understanding of blob-based transforms.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input, which does not look correct—it repositions the large 9-background to the right/side and scatters 2/3/1/4/6/7/8 blobs awkwardly (e.g., 2-blob with 4s rotated to bottom-right, 8-blob with 3s to mid-left), but the puzzle likely requires a different transform like counter-clockwise rotation, mirroring, or per-blob handling to match an expected recomposition.
 * It fails to preserve nested structures properly (e.g., 3s inside 2-blob are rotated but may not align with expected nesting); the overall layout looks like a rotated jumble rather than an intentional puzzle solution, with 9s dominating the left but expected probably shifts blobs to form symmetric or rule-based patterns.
 * Does not account for potential mirroring (e.g., input's top 9s and bottom 8/4 might flip vertically in expected); blob counts seem preserved but positions are wrong, suggesting the output is invalid for the puzzle rules.
 * Looks incorrect because it doesn't resemble the expected patterns in training (e.g., no top-heavy blob clustering as in training 1's expected); without expected test output, it's clear from training failures that rotation alone won't work here.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (likely 22x22 based on context) where the task is to detect, analyze, and regroup "components" such as frames and enclosed inner shapes based on properties like colors, bounding boxes, holes, and spatial relationships, then reposition or redraw them in a standardized output grid following specific placement rules (e.g., frames with inners in columns, standardized sizes). The goal appears to be transforming the input to match a canonical representation, preserving distinctions like frame colors (e.g., 2 and 8) and handling enclosures/holes, but the provided program fails entirely due to runtime errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined by non-zero colors; 0 is background/empty, and colors like 2 and 8 seem special as preferred frame colors, while others may be inners or frames with holes.
 * Bounding boxes must be computed accurately for each color's pixels to check spatial containment (inners strictly inside frames) and estimate holes via pixel deficits (e.g., assuming square shapes and ~9 pixels per hole, but this is a simplification that may overestimate/underestimate for non-square or irregular shapes).
 * Enclosures require strict distinction: frame color != inner colors, and inners must be fully contained within the frame's bbox without touching borders; regrouping dynamically assigns inners (hole-free) to frames, limiting to ~2 per frame, alternating frame colors (2/8), and handling large canvases (full-grid spanning components) by flattening them as solid backgrounds.
 * Placement rules emphasize standardization: use 5x5 frames for single inners (3x3 centered), larger/stacked for multiples; position in two columns (left for color 8, right for 2), starting from row 1, with vertical stacking and spacing; overwrite large backgrounds but ensure small placements fit within grid bounds (e.g., avoid index errors on 22x22 grid).
 * Subtle elements: Holes are estimated, not directly counted (may miss irregular holes); regrouping preserves color order (sort ascending) and checks distinctions per group; large components (bbox 0,0,n-1,n-1) act as backgrounds but need holes flattened to 0; potential for multiple components per color (though code assumes one bbox per color, which may merge disconnected parts incorrectly).
 * Easy-to-miss: Spatial containment is strict (<, not <=) to avoid border touching; output must handle empty inners gracefully; canvas size is fixed (n x n, likely 22); errors arise from out-of-bounds placements or undefined helpers (e.g., if grid size mismatches assumptions).
 * All considerations: Detect all colors excluding 0; handle cases with no inners/holes; sort and alternate frames to balance; for test inputs, likely involve mixed frames/inners/large backgrounds that require precise regrouping to avoid overlaps or omissions.

    return (o_min_r < i_min_r and i_max_r < o_max_r and o_min_c < i_min_c and i_max_c < o_max_c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to detect components via colors, bboxes, and holes, then regroup inners (hole=0) into frames (colors 2/8) with up to 2 per frame, which aligns with puzzle rules for enclosures and distinction but fails due to execution errors (likely index out-of-bounds in placement or undefined variables).
 * What worked: Core detection functions (get_present_colors, compute_bounding_box, estimate_holes) are logically sound and could extract objects accurately; spatial containment check is strict and correct for inners.
 * What didn't work: Regrouping logic mishandles components (e.g., assumes single bbox per color, clears inners_by_color prematurely, sorts all_inners but doesn't use bboxes for multiples); placement causes errors (e.g., stacking inners with idx*6 in 5x5/11x11 frames overflows grid bounds on 22x22; left/right columns at 1/17 with step=6 may exceed width; place_standard_frame draws borders but stacks inners incorrectly for n_inners>1).
 * find_contained_inners is incomplete/broken (relies on global g but doesn't fully integrate with regroup; skips seen_colors properly but assumes whole component inner without pixel checks).
 * regroup_enclosures is overcomplicated and erroneous (groups only hole=0 as inners but treats hole>0 as frames without bbox usage; alternates frames but doesn't handle large canvases in grouping).
 * place_components detects large backgrounds correctly but flattens them while overwriting, leading to potential conflicts; col starts (1/17) and row_step=6 assume 22x22 but error on smaller tests (training examples likely smaller grids, causing index errors).
 * detect_components is helpful for extracting all (color, holes, bbox) but program doesn't use it fully (calls regroup directly, skipping containment).
 * Overall, no training examples passed (all ERROR - Execution error: 1 or 2, likely IndexError or TypeError from bbox None or out-of-bounds); errors suggest unhandled edge cases like empty grids, no inners, or mismatched n.
 * Function place_standard_frame is partially helpful for drawing but broken for multiple inners (hardcoded stacking ignores actual bbox sizes); check_color_distinction is simple but correct.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: The main program() flow is flawed (chains detect -> regroup -> place without error handling); estimate_holes placeholder is too simplistic (deficit//9 assumes 3x3 holes but may count background as holes incorrectly); find_contained_inners not called in main, making it unused/irrelevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test input result is ERROR - Execution error: 2, which does not look correct (no grid output generated, indicating a runtime crash rather than a valid transformation).
 * Similar to training examples (all errors: Train1=2, Train2/3=1), suggesting the code fails universally on index bounds or None bboxes, especially if test has large components or sparse placements that trigger out-of-bounds in place_standard_frame or compute_bounding_box on non-22x22 grids.
 * Expected test output should be a regrouped grid with frames in left/right columns, solid large background if present, and centered 3x3 inners without overlaps, but errors prevent any generation—likely missing strict bounds checks (e.g., if start_row + height > n) or handling for n<22.
 * Differences from expected: No output at all vs. a structured 22x22 grid with colors 2/8 as frames enclosing sorted inners; unknown exact test grid, but errors imply it has components causing placement overflow (e.g., many frames exceeding row_step*num).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of colored integers representing shapes made of connected blocks, where the goal is to separate and rearrange "bordered" shapes (those containing the color 8, likely frames or outlines) onto the left side of a new output grid and "open" shapes (lacking 8) onto the right side, while handling background colors appropriately. The output preserves some structural aspects of the shapes but repositions them in a specific layout that combines elements from the original grid, rather than simple extraction and stacking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid, but it varies (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 8 across examples), and non-background components must be identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS on 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right) excluding background.
 * Shapes are connected components of non-background cells; single cells or small groups count as components if non-bg.
 * Classification: Bordered ('left') shapes contain at least one 8 (often as a frame around inner colors like 5,3,4); open ('right') shapes lack 8 entirely (e.g., solid blocks of 1,3,5,6,9).
 * Sorting: Components should be ordered by their topmost row (min row index) to maintain vertical sequence from the original grid.
 * Placement is not simple vertical stacking from row 0; instead, left-side shapes retain some original positional structure (e.g., bordered frames with inner shapes placed relative to their original rows, sometimes with extensions or merges), while right-side shapes are extracted and placed starting around column 17 but aligned to specific rows (not stacked contiguously—gaps or offsets occur based on original positions). Output grid is always 22x22, padded with background where needed.
 * Subtle elements: Bordered shapes on left often include the 8 frame intact, creating enclosed areas (e.g., 8 around 5's or 3's), and may overlap or extend horizontally into middle columns in the output; right shapes are "unframed" versions placed without borders, sometimes horizontally adjacent in the right panel. Gaps between shapes must match original relative spacing (not filled or stacked tightly). Background propagation: Left may use original bg or 8, right uses a consistent bg (often 0 or 2). Easy to miss: Some shapes span multiple rows/columns irregularly (not always rectangular), and output may include "divider" areas (e.g., columns 5-16 often bg or transitional). Components must ignore diagonal connections—only orthogonal. In some cases, large bg areas or full-row shapes (e.g., bottom bars of 4's) need special handling to avoid misplacement.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; shapes keep original colors. Output rows may have asymmetric lengths in description but are full 22 cols. Test input has complex nested shapes (e.g., 7 inside 8's on left, 9's as bg? on right), requiring careful component bounding without breaking frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component extraction and classification are partially useful but need refinement for accurate bounding and placement. Background detection works well. Sorting by min row is correct in principle but fails in application due to placement.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent color, e.g., 0 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS stack for flood-fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting 4-connected non-bg components; essential for identifying shapes without diagonals.)

```python
def classify_shape(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 'left' if 8 in colors else 'right'
```
(This works for basic classification—'left' for bordered (has 8), 'right' for open—but may overclassify if 8 appears incidentally; useful but needs validation against examples.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(This provides min/max row/col for each component; helpful for positioning but insufficient alone, as shapes are irregular.)

```python
def sort_shapes(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple], List[Tuple]]:
    left = []
    right = []
    for comp in components:
        typ = classify_shape(comp, g)
        minr, maxr, minc, maxc = get_bounding(comp)
        h = maxr - minr + 1
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        entry = (minr, comp, minc, h, w)
        if typ == 'left':
            left.append(entry)
        else:
            right.append(entry)
    left.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    right.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    return left, right
```
(This sorts components by min row correctly, separating left/right; helpful for ordering but the tuple structure assumes rectangular placement, which fails for irregular shapes.)

The `place_shapes` function is broken/not helpful: It stacks shapes vertically from current_r=0, copying rectangular blocks, which ignores original row offsets, creates tight packing with no gaps, and overwrites without merging—leads to all generated outputs having stacked blocks starting at row 0 with bg fillers, mismatching expected spaced/offset placements.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incorrect placement: Shapes are extracted and classified accurately in some cases (e.g., 5's,3's as left in train1; 9's,1's as left in test), but placed as vertical stacks from row 0 on left (cols 0+) and right (cols 17+), resulting in contiguous blocks with bg (e.g., 0's or 8's) in between, instead of offset by original minr or merged structures.
 * Train1: Generated stacks bordered shapes (8+5,8+3,8+4) on left starting row0 with 8/0 fillers, open shapes (2+1,2+3,2+9,2+6) on right; expected has left with original-like bordered placements offset (e.g., 5's at row2-4, 3's at row6-8 but merged/extended horizontally into cols5-9 with 8's), right with open shapes at specific rows (e.g., 1's at row3-5 col17-20, 9's at row11-13 col17-20) and gaps (e.g., all-2 rows); difference: no stacking, preserves relative row spacing, adds transitional 8's on left, no middle 0's on right.
 * Train2: Generated similar stacking (left:8+9,8+3,8+1,8+6 with 4 bg; right:2+5,2+3,2+6,2+1); expected repositions with offsets (e.g., left 9's at row2-5 col0-4, but 5's/3's on right at row1-5 col12-16 and row8-10 col17-20? Wait, mixed—actually right has 5's at col12-16 row1-4, 3's col17-20 row8-10), bottom 4 bars full-width; difference: shapes placed at approximate original rows (not stacked), left/right overlap in middle cols for transitions, full-row 4's at bottom not stacked.
 * Train3: Generated stacks (top 2+3 on left? misclassified, then 8+6,8+2,8+3 on left, various on right with 1 bg); expected has more integrated left (e.g., 2's/3's open on right col17+, but 8+2/8+3 bordered on left at rows1-4/15-18), 6's/5's/4's offset on right/middle; difference: Classification flips some (e.g., top 3's open in expected right, but stacked left in generated), no row offsets, bottom 1's full but not handled as special.
 * Overall: Component finding works (identifies all shapes), sorting by minr is applied but unused effectively, classification mostly correct (8 presence detects borders) but may miss nested cases (e.g., 7 inside 8 in test). Placement is the core failure—stacking ignores gaps/offsets, assumes rectangular copy (clips irregular shapes), uses fixed cols 0/17 without middle transitions. No handling for full-width elements (e.g., bottom bars in train2/3) or merged borders. Generated outputs show tight left stacks (e.g., 8 blocks followed by inner shapes) and right stacks with 2 borders, but expected has spaced, original-row-aligned placements with bg gaps and horizontal extensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed stacking pattern as training examples (left: stacked 8+4/9's? Wait, 8+4 at row1-4 col0-4, then 8+1 at row6-8, etc., with 9's as bg? misdetected; right: 2+4/3/6/3 stacked from row0 col17), creating contiguous vertical blocks starting at row0 with 8/9/2 fillers and no gaps. This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should offset shapes by original minr like row2 for 4's, row6 for 1's; right should have open 4/3/6/3 at spaced rows col17-20 with 2 borders but no tight stack; left needs to preserve 8 frames around 4/1/7/3 without overwriting). Likely issues: Bg=8 or 9 mispropagates (9 seems like a shape color, not bg), nested 7's inside 8's on rows11-14 col2-4 treated as separate but should be framed left; bottom 9's/3's stacked right but expected offset with full-width elements. It looks incorrect because it compresses everything vertically without preserving spacing or handling nests/merges, similar to train failures—e.g., no middle transitions (cols5-16 all 9's/bg), and right lacks proper open shape isolation.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing various numbered cells (representing colored or shaped blobs) needs to be processed by identifying connected components (non-background blobs), separating them into "left" (those containing the number 8) and "right" (those without 8) groups, vertically grouping contiguous blocks of these components by row ranges, and then reassembling them side-by-side in a new 22x22 grid: left blocks placed flush left (starting at column 0) and right blocks placed flush right (starting at column 22 - total width), while preserving the relative row positions and internal shapes of each component without rotation or scaling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components with any cell equal to 8 are "left" (even if mixed numbers); those without 8 are "right"—this is a binary split, not per-number.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" only if their row ranges overlap or are adjacent (max row of previous +1 >= min row of next); sort blocks by starting row.
 * Within each block, sort components left-to-right by their original min column, then place them contiguously in the output: for left blocks, start at col 0; for right blocks, start at col (22 - sum of widths in block), where width = maxc - minc + 1.
 * When placing, copy exact cell values from original positions, but shift horizontally to the new contiguous position; do not alter rows, and only place if the target column is within 0-21 and the source cell is non-background.
 * Subtlety: Components may overlap in columns within a block, but placement concatenates their widths without merging or overlapping in output—treat as side-by-side abutment.
 * Easy to miss: 8 can appear anywhere in a left component (not just borders); right components never have 8; background cells in output start as bg but are overwritten only by non-bg source cells.
 * Vertical gaps between blocks are preserved (empty rows in output stay bg); no vertical shifting or compression.
 * Input grids are 22x22; output must be exactly 22x22; numbers like 1-9 represent distinct "colors" or shapes to preserve exactly.
 * Potential edge cases: Single-cell components; blocks spanning full height; components with irregular shapes (not rectangles, so use min/max for bounding but copy actual cells); multiple blocks per side; zero-width or empty blocks (skip).
 * No rotation, reflection, or color changes; preserve all non-bg cells' values and positions relatively.

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, useful for all examples; e.g., 0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test.)

    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes and 8-flag is core and mostly correct; it accurately detects shapes in all examples but needs integration fixes for placement.)

```python
def group_blocks(shapes: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, bool]]]:
    blocks = []
    if not shapes:
        return blocks
    # Sort by minr first (missing in provided code; add: shapes = sorted(shapes, key=lambda x: x[0]))
    current_block = [shapes[0]]
    current_maxr = shapes[0][1]
    for s in shapes[1:]:
        minr = s[0]
        if minr > current_maxr + 1:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [s]
            current_maxr = s[1]
        else:
            current_block.append(s)
            current_maxr = max(current_maxr, s[1])
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This vertical grouping logic is helpful but buggy in provided code: assumes pre-sorted input and uses has8 tuple; needs sort by minr and strip has8 for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly identifies background (0 in train1, 1 in train3, 9 in test) and finds components with 8-flag, splitting into left/right— this works for core detection in all cases.
 * Grouping into vertical blocks works partially (e.g., train2 correct overall), but fails when components in a block have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential order, as sorting by minr is missing/incomplete.
 * Placement logic in place_block is broken: sorts by minc but then uses original minc for copying (causing misalignment); computes widths correctly but shifts incorrectly (e.g., uses minc + k for source but current + k for target without full offset); only copies if source non-bg but doesn't handle full shape copy (misses non-rectangular fills).
 * Train1 incorrect: Left blocks (with 8) placed mostly correct but right blocks shifted left too far (e.g., row2: 2's start at col12 in generated vs col17 in expected; row7: extra 2's in cols11-16; row8: 2's and 3's misplaced horizontally); bottom section (rows14-21) has 6/2/4/8 blobs concatenated wrong, with 8's on left but expected has them integrated differently—no vertical gaps preserved properly.
 * Train2 correct: All placements match expected, suggesting the logic works for simpler vertical alignments without overlaps or gaps.
 * Train3 incorrect: Top row has extra 1's and misplaced 2's (generated row0: 1's then 2's vs expected 1's then 2's but shifted); right blocks (no 8) like 3/5/4 placed too leftward (e.g., row1: 3's at col16-18 in generated vs col17-19 expected; row13: 2's at end but extra 2's in row12); left blocks with 8 correct but overall horizontal concatenation fails for multi-component blocks.
 * In all incorrect cases, right-side placement starts too early (not at 22 - total_w), causing overlap or squeeze; left flush is better but still misaligns internals.
 * Function place_block is broken/not helpful as-is: incorrect offset (uses minc in source loop, causing partial copies); doesn't copy full component cells, only bounding width slice—leads to missing parts in irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond place_block (which should be fixed, not discarded); find_components is essential and accurate for extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct), but placements are severely misaligned—e.g., top rows have 2/4/3 blobs crammed left with 9's filling right, but expected likely needs left (8-containing, like the 8/1/7/3 blobs mid-grid) flush left and right (no-8, like top 2/4/3 and bottom 6/3) flush right with gaps.
 * Specific differences: Row0: 9's then 2's starting col12 (too left; expected probably 9's full left or separated); row6: 8's at col16-20 but with 2/3 below misplaced; row16: 2/6 then 8/3/2/3 all jumbled leftward instead of split sides; bottom row21 all 9's (ok) but row20 has 8's in middle not right-flushed.
 * No vertical blocks seem grouped properly—e.g., the mid 8/1/7 block (rows7-12) should be a left block starting col0, but it's shifted right with 9's left; right blocks like bottom 2/6/3 not ending at col21.
 * Overall, doesn't match puzzle rules: Horizontal concatenation within blocks is broken (overlaps/gaps wrong), and side placement ignores flush rules—looks like partial left-placement only, ignoring right flush and block grouping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing a visual scene with a background color and various connected "components" (blobs of non-background cells, possibly representing objects like creatures or shapes). The goal is to extract these components, classify them based on whether they contain a special cell (value 8, perhaps indicating "eyes" or an entry point), group them into vertical "blocks" of overlapping or adjacent components, and repack them into a new grid by shifting left-classified blocks (with 8) to the left side and right-classified blocks (without 8) to the right side, while preserving their internal structure, vertical row positions, and horizontal tightness without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common cell value (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 or 9 in others), and all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Components are bounding-boxed (min/max row/col) and flagged if they contain at least one 8 (treated as a boolean "has_e" or "has_eye"); 8 cells are part of the component but may need special handling (e.g., not erased during packing).
 * Grouping into blocks: Components are sorted by starting row (min_r), then merged into blocks if their row ranges overlap or are exactly adjacent (current max_r +1 >= next min_r); this creates horizontal "slices" of vertically coherent objects, but subtle gaps (e.g., single empty row) might break blocks incorrectly.
 * Packing: For each block, sort components by min_c (left-to-right order), compute total width, place left blocks starting at col 0 (left-aligned), right blocks starting at n - total_w (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row, col-by-col, but only non-bg cells—overwriting bg in output; preserve exact shapes, but ensure no horizontal stretching/compression beyond bounding box.
 * Subtle elements: Components may touch bg or each other without merging if different values (but code merges any non-bg, so assumes same/different values connect if adjacent—may over-merge heterogeneous blobs); 8 might be a "hole" or special marker inside components, but it's included in connectivity; vertical positions must stay exact (no row shifting); right-packing may leave gaps on left if total_w < n; in examples, some components span multiple rows/cols irregularly (e.g., L-shapes), so bounding-box copying can leave "holes" in output if not all cells are filled.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping row blocks might cause vertical stacking issues if not handled; sorting blocks by min_r ensures top-to-bottom order; in right-packing, if is_left=False, start col is max(0, n - total_w) to avoid negative indices; components without 8 go right, with 8 go left—strict binary split; no rotation/reflection, just translation; output initializes to bg everywhere.
 * Across attempts: Connectivity uses DFS/stack correctly for finding components; Counter for bg is reliable; but packing ignores relative horizontal offsets within blocks (just abuts bounding boxes), which may distort if components have internal spacing; no handling for components that touch edges or wrap; 8 detection works but may flag entire blobs wrong if 8 is bg-adjacent.

        curr_col += w
```
(This packing logic is key for shifting but buggy—abuts bounding boxes without preserving internal gaps, leading to squished shapes; copies only non-bg, good; right-align calc prevents overflow.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated packs right-side blocks (e.g., 2's and 1's in rows 2-6) too far left (starting ~col 15 instead of ~col 17), causing overlap/shift with left blocks; bottom right 2/6/4 blocks misaligned vertically (e.g., row 13 has extra 2's on right not in expected); row 7 has 2's in cols 12-16 in generated but expected has them in 12-16 wait no—expected row 7: 2's in 12-16, but generated row 7: 2's in 15-19? Wait, counting shows generated row 2: 2's at end, but expected shifted right; unknown why grouping split the small 2-block wrong, leading to separate packing; left blocks (with 8) packed correctly but overwrote some bg incorrectly.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Full match, so component finding, classification (has_8 left/right), blocking, and packing worked perfectly for that grid's layout—suggests core logic handles simple non-overlapping vertical stacks well.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated row 0 has 1's across left (cols 0-4,10-20) but expected has 1's only on right (cols 16-21? Wait, expected row 0: 1's cols 0-14 then 2's 16-21); row 1 generated has 8's left and 2/3's mid but expected shifts 2/3's right; overall, left-packing (with 8) correct but right-blocks (no 8) packed too leftward (e.g., 2/3 in cols 12-16 instead of 16-21), squishing against left; unknown blob merging issue as top 1's blob seems over-classified/misplaced; bottom 2/4/3 blocks shifted left by ~4-6 cols.
 * General misses: Packing doesn't preserve original horizontal spacing between components in a block (just butts bounding boxes, causing compression); grouping tolerance (+1) may merge non-adjacent if rows touch bg wrongly; no validation for component overlaps post-pack; 8-detection flags whole component but 8 cells copy as-is, which is good but may leave "eyes" in wrong relative spots if shapes irregular.
 * Function `get_background` is correct and helpful.
 * `find_components` is essential and mostly accurate (good for extraction), but may over-connect if non-bg cells of different values touch (assumes all non-bg connect—check if puzzle requires same-value connectivity? Unknown, but examples suggest it works sometimes).
 * `group_into_blocks` is helpful but the +1 adjacency may be too loose (e.g., in ex1 row 7-8 gap breaks block wrong?).
 * `pack_block` is core but broken for multi-component blocks—src_c = minc + k assumes dense bounding box, but copies g[r][src_c] which includes internal bg/holes, but if shape has gaps, it copies bg (skipped), so shapes preserve but abutment loses offsets (e.g., if two components had space between, it squishes them).
 * Overall program in `program` ties it together well but fails on complex layouts (2/3 incorrect), showing partial understanding of splitting/packing but misses subtlety in block widths/offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it packs components (e.g., top 2/4/3 blocks with 8? Wait, 8's appear mid-grid) heavily to the left/mid (e.g., row 0: 9's left, 2's cols 12-16, 9's right; but expected likely needs tighter right-packing for no-8 blocks like bottom 2/6/3), creating uneven splits and overlaps (e.g., row 6: 8/2/3 mid-right, but squished against left 9's).
 * Missing right-alignment for no-8 components (e.g., row 16: 2/6 leftish, then 8/3 mid—should be pushed to cols ~16+); 9 as bg correct, but 8's (has_e) over-packed left, distorting shapes (e.g., row 7: 8's cols 0-4 but then scattered 8/2 right).
 * Does not make sense as final puzzle—looks like partial left-shift but failed to group vertical stacks (e.g., bottom 8/3 block in rows 16-20 abutted wrong, leaving gaps); likely over-merges components (e.g., 2/3 touching via 8?), causing total_w miscalc and bad curr_col starts; to fix, ensure same-value connectivity? Or adjust packing to preserve inter-component gaps by using original relative min_c offsets instead of abutting.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid by identifying background (most common value), extracting connected "shapes" (non-background components) separately for left and right sides—left starting from cells marked 8 and flooding to all non-background, right starting from cells marked 2 and flooding to non-background excluding 8—and then regrouping these shapes into vertical "blocks" based on row overlap, compressing them horizontally by their bounding boxes, and placing left blocks aligned to the left edge and right blocks aligned to the right edge of a new output grid, while preserving vertical positions and overwriting background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common value in the flattened grid; everything else is part of shapes, but shapes must be extracted via flood fill from specific seeds (8 for left, 2 for right) to separate left/right components—do not assume all non-bg are shapes without seeding.
 * Flood fill uses 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right); shapes are sets of cells with their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for later placement.
 * Left extraction: Start from unvisited 8 cells, flood to any adjacent non-bg (this can accidentally include right shapes if they connect via non-bg paths to 8's, which seems to happen in some cases).
 * Right extraction: Start from unvisited 2 cells after left extraction (using shared visited set), flood only to non-bg and non-8; this excludes left shapes but may miss isolated right shapes if they don't start from 2 or if visited by left flood.
 * Grouping: Sort shapes by min row, then cluster into "blocks" where shapes overlap in row range (min_r of next <= max_r of current); within each block, sort by min col and place sequentially without gaps, shifting entire shapes horizontally to pack tightly.
 * Placement: Output starts as all bg; for left blocks, start at col 0 and add shape widths sequentially; for right blocks, start at col (n - total_block_width) and add leftward; rows stay absolute (no vertical shift); only place if new_col in bounds, but this can clip shapes.
 * Subtleties: Shared visited set prevents re-flooding, but left flood's broad condition (!= bg) can overgrab if components touch; right flood's exclusion of 8 prevents left overlap but may fragment shapes containing 2's near 8's. Bg may vary (0,1,9 across examples). Grids are square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). No diagonal connectivity. Shapes with only bg or empty after flood are skipped. Horizontal compression assumes no overlaps in block, but vertical stacking of blocks is implicit via per-block processing. Easy to miss: right shapes may include numbers like 1,3,4,5,6,9 if connected to 2; left includes 3,4,5,6 but not 2's directly. If a 2 is connected to 8 via non-bg, it gets grabbed as left, causing misalignment (seen in examples).
 * All non-seed cells (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,9) are treated as shape pixels with their original values; do not change values during extraction/placement.
 * Potential edge cases: Shapes spanning full width (no compression needed); isolated shapes; blocks with single shape; right shapes with varying widths; bg=0/1/9; grids where left/right touch via bg only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg, uses flood fill for shape extraction, groups into row-overlapping blocks, and performs horizontal compression/placement separately for left/right, which works fully for training example 2 (exact match, preserving all shapes like 3's,5's,6's in correct positions).
 * What worked: Shared visited prevents double-extraction; seeding from 8/2 separates sides; bounding box calculation enables compression; vertical positions preserved; one training example passes completely, showing core extraction/placement logic is sound when shapes are cleanly separated.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1 (INCORRECT), left flood overgrabs right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-4 shapes placed on left instead of right, like row 13 generated has 2's starting at col 2 on left vs. expected all 0's until col 12 with 2's on right; row 16 generated has 2-2-2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-6-6-6-2 on right with 4's shifted; row 17 generated has 2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-2-2-2-2-2-4-4-4-2; unknown if due to connection via non-bg path to 8, but it misplaces entire blocks).
 * In training example 1, upper parts match (e.g., 5's,3's,1's on right correct), but lower right 9's and 6's/4's are fragmented or shifted leftward, and row 13 has extra 2's on left not in expected (expected has uniform 2's on right).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), left shapes (8-2-3-6) are placed correctly in middle-left, but right shapes are underplaced or overwritten: e.g., row 0 generated all 1's (bg) vs. expected 2's on right (missing top 2-3-4 block); row 1 generated has 2-3-3-3-2 on left-middle vs. expected on right; row 16 generated 2-2-2-2-2 on right but 3's misplaced left; overall, right blocks start too far left (e.g., total_width miscalculated, placing at col ~10 instead of n-5).
 * extract_objects via flood_fill is essential and mostly correct, but left flood condition (!= bg) is too broad (should perhaps exclude 2's or use stricter connectivity to prevent bleed); right flood (!= bg and !=8) is better but fails if 2's are visited by left.
 * The group_and_place function is helpful for blocking/packing but buggy in right-side base_col calculation (uses n - total_width, but if blocks have varying widths or overlaps, it packs left-to-right within right block, causing leftward shift into center).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (Counter for bg, flood, group, place) are relevant, though flood needs tuning for separation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules and patterns from training examples; it follows the same logic (bg=9, left from 8 including 1/7, right from 2 including 3/4/6), but shows similar issues as incorrect trainings: e.g., upper right 2-4-3 shapes are placed correctly compressed on right (rows 1-5 match expected pattern of packing 4's then 3's), but lower left 8-1-7 placed on left ok, yet row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 on left-middle then 2-3-3-3-2 on right (suggests overgrab of a 2-6 shape into left block, like ex1); row 17 has 2-2-2-2-2 on left then 8-3-3-3-8-2-3-3-3-2, with 3's split across center (expected likely packs right block tighter to right edge without left bleed); row 8 has isolated 8-1-1-1-8 on left but 7's below shifted, and right all 9's (missing any right shapes there?); overall, compression works for isolated blocks but shared visited + broad left flood causes right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-3) to fragment or misalign leftward, not fully right-justified as in correct ex2—does not match clean separation expected, likely needs stricter flood conditions to handle test's denser connections (e.g., 2's near 8's in rows 15-20).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```python
def find_shapes(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, background: int, opposite_frame: int, eight_cells: set = None) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    shapes = []
    visited = [[False] * 22 for _ in range(22)]
    for i in range(22):
        for j in range(22):
            if g[i][j] == frame_color and not visited[i][j] and (eight_cells is None or (i, j) not in eight_cells):
                frame_cells = []
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                frame_cells.append((i, j))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == frame_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            frame_cells.append((nx, ny))
                inner_cells = set()
                for x, y in frame_cells:
                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                                continue
                            nx = x + dx
                            ny = y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and (nx, ny) not in inner_cells and g[nx][ny] != background and g[nx][ny] != opposite_frame and g[nx][ny] != frame_color:
                                inner_cells.add((nx, ny))
                all_cells = frame_cells + list(inner_cells)
                if all_cells:
                    minr = min(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    maxr = max(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    minc = min(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    maxc = max(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    shapes.append({'minr': minr, 'maxr': maxr, 'minc': minc, 'maxc': maxc})
    return shapes
```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

```python
def place_left_shapes(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], background: int, shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]):
    current_left_width = 0
    last_maxr_left = -1
    for sh in shapes:
        minr = sh['minr']
        maxr = sh['maxr']
        minc = sh['minc']
        maxc = sh['maxc']
        w = maxc - minc + 1
        if minr > last_maxr_left + 1:
            proposed_left = 0
        else:
            proposed_left = current_left_width
        # place (assume no conflict)
        for rr in range(minr, maxr + 1):
            for kk in range(w):
                oc = proposed_left + kk
                if oc < 22:
                    nv = g[rr][minc + kk]
                    if nv != background:
                        out[rr][oc] = nv
        current_left_width = max(current_left_width, proposed_left + w)
        last_maxr_left = maxr
```
(This handles left stacking with vertical block detection; works for non-overlapping left placements but assumes no conflicts—fine for 8-shapes as they go first.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

(This is core for extracting connected frame components and their adjacent inners, returning bounding boxes and used cells; helpful for separation of left/right.)

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

                visited_temp.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))

def get_col_start_framed(min_r: int, min_c: int) -> int:

    if min_r >= 10:

    else:
        if min_c >= 12:
            return 5
        else:
            return 0

def get_col_start_unframed(min_c: int) -> int:
    """Column start for unframed: based on centered min_col."""
    center = min_c + 2
    if center < 11:
        return 12
    else:
        return 17
```
These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:30:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid rearrangement where connected non-background "objects" (blobs) are identified, grouped into horizontal blocks based on row overlap, and then repacked into a new grid: special objects (those containing the number 8) are placed on the left side, while non-special objects are placed on the right side, all within their respective blocks, preserving relative shapes and positions vertically but shifting horizontally for packing without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value in the grid (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 in ex3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only, no diagonals), found via DFS/stack traversal, tracking bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and presence of 8 (a marker for "special" or "framed" objects).
 * Components are sorted by starting position (min row, then min col) before grouping into blocks.
 * Blocks are formed by merging components whose row ranges overlap (if a component's min row <= current block's max row, add it and update max row); this creates horizontal "layers" of interacting objects.
 * Within each block, special (has8=True) components are packed left-aligned starting at col 0, sorted by min col, shifted right sequentially without gaps.
 * Non-special components are packed on the right, but positioning logic must account for block-specific context: if the original block's min col <9 (suggesting left-side origin), start at col 12; else right-align from n - total_width. This heuristic is flawed and leads to overlaps or misplacements.
 * Vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly; only horizontal shifts occur during packing.
 * Empty rows/cols in output are filled with background.
 * Subtle: 8 often forms "frames" around other numbers (e.g., outlining 5's in ex1, 2's in ex3), so components with 8 include the frame and interior; non-8 components are plain shapes.
 * Objects must not overlap in output, but shapes must remain intact (no rotation, scaling, or splitting).
 * Grid size n x n is fixed (22x22 in examples), and output must match exactly, including all details like isolated numbers or extensions (e.g., 1's protruding in ex1 expected).
 * Easy to miss: Some objects span multiple blocks if row overlaps chain; packing must handle variable widths and ensure right-side starts don't clip or gap incorrectly.
 * In ex1 expected, some non-special like 1's and 3's are packed right but with specific alignments (e.g., 1's under 2's frame); in ex3, top extensions of 1's into row 0 are missing in generated.
 * Test input has complex overlaps (e.g., 8-frames around 1's,4's,7's,3's; plain 2's,6's), so block grouping is critical to avoid scattering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and block grouping worked well, correctly identifying blobs, 8-presence, and row-overlap blocks (evident in ex2 passing fully).
 * Left-side packing for has8 components is accurate: in ex1 generated, the 5/8 frame packs correctly left; in ex3, 2/8 and 3/8 frames pack left properly.
 * Ex2 correct: All elements (frames and plains) packed into correct blocks and sides without misplacement, showing core detection/packing works for simple cases.
 * Ex1 incorrect: Right-side non-8 objects (3's,1's,2's) misplaced—generated packs 3's too far right (cols 11-14) and 1's absent/misaligned, while expected has 3's under extended 8-frame (cols 6-8) and 1's (cols 18-20) under 2-frame; also lower 2/6/4 blocks wrong (e.g., 6's not framed correctly, 4's shifted left).
 * Ex3 incorrect: Top row generated has mixed 1's/2's (cols 0-10 wrong), missing expected plain 1's extension; right-side 5's and 2's/6's mispacked (e.g., 5's start at col 13 but expected at col 12; lower 4/3/8 block has 4's too left, 3's not aligned under expected positions); unknown why top 1's blob isn't preserved as plain right-side.
 * Right-side packing logic broken: Heuristic "12 if minc<9 else n-total_w" fails for variable block origins—causes overlaps/gaps (e.g., ex1 3's overlap potential left space; ex3 5's gap from left block); doesn't sort/pack sequentially like left side.
 * No rotation or shape alteration, but attempts preserve cells correctly.
 * find_components is essential and accurate for extraction (use in future).
 * pack_side is helpful for left but needs fix for right (e.g., always calculate available space after left pack, or use fixed split like col 11).
 * group_into_blocks is solid but assumes sorted input; subtle miss: if blocks have no has8, all go right—ensure no empty left.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though right-pack heuristic is flawed (avoid as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It scatters elements oddly (e.g., top 9's background with 2/4's packed leftish but 8/4's intrude row3 col17-20 overlapping potential right; mid 1/8 frame at left but 7's inside shifted wrong; lower 6/2's and 3/8 mix left/right incorrectly, with 3's at col17-19 under 8 but expected likely right-aligned after left frames like 1/8 and 4/8).
 * Missing clean separation: Expected should have clear left frames (8-around-1,4,7,3) packed sequentially from col0 per block, rights (plain 2,6,4,3?) starting after (e.g., col11 or calculated), but generated has overlaps (e.g., row17 8/3 at col11-16 clashing with potential 2/3 right) and unframed 4's/3's misplaced.
 * Background 9's fill correctly, but shapes distorted by bad shifts (e.g., row4 4/8 at col17-20 should be part of right or separate block; unknown why 7's frame doesn't include full outline).
 * Does not match training patterns: Ex1/3 expect tight packing without col12 heuristic failures; test likely needs dynamic right-start (e.g., max left width + gap) to avoid this mess.

[2025-10-02 22:30:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

                src_c = minc + k
                dst_c = curr_col + k
                if 0 <= dst_c < n:
                    nv = g[r][src_c]

                        out_g[r][dst_c] = nv
        curr_col += w
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid by identifying background (most common value), extracting connected "shapes" (non-background components) separately for left and right sides—left starting from cells marked 8 and flooding to all non-background, right starting from cells marked 2 and flooding to non-background excluding 8—and then regrouping these shapes into vertical "blocks" based on row overlap, compressing them horizontally by their bounding boxes, and placing left blocks aligned to the left edge and right blocks aligned to the right edge of a new output grid, while preserving vertical positions and overwriting background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common value in the flattened grid; everything else is part of shapes, but shapes must be extracted via flood fill from specific seeds (8 for left, 2 for right) to separate left/right components—do not assume all non-bg are shapes without seeding.
 * Flood fill uses 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right); shapes are sets of cells with their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for later placement.
 * Left extraction: Start from unvisited 8 cells, flood to any adjacent non-bg (this can accidentally include right shapes if they connect via non-bg paths to 8's, which seems to happen in some cases).
 * Right extraction: Start from unvisited 2 cells after left extraction (using shared visited set), flood only to non-bg and non-8; this excludes left shapes but may miss isolated right shapes if they don't start from 2 or if visited by left flood.
 * Grouping: Sort shapes by min row, then cluster into "blocks" where shapes overlap in row range (min_r of next <= max_r of current); within each block, sort by min col and place sequentially without gaps, shifting entire shapes horizontally to pack tightly.
 * Placement: Output starts as all bg; for left blocks, start at col 0 and add shape widths sequentially; for right blocks, start at col (n - total_block_width) and add leftward; rows stay absolute (no vertical shift); only place if new_col in bounds, but this can clip shapes.
 * Subtleties: Shared visited set prevents re-flooding, but left flood's broad condition (!= bg) can overgrab if components touch; right flood's exclusion of 8 prevents left overlap but may fragment shapes containing 2's near 8's. Bg may vary (0,1,9 across examples). Grids are square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). No diagonal connectivity. Shapes with only bg or empty after flood are skipped. Horizontal compression assumes no overlaps in block, but vertical stacking of blocks is implicit via per-block processing. Easy to miss: right shapes may include numbers like 1,3,4,5,6,9 if connected to 2; left includes 3,4,5,6 but not 2's directly. If a 2 is connected to 8 via non-bg, it gets grabbed as left, causing misalignment (seen in examples).
 * All non-seed cells (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,9) are treated as shape pixels with their original values; do not change values during extraction/placement.
 * Potential edge cases: Shapes spanning full width (no compression needed); isolated shapes; blocks with single shape; right shapes with varying widths; bg=0/1/9; grids where left/right touch via bg only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg, uses flood fill for shape extraction, groups into row-overlapping blocks, and performs horizontal compression/placement separately for left/right, which works fully for training example 2 (exact match, preserving all shapes like 3's,5's,6's in correct positions).
 * What worked: Shared visited prevents double-extraction; seeding from 8/2 separates sides; bounding box calculation enables compression; vertical positions preserved; one training example passes completely, showing core extraction/placement logic is sound when shapes are cleanly separated.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1 (INCORRECT), left flood overgrabs right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-4 shapes placed on left instead of right, like row 13 generated has 2's starting at col 2 on left vs. expected all 0's until col 12 with 2's on right; row 16 generated has 2-2-2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-6-6-6-2 on right with 4's shifted; row 17 generated has 2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-2-2-2-2-2-4-4-4-2; unknown if due to connection via non-bg path to 8, but it misplaces entire blocks).
 * In training example 1, upper parts match (e.g., 5's,3's,1's on right correct), but lower right 9's and 6's/4's are fragmented or shifted leftward, and row 13 has extra 2's on left not in expected (expected has uniform 2's on right).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), left shapes (8-2-3-6) are placed correctly in middle-left, but right shapes are underplaced or overwritten: e.g., row 0 generated all 1's (bg) vs. expected 2's on right (missing top 2-3-4 block); row 1 generated has 2-3-3-3-2 on left-middle vs. expected on right; row 16 generated 2-2-2-2-2 on right but 3's misplaced left; overall, right blocks start too far left (e.g., total_width miscalculated, placing at col ~10 instead of n-5).
 * extract_objects via flood_fill is essential and mostly correct, but left flood condition (!= bg) is too broad (should perhaps exclude 2's or use stricter connectivity to prevent bleed); right flood (!= bg and !=8) is better but fails if 2's are visited by left.
 * The group_and_place function is helpful for blocking/packing but buggy in right-side base_col calculation (uses n - total_width, but if blocks have varying widths or overlaps, it packs left-to-right within right block, causing leftward shift into center).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (Counter for bg, flood, group, place) are relevant, though flood needs tuning for separation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules and patterns from training examples; it follows the same logic (bg=9, left from 8 including 1/7, right from 2 including 3/4/6), but shows similar issues as incorrect trainings: e.g., upper right 2-4-3 shapes are placed correctly compressed on right (rows 1-5 match expected pattern of packing 4's then 3's), but lower left 8-1-7 placed on left ok, yet row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 on left-middle then 2-3-3-3-2 on right (suggests overgrab of a 2-6 shape into left block, like ex1); row 17 has 2-2-2-2-2 on left then 8-3-3-3-8-2-3-3-3-2, with 3's split across center (expected likely packs right block tighter to right edge without left bleed); row 8 has isolated 8-1-1-1-8 on left but 7's below shifted, and right all 9's (missing any right shapes there?); overall, compression works for isolated blocks but shared visited + broad left flood causes right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-3) to fragment or misalign leftward, not fully right-justified as in correct ex2—does not match clean separation expected, likely needs stricter flood conditions to handle test's denser connections (e.g., 2's near 8's in rows 15-20).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid rearrangement where connected non-background "objects" (blobs) are identified, grouped into horizontal blocks based on row overlap, and then repacked into a new grid: special objects (those containing the number 8) are placed on the left side, while non-special objects are placed on the right side, all within their respective blocks, preserving relative shapes and positions vertically but shifting horizontally for packing without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value in the grid (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 in ex3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only, no diagonals), found via DFS/stack traversal, tracking bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and presence of 8 (a marker for "special" or "framed" objects).
 * Components are sorted by starting position (min row, then min col) before grouping into blocks.
 * Blocks are formed by merging components whose row ranges overlap (if a component's min row <= current block's max row, add it and update max row); this creates horizontal "layers" of interacting objects.
 * Within each block, special (has8=True) components are packed left-aligned starting at col 0, sorted by min col, shifted right sequentially without gaps.
 * Non-special components are packed on the right, but positioning logic must account for block-specific context: if the original block's min col <9 (suggesting left-side origin), start at col 12; else right-align from n - total_width. This heuristic is flawed and leads to overlaps or misplacements.
 * Vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly; only horizontal shifts occur during packing.
 * Empty rows/cols in output are filled with background.
 * Subtle: 8 often forms "frames" around other numbers (e.g., outlining 5's in ex1, 2's in ex3), so components with 8 include the frame and interior; non-8 components are plain shapes.
 * Objects must not overlap in output, but shapes must remain intact (no rotation, scaling, or splitting).
 * Grid size n x n is fixed (22x22 in examples), and output must match exactly, including all details like isolated numbers or extensions (e.g., 1's protruding in ex1 expected).
 * Easy to miss: Some objects span multiple blocks if row overlaps chain; packing must handle variable widths and ensure right-side starts don't clip or gap incorrectly.
 * In ex1 expected, some non-special like 1's and 3's are packed right but with specific alignments (e.g., 1's under 2's frame); in ex3, top extensions of 1's into row 0 are missing in generated.
 * Test input has complex overlaps (e.g., 8-frames around 1's,4's,7's,3's; plain 2's,6's), so block grouping is critical to avoid scattering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and block grouping worked well, correctly identifying blobs, 8-presence, and row-overlap blocks (evident in ex2 passing fully).
 * Left-side packing for has8 components is accurate: in ex1 generated, the 5/8 frame packs correctly left; in ex3, 2/8 and 3/8 frames pack left properly.
 * Ex2 correct: All elements (frames and plains) packed into correct blocks and sides without misplacement, showing core detection/packing works for simple cases.
 * Ex1 incorrect: Right-side non-8 objects (3's,1's,2's) misplaced—generated packs 3's too far right (cols 11-14) and 1's absent/misaligned, while expected has 3's under extended 8-frame (cols 6-8) and 1's (cols 18-20) under 2-frame; also lower 2/6/4 blocks wrong (e.g., 6's not framed correctly, 4's shifted left).
 * Ex3 incorrect: Top row generated has mixed 1's/2's (cols 0-10 wrong), missing expected plain 1's extension; right-side 5's and 2's/6's mispacked (e.g., 5's start at col 13 but expected at col 12; lower 4/3/8 block has 4's too left, 3's not aligned under expected positions); unknown why top 1's blob isn't preserved as plain right-side.
 * Right-side packing logic broken: Heuristic "12 if minc<9 else n-total_w" fails for variable block origins—causes overlaps/gaps (e.g., ex1 3's overlap potential left space; ex3 5's gap from left block); doesn't sort/pack sequentially like left side.
 * No rotation or shape alteration, but attempts preserve cells correctly.
 * find_components is essential and accurate for extraction (use in future).
 * pack_side is helpful for left but needs fix for right (e.g., always calculate available space after left pack, or use fixed split like col 11).
 * group_into_blocks is solid but assumes sorted input; subtle miss: if blocks have no has8, all go right—ensure no empty left.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though right-pack heuristic is flawed (avoid as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It scatters elements oddly (e.g., top 9's background with 2/4's packed leftish but 8/4's intrude row3 col17-20 overlapping potential right; mid 1/8 frame at left but 7's inside shifted wrong; lower 6/2's and 3/8 mix left/right incorrectly, with 3's at col17-19 under 8 but expected likely right-aligned after left frames like 1/8 and 4/8).
 * Missing clean separation: Expected should have clear left frames (8-around-1,4,7,3) packed sequentially from col0 per block, rights (plain 2,6,4,3?) starting after (e.g., col11 or calculated), but generated has overlaps (e.g., row17 8/3 at col11-16 clashing with potential 2/3 right) and unframed 4's/3's misplaced.
 * Background 9's fill correctly, but shapes distorted by bad shifts (e.g., row4 4/8 at col17-20 should be part of right or separate block; unknown why 7's frame doesn't include full outline).
 * Does not match training patterns: Ex1/3 expect tight packing without col12 heuristic failures; test likely needs dynamic right-start (e.g., max left width + gap) to avoid this mess.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This handles left stacking with vertical block detection; works for non-overlapping left placements but assumes no conflicts—fine for 8-shapes as they go first.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))

            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited_temp and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited_temp.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```

```python
def get_col_start_framed(min_r: int, min_c: int) -> int:
    """Column start for framed objects: row-dependent with col check."""
    if min_r >= 10:
        return 0
    else:
        if min_c >= 12:
            return 5
        else:
            return 0

def get_col_start_unframed(min_c: int) -> int:
    """Column start for unframed: based on centered min_col."""
    center = min_c + 2
    if center < 11:
        return 12
    else:
        return 17
```
These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:43:36] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing a scene or diagram with background, connected "objects" (components), and special elements marked by 8 (likely indicators like "E" for emphasis or extraction). The goal is to rearrange these components into a new grid: "left" components (those containing 8) are stacked or aligned on the left side (columns 0+), while "right" components (without 8) are placed in fixed right-side positions (e.g., starting at columns 12 or 17), all on a background, preserving shapes and connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-way connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components containing at least one 8 are treated as "left" and must be placed in a vertically stacked manner on the left, sorted by top-left position (min row, then min column), with vertical gaps preserved (e.g., if a component starts below the previous one's max row +1, it starts a new "column" at 0; otherwise, it appends horizontally).
 * "Right" components (no 8) are placed rigidly: those originally in leftish positions (min column <=8) go to column 12; those in rightish positions (min column >8) go to column 17, without sorting or stacking—simple horizontal shift.
 * Preserve exact shapes: when placing, shift cells by delta columns (and rows if needed, but code assumes row-aligned), overwriting background only if new position is in bounds (0 to n-1); no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Subtle: Components may span multiple rows/columns; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement offsets. 8-cells are not special beyond flagging the component—copy them as-is.
 * Gaps in vertical stacking for left components: If a left component's min row > previous max row +1, reset horizontal position to column 0; else, continue from current width. This handles multi-level "scenes" but can misalign if sorting or gap logic fails.
 * Right placement is heuristic-based (threshold at column 8), assuming grid width ~22; may fail if components overlap post-shift or if original positions vary.
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting in DFS/BFS for components; flat Counter for background works but assumes no ties (most_common(1)). No handling for isolated 8s or components touching edges.
 * Overall: Output grid starts as all-background; placements don't merge or resolve overlaps (but code avoids by position choice). n=22 in examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as the mode; useful and correct across attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                cells: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                has_e = False
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS for component traversal
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    cells.append((x, y))
                    if g[x][y] == 8:
                        has_e = True
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append({
                    'cells': cells,
                    'minr': min_r,
                    'maxr': max_r,
                    'minc': min_c,
                    'maxc': max_c,
                    'has8': has_e
                })
    return components
```
(This extracts components correctly with bounding boxes and 8-flag; essential for separation and placement; DFS stack handles irregular shapes well.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    bg = get_background(g)
    all_comps = find_components(g, bg)
    left_comps = [c for c in all_comps if c['has8']]
    right_comps = [c for c in all_comps if not c['has8']]
    out = [[bg for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Placement functions called here (see below)
    return out
```
(Top-level structure is solid: separate by has8, init output as bg, place left then right.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified bg=1, extracted components, separated left (with 8) vs right, placed left stacked on cols 0+ with gap logic, right at fixed cols 12/17 based on original minc <=8 threshold, producing exact matches.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated output has misplaced left components—e.g., row 0 starts with five 2s then 1s (expected all 1s then five 2s at end); rows 1-4 have 2,3,3,3,2 + 8s in cols 5-9 but shifted wrong (expected 8s in cols 0-4, then 1s, with 2,3 in cols 17-21); bottom sections like rows 6-8 have 8,6 in cols 0-4 but expected 1s there with 6s shifted right; row 13 has 2,5 in cols 12-16 but expected 1s in cols 0-16 with 2,4 in 17-21—overall, left stacking ignores some vertical alignments/gaps, causing overlap or offset; right placements use fixed cols but threshold misclassifies some components (e.g., original minc >8 but placed at 12).
 * Sorting left_comps by (minr, minc) works for simple cases but fails when components have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential vertical positions in train 3, leading to horizontal crowding instead of proper stacking.
 * Gap logic in place_left_components (if minr > last_maxr +1, reset to col 0; else append to current_width) is partially correct but doesn't handle multi-column resets well, causing left components to bleed into mid-grid (e.g., 8s in cols 5-9 instead of 0-4).
 * Right placement heuristic (col 12 if minc<=8, else 17) works for train 1/2 but in train 3 shifts some right components too left (e.g., 3s/4s appear in cols 17-21 correctly in expected, but generated has them mixed with 2s/5s in cols 12-16); no vertical alignment for right, assuming row-preserved, but bounds check clips edges.
 * No overlaps resolved in placement (code just overwrites if in bounds), but train 3 generated shows no clipping issues—just misalignment.
 * Component extraction is accurate (finds all non-bg blobs with has8 flag), but separation assumes all 8-components are "left" without checking size/connectivity to 8.
 * Unhelpful: No rotation or shape validation functions (not needed, as placements preserve orientation). The current place_right_components is simplistic/heuristic and broken for variable component positions—don't reuse without dynamic col calculation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (plausible as most common); components extracted (e.g., 8s with 4s on left, 1s/7s mid, 2/3/5/6 rightish); left placements (with 8s) stacked in cols 0-4/11-16-ish but irregular—e.g., rows 3-7 have 8,4 in cols 0-4 (good), but row 8 has 8s scattered in cols 11-16 (unexpected shift); row 16 has 2,6,2,3 in cols 11-16 + 8s in 17-20 (mixes left/right logic).
 * Right components placed at ~cols 12-16 (for original leftish) and 17-21 (for rightish), e.g., 2,4 in rows 1-3 cols 12-16 (seems ok), 7s in rows 9-12 cols 12-16 (but original minc may >8, should be 17?), 3s/6s mixed in rows 15-20 cols 11-16/17-20—overlaps or wrong threshold cause 8s to appear in right area (row 20 cols 17-20), violating separation.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have clean left stack (all 8-components in cols 0-~10, vertically gapped, rows preserved); right in 12+ with no 8s leaking; e.g., top 2,4 blob should be right at col 12, bottom 3s at 17, mid 1/7 with 8 at left cols 0-4 rows 8-12. Generated has row 0 all 9s except 2s at 12-16 + end (minor shift ok?), but row 16's 8s in right (wrong—8s must be left); row 21 all 9s good. Overall, ~70% aligned but placement thresholds/gaps fail for dense/multi-level components, similar to train 3 error.

[2025-10-02 22:43:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid by identifying background (most common value), extracting connected "shapes" (non-background components) separately for left and right sides—left starting from cells marked 8 and flooding to all non-background, right starting from cells marked 2 and flooding to non-background excluding 8—and then regrouping these shapes into vertical "blocks" based on row overlap, compressing them horizontally by their bounding boxes, and placing left blocks aligned to the left edge and right blocks aligned to the right edge of a new output grid, while preserving vertical positions and overwriting background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common value in the flattened grid; everything else is part of shapes, but shapes must be extracted via flood fill from specific seeds (8 for left, 2 for right) to separate left/right components—do not assume all non-bg are shapes without seeding.
 * Flood fill uses 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right); shapes are sets of cells with their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for later placement.
 * Left extraction: Start from unvisited 8 cells, flood to any adjacent non-bg (this can accidentally include right shapes if they connect via non-bg paths to 8's, which seems to happen in some cases).
 * Right extraction: Start from unvisited 2 cells after left extraction (using shared visited set), flood only to non-bg and non-8; this excludes left shapes but may miss isolated right shapes if they don't start from 2 or if visited by left flood.
 * Grouping: Sort shapes by min row, then cluster into "blocks" where shapes overlap in row range (min_r of next <= max_r of current); within each block, sort by min col and place sequentially without gaps, shifting entire shapes horizontally to pack tightly.
 * Placement: Output starts as all bg; for left blocks, start at col 0 and add shape widths sequentially; for right blocks, start at col (n - total_block_width) and add leftward; rows stay absolute (no vertical shift); only place if new_col in bounds, but this can clip shapes.
 * Subtleties: Shared visited set prevents re-flooding, but left flood's broad condition (!= bg) can overgrab if components touch; right flood's exclusion of 8 prevents left overlap but may fragment shapes containing 2's near 8's. Bg may vary (0,1,9 across examples). Grids are square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). No diagonal connectivity. Shapes with only bg or empty after flood are skipped. Horizontal compression assumes no overlaps in block, but vertical stacking of blocks is implicit via per-block processing. Easy to miss: right shapes may include numbers like 1,3,4,5,6,9 if connected to 2; left includes 3,4,5,6 but not 2's directly. If a 2 is connected to 8 via non-bg, it gets grabbed as left, causing misalignment (seen in examples).
 * All non-seed cells (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,9) are treated as shape pixels with their original values; do not change values during extraction/placement.
 * Potential edge cases: Shapes spanning full width (no compression needed); isolated shapes; blocks with single shape; right shapes with varying widths; bg=0/1/9; grids where left/right touch via bg only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg, uses flood fill for shape extraction, groups into row-overlapping blocks, and performs horizontal compression/placement separately for left/right, which works fully for training example 2 (exact match, preserving all shapes like 3's,5's,6's in correct positions).
 * What worked: Shared visited prevents double-extraction; seeding from 8/2 separates sides; bounding box calculation enables compression; vertical positions preserved; one training example passes completely, showing core extraction/placement logic is sound when shapes are cleanly separated.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1 (INCORRECT), left flood overgrabs right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-4 shapes placed on left instead of right, like row 13 generated has 2's starting at col 2 on left vs. expected all 0's until col 12 with 2's on right; row 16 generated has 2-2-2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-6-6-6-2 on right with 4's shifted; row 17 generated has 2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-2-2-2-2-2-4-4-4-2; unknown if due to connection via non-bg path to 8, but it misplaces entire blocks).
 * In training example 1, upper parts match (e.g., 5's,3's,1's on right correct), but lower right 9's and 6's/4's are fragmented or shifted leftward, and row 13 has extra 2's on left not in expected (expected has uniform 2's on right).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), left shapes (8-2-3-6) are placed correctly in middle-left, but right shapes are underplaced or overwritten: e.g., row 0 generated all 1's (bg) vs. expected 2's on right (missing top 2-3-4 block); row 1 generated has 2-3-3-3-2 on left-middle vs. expected on right; row 16 generated 2-2-2-2-2 on right but 3's misplaced left; overall, right blocks start too far left (e.g., total_width miscalculated, placing at col ~10 instead of n-5).
 * extract_objects via flood_fill is essential and mostly correct, but left flood condition (!= bg) is too broad (should perhaps exclude 2's or use stricter connectivity to prevent bleed); right flood (!= bg and !=8) is better but fails if 2's are visited by left.
 * The group_and_place function is helpful for blocking/packing but buggy in right-side base_col calculation (uses n - total_width, but if blocks have varying widths or overlaps, it packs left-to-right within right block, causing leftward shift into center).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (Counter for bg, flood, group, place) are relevant, though flood needs tuning for separation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules and patterns from training examples; it follows the same logic (bg=9, left from 8 including 1/7, right from 2 including 3/4/6), but shows similar issues as incorrect trainings: e.g., upper right 2-4-3 shapes are placed correctly compressed on right (rows 1-5 match expected pattern of packing 4's then 3's), but lower left 8-1-7 placed on left ok, yet row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 on left-middle then 2-3-3-3-2 on right (suggests overgrab of a 2-6 shape into left block, like ex1); row 17 has 2-2-2-2-2 on left then 8-3-3-3-8-2-3-3-3-2, with 3's split across center (expected likely packs right block tighter to right edge without left bleed); row 8 has isolated 8-1-1-1-8 on left but 7's below shifted, and right all 9's (missing any right shapes there?); overall, compression works for isolated blocks but shared visited + broad left flood causes right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-3) to fragment or misalign leftward, not fully right-justified as in correct ex2—does not match clean separation expected, likely needs stricter flood conditions to handle test's denser connections (e.g., 2's near 8's in rows 15-20).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid rearrangement where connected non-background "objects" (blobs) are identified, grouped into horizontal blocks based on row overlap, and then repacked into a new grid: special objects (those containing the number 8) are placed on the left side, while non-special objects are placed on the right side, all within their respective blocks, preserving relative shapes and positions vertically but shifting horizontally for packing without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value in the grid (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 in ex3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only, no diagonals), found via DFS/stack traversal, tracking bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and presence of 8 (a marker for "special" or "framed" objects).
 * Components are sorted by starting position (min row, then min col) before grouping into blocks.
 * Blocks are formed by merging components whose row ranges overlap (if a component's min row <= current block's max row, add it and update max row); this creates horizontal "layers" of interacting objects.
 * Within each block, special (has8=True) components are packed left-aligned starting at col 0, sorted by min col, shifted right sequentially without gaps.
 * Non-special components are packed on the right, but positioning logic must account for block-specific context: if the original block's min col <9 (suggesting left-side origin), start at col 12; else right-align from n - total_width. This heuristic is flawed and leads to overlaps or misplacements.
 * Vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly; only horizontal shifts occur during packing.
 * Empty rows/cols in output are filled with background.
 * Subtle: 8 often forms "frames" around other numbers (e.g., outlining 5's in ex1, 2's in ex3), so components with 8 include the frame and interior; non-8 components are plain shapes.
 * Objects must not overlap in output, but shapes must remain intact (no rotation, scaling, or splitting).
 * Grid size n x n is fixed (22x22 in examples), and output must match exactly, including all details like isolated numbers or extensions (e.g., 1's protruding in ex1 expected).
 * Easy to miss: Some objects span multiple blocks if row overlaps chain; packing must handle variable widths and ensure right-side starts don't clip or gap incorrectly.
 * In ex1 expected, some non-special like 1's and 3's are packed right but with specific alignments (e.g., 1's under 2's frame); in ex3, top extensions of 1's into row 0 are missing in generated.
 * Test input has complex overlaps (e.g., 8-frames around 1's,4's,7's,3's; plain 2's,6's), so block grouping is critical to avoid scattering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and block grouping worked well, correctly identifying blobs, 8-presence, and row-overlap blocks (evident in ex2 passing fully).
 * Left-side packing for has8 components is accurate: in ex1 generated, the 5/8 frame packs correctly left; in ex3, 2/8 and 3/8 frames pack left properly.
 * Ex2 correct: All elements (frames and plains) packed into correct blocks and sides without misplacement, showing core detection/packing works for simple cases.
 * Ex1 incorrect: Right-side non-8 objects (3's,1's,2's) misplaced—generated packs 3's too far right (cols 11-14) and 1's absent/misaligned, while expected has 3's under extended 8-frame (cols 6-8) and 1's (cols 18-20) under 2-frame; also lower 2/6/4 blocks wrong (e.g., 6's not framed correctly, 4's shifted left).
 * Ex3 incorrect: Top row generated has mixed 1's/2's (cols 0-10 wrong), missing expected plain 1's extension; right-side 5's and 2's/6's mispacked (e.g., 5's start at col 13 but expected at col 12; lower 4/3/8 block has 4's too left, 3's not aligned under expected positions); unknown why top 1's blob isn't preserved as plain right-side.
 * Right-side packing logic broken: Heuristic "12 if minc<9 else n-total_w" fails for variable block origins—causes overlaps/gaps (e.g., ex1 3's overlap potential left space; ex3 5's gap from left block); doesn't sort/pack sequentially like left side.
 * No rotation or shape alteration, but attempts preserve cells correctly.
 * find_components is essential and accurate for extraction (use in future).
 * pack_side is helpful for left but needs fix for right (e.g., always calculate available space after left pack, or use fixed split like col 11).
 * group_into_blocks is solid but assumes sorted input; subtle miss: if blocks have no has8, all go right—ensure no empty left.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though right-pack heuristic is flawed (avoid as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It scatters elements oddly (e.g., top 9's background with 2/4's packed leftish but 8/4's intrude row3 col17-20 overlapping potential right; mid 1/8 frame at left but 7's inside shifted wrong; lower 6/2's and 3/8 mix left/right incorrectly, with 3's at col17-19 under 8 but expected likely right-aligned after left frames like 1/8 and 4/8).
 * Missing clean separation: Expected should have clear left frames (8-around-1,4,7,3) packed sequentially from col0 per block, rights (plain 2,6,4,3?) starting after (e.g., col11 or calculated), but generated has overlaps (e.g., row17 8/3 at col11-16 clashing with potential 2/3 right) and unframed 4's/3's misplaced.
 * Background 9's fill correctly, but shapes distorted by bad shifts (e.g., row4 4/8 at col17-20 should be part of right or separate block; unknown why 7's frame doesn't include full outline).
 * Does not match training patterns: Ex1/3 expect tight packing without col12 heuristic failures; test likely needs dynamic right-start (e.g., max left width + gap) to avoid this mess.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:

                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:

                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))

    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

```
These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing a scene or diagram with background, connected "objects" (components), and special elements marked by 8 (likely indicators like "E" for emphasis or extraction). The goal is to rearrange these components into a new grid: "left" components (those containing 8) are stacked or aligned on the left side (columns 0+), while "right" components (without 8) are placed in fixed right-side positions (e.g., starting at columns 12 or 17), all on a background, preserving shapes and connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-way connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components containing at least one 8 are treated as "left" and must be placed in a vertically stacked manner on the left, sorted by top-left position (min row, then min column), with vertical gaps preserved (e.g., if a component starts below the previous one's max row +1, it starts a new "column" at 0; otherwise, it appends horizontally).
 * "Right" components (no 8) are placed rigidly: those originally in leftish positions (min column <=8) go to column 12; those in rightish positions (min column >8) go to column 17, without sorting or stacking—simple horizontal shift.
 * Preserve exact shapes: when placing, shift cells by delta columns (and rows if needed, but code assumes row-aligned), overwriting background only if new position is in bounds (0 to n-1); no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Subtle: Components may span multiple rows/columns; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement offsets. 8-cells are not special beyond flagging the component—copy them as-is.
 * Gaps in vertical stacking for left components: If a left component's min row > previous max row +1, reset horizontal position to column 0; else, continue from current width. This handles multi-level "scenes" but can misalign if sorting or gap logic fails.
 * Right placement is heuristic-based (threshold at column 8), assuming grid width ~22; may fail if components overlap post-shift or if original positions vary.
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting in DFS/BFS for components; flat Counter for background works but assumes no ties (most_common(1)). No handling for isolated 8s or components touching edges.
 * Overall: Output grid starts as all-background; placements don't merge or resolve overlaps (but code avoids by position choice). n=22 in examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as the mode; useful and correct across attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                cells: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                has_e = False
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS for component traversal
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    cells.append((x, y))
                    if g[x][y] == 8:
                        has_e = True
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append({
                    'cells': cells,
                    'minr': min_r,
                    'maxr': max_r,
                    'minc': min_c,
                    'maxc': max_c,
                    'has8': has_e
                })
    return components
```
(This extracts components correctly with bounding boxes and 8-flag; essential for separation and placement; DFS stack handles irregular shapes well.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    bg = get_background(g)
    all_comps = find_components(g, bg)
    left_comps = [c for c in all_comps if c['has8']]
    right_comps = [c for c in all_comps if not c['has8']]
    out = [[bg for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Placement functions called here (see below)
    return out
```
(Top-level structure is solid: separate by has8, init output as bg, place left then right.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified bg=1, extracted components, separated left (with 8) vs right, placed left stacked on cols 0+ with gap logic, right at fixed cols 12/17 based on original minc <=8 threshold, producing exact matches.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated output has misplaced left components—e.g., row 0 starts with five 2s then 1s (expected all 1s then five 2s at end); rows 1-4 have 2,3,3,3,2 + 8s in cols 5-9 but shifted wrong (expected 8s in cols 0-4, then 1s, with 2,3 in cols 17-21); bottom sections like rows 6-8 have 8,6 in cols 0-4 but expected 1s there with 6s shifted right; row 13 has 2,5 in cols 12-16 but expected 1s in cols 0-16 with 2,4 in 17-21—overall, left stacking ignores some vertical alignments/gaps, causing overlap or offset; right placements use fixed cols but threshold misclassifies some components (e.g., original minc >8 but placed at 12).
 * Sorting left_comps by (minr, minc) works for simple cases but fails when components have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential vertical positions in train 3, leading to horizontal crowding instead of proper stacking.
 * Gap logic in place_left_components (if minr > last_maxr +1, reset to col 0; else append to current_width) is partially correct but doesn't handle multi-column resets well, causing left components to bleed into mid-grid (e.g., 8s in cols 5-9 instead of 0-4).
 * Right placement heuristic (col 12 if minc<=8, else 17) works for train 1/2 but in train 3 shifts some right components too left (e.g., 3s/4s appear in cols 17-21 correctly in expected, but generated has them mixed with 2s/5s in cols 12-16); no vertical alignment for right, assuming row-preserved, but bounds check clips edges.
 * No overlaps resolved in placement (code just overwrites if in bounds), but train 3 generated shows no clipping issues—just misalignment.
 * Component extraction is accurate (finds all non-bg blobs with has8 flag), but separation assumes all 8-components are "left" without checking size/connectivity to 8.
 * Unhelpful: No rotation or shape validation functions (not needed, as placements preserve orientation). The current place_right_components is simplistic/heuristic and broken for variable component positions—don't reuse without dynamic col calculation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (plausible as most common); components extracted (e.g., 8s with 4s on left, 1s/7s mid, 2/3/5/6 rightish); left placements (with 8s) stacked in cols 0-4/11-16-ish but irregular—e.g., rows 3-7 have 8,4 in cols 0-4 (good), but row 8 has 8s scattered in cols 11-16 (unexpected shift); row 16 has 2,6,2,3 in cols 11-16 + 8s in 17-20 (mixes left/right logic).
 * Right components placed at ~cols 12-16 (for original leftish) and 17-21 (for rightish), e.g., 2,4 in rows 1-3 cols 12-16 (seems ok), 7s in rows 9-12 cols 12-16 (but original minc may >8, should be 17?), 3s/6s mixed in rows 15-20 cols 11-16/17-20—overlaps or wrong threshold cause 8s to appear in right area (row 20 cols 17-20), violating separation.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have clean left stack (all 8-components in cols 0-~10, vertically gapped, rows preserved); right in 12+ with no 8s leaking; e.g., top 2,4 blob should be right at col 12, bottom 3s at 17, mid 1/7 with 8 at left cols 0-4 rows 8-12. Generated has row 0 all 9s except 2s at 12-16 + end (minor shift ok?), but row 16's 8s in right (wrong—8s must be left); row 21 all 9s good. Overall, ~70% aligned but placement thresholds/gaps fail for dense/multi-level components, similar to train 3 error.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:51:42] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract "framed" shapes (outlined in specific colors like 8 for left-side objects and 2 for right-side objects) from a 22x22 grid, including their internal filled regions (non-background, non-frame colors), group these shapes into vertically contiguous "blocks" based on row overlap, and reassemble them into a new grid by placing left blocks flush left and right blocks flush right, while filling the rest with the background color. The process separates left and right objects to avoid overlap, preserving the relative horizontal ordering within blocks but compressing them to the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are identified as connected components (using 4-connectivity for the frame outline itself) of a specific color (8 for left, 2 for right), and their "inner" regions are flooded from 8-neighbor seeds adjacent to the frame (but using 4-connectivity for the flood fill), excluding background and frame cells; this captures enclosed or adjacent non-background content as part of the shape.
 * Shapes are treated as single units including both frame and inner cells; empty or background-only "shapes" are implicitly skipped since all_cells would be empty.
 * Grouping into blocks uses vertical sorting and merges components if their row ranges overlap (minr <= current maxr), creating horizontal strips of shapes; within each block, components are sorted left-to-right by minc and placed without gaps, but shifted to the left edge (for left blocks) or right edge (for right blocks) of the output grid.
 * Exclusion of already-used cells (from left when processing right) prevents double-claiming overlapping or shared elements; background is the most common color, and output starts filled with it.
 * Subtle connectivity: 4-dir for frame and inner flood ensures orthogonally connected blobs, but 8-dir seeds for inners allow detecting diagonally adjacent starts; this can miss thin diagonals or cause over-inclusion if not careful.
 * Placement shifts entire blocks by delta_c based on cumulative widths, but only copies if new_c is in bounds (0-21), potentially clipping edges; vertical positions (rows) are preserved from original.
 * Objects may span multiple rows/columns irregularly; right-side objects might have different frame colors or interleaving with left; inners can be multi-color but are copied as-is.
 * Potential misses: If a frame encloses multiple disconnected inners, the flood from multiple seeds might merge them incorrectly if they connect via 4-dir; background can appear inside frames but is excluded; no rotation or resizing—exact copy with horizontal compression per block.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; colors are integers 0-9, with 0 often background but varies (e.g., 1 in train 3).
 * All considerations: Avoid overwriting during placement (but code places sequentially, so left then right might overlap if blocks wide); handle cases where blocks don't fill full width; preserve exact cell values when copying; no vertical shifting or reordering blocks—order by original minr.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for excluding it and filling output.)

```
(This is core and helpful for extracting frame+inner shapes with proper connectivity and exclusion; returns bounding boxes and cells for grouping/placement.)

```python
def group_components(comps: List[Dict]) -> List[List[Dict]]:
    if not comps:
        return []
    comps = sorted(comps, key=lambda d: d['minr'])
    blocks: List[List[Dict]] = []
    current_block = [comps[0]]
    cur_max_r = comps[0]['maxr']
    for comp in comps[1:]:
        if comp['minr'] <= cur_max_r:
            current_block.append(comp)
            cur_max_r = max(cur_max_r, comp['maxr'])
        else:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [comp]
            cur_max_r = comp['maxr']
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(Helpful for vertically grouping overlapping shapes into blocks; sorts by minr and merges on row overlap.)

```python
def place_blocks(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], blocks: List[List[Dict]], is_left: bool):
    n = 22
    for block in blocks:
        if not block:
            continue
        block_comps = sorted(block, key=lambda d: d['minc'])
        widths = [d['maxc'] - d['minc'] + 1 for d in block_comps]
        total_w = sum(widths)
        b_start = 0 if is_left else n - total_w
        cum = 0
        for idx, comp in enumerate(block_comps):
            delta_c = b_start + cum - comp['minc']
            for r, c in comp['all_cells']:
                new_c = c + delta_c
                if 0 <= new_c < n:
                    out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
            cum += widths[idx]
```
(Helpful for placing blocks: sorts comps left-to-right, computes cumulative shift to edge, copies cells with column delta while preserving rows; bounds check prevents out-of-grid writes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 2 entirely, demonstrating core extraction, grouping, and placement logic works for some cases with standard left/right separation and vertical blocks.
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output misplaced right-side elements, e.g., row 13 (0-based) has scattered 2's and misplaced 6's/4's instead of a full horizontal 2-bar connecting the bottom shapes; row 14 has 2's starting too left with 6's; row 15 has 8's and 4's shifted wrong, and bottom 4's/2's compressed incorrectly (e.g., row 17 has extra 2's where expected has 2's+4's aligned differently); this suggests over-shifting or incorrect width calculation in place_blocks for right blocks, or missing a connecting frame/bar in grouping; left side mostly matched but had minor inner placements off (e.g., row 2 has extra 0's where expected has none).
 * For training 3 (INCORRECT): Top row (row 0) generated full left 1's+2's where expected has partial 1's+right 2's starting mid-grid; row 1 has 8's+2's+3's shifted left with extra 1's, but expected has 8's then 1's then right 2's+3's; this indicates failure to preserve original column gaps or incorrect left/right separation, possibly claiming right frames as left or vice versa; lower parts (e.g., row 13) matched better, but overall compression ignored central spacing; unknown why top 1's background was treated as frame.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_connected_frames acts as one and is essential; get_background is reliable.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though inner flood might over-merge if seeds connect unintended regions (potential bug in train 1/3 mismatches).
 * General issue: Program assumes fixed frame colors (8 left, 2 right), which worked for train 2 but may fail if colors vary (e.g., train 3 has 1 as bg, 2/8 frames); exclusion set prevents overlap but might skip shared inners.
 * Grouping correctly merges vertical overlaps but may create too-wide blocks if shapes touch diagonally (not an issue here, but subtle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have severe misalignment and over-compression, e.g., top rows (0-5) cram left 9's (likely bg) with right 2's+4's+3's shifted leftward, creating a dense left-packed mess instead of separated sides; middle (rows 7-12) has 8's frames with 1's/7's inners on left but trailed by 9's bg invading right space; bottom (rows 14-21) mixes 2's+6's+3's in a jumbled way with 8's appearing mid-right, suggesting failed left/right exclusion (e.g., row 16 has 8's in right block area) and incorrect delta_c shifts causing overlaps/clips; expected should preserve vertical blocks separately (e.g., top-right 2/4/3 block flush right, mid-left 8/1/7 block flush left, bottom mixed but separated), with clean bg fills—no such separation here, and colors like 9's bg not handled as output fill properly; this fails core separation, likely due to dynamic frame colors (test has 8/2 but bg=9) or seed/flood bugs pulling wrong inners.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 22:51:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid by identifying background (most common value), extracting connected "shapes" (non-background components) separately for left and right sides—left starting from cells marked 8 and flooding to all non-background, right starting from cells marked 2 and flooding to non-background excluding 8—and then regrouping these shapes into vertical "blocks" based on row overlap, compressing them horizontally by their bounding boxes, and placing left blocks aligned to the left edge and right blocks aligned to the right edge of a new output grid, while preserving vertical positions and overwriting background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common value in the flattened grid; everything else is part of shapes, but shapes must be extracted via flood fill from specific seeds (8 for left, 2 for right) to separate left/right components—do not assume all non-bg are shapes without seeding.
 * Flood fill uses 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right); shapes are sets of cells with their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for later placement.
 * Left extraction: Start from unvisited 8 cells, flood to any adjacent non-bg (this can accidentally include right shapes if they connect via non-bg paths to 8's, which seems to happen in some cases).
 * Right extraction: Start from unvisited 2 cells after left extraction (using shared visited set), flood only to non-bg and non-8; this excludes left shapes but may miss isolated right shapes if they don't start from 2 or if visited by left flood.
 * Grouping: Sort shapes by min row, then cluster into "blocks" where shapes overlap in row range (min_r of next <= max_r of current); within each block, sort by min col and place sequentially without gaps, shifting entire shapes horizontally to pack tightly.
 * Placement: Output starts as all bg; for left blocks, start at col 0 and add shape widths sequentially; for right blocks, start at col (n - total_block_width) and add leftward; rows stay absolute (no vertical shift); only place if new_col in bounds, but this can clip shapes.
 * Subtleties: Shared visited set prevents re-flooding, but left flood's broad condition (!= bg) can overgrab if components touch; right flood's exclusion of 8 prevents left overlap but may fragment shapes containing 2's near 8's. Bg may vary (0,1,9 across examples). Grids are square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). No diagonal connectivity. Shapes with only bg or empty after flood are skipped. Horizontal compression assumes no overlaps in block, but vertical stacking of blocks is implicit via per-block processing. Easy to miss: right shapes may include numbers like 1,3,4,5,6,9 if connected to 2; left includes 3,4,5,6 but not 2's directly. If a 2 is connected to 8 via non-bg, it gets grabbed as left, causing misalignment (seen in examples).
 * All non-seed cells (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,9) are treated as shape pixels with their original values; do not change values during extraction/placement.
 * Potential edge cases: Shapes spanning full width (no compression needed); isolated shapes; blocks with single shape; right shapes with varying widths; bg=0/1/9; grids where left/right touch via bg only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg, uses flood fill for shape extraction, groups into row-overlapping blocks, and performs horizontal compression/placement separately for left/right, which works fully for training example 2 (exact match, preserving all shapes like 3's,5's,6's in correct positions).
 * What worked: Shared visited prevents double-extraction; seeding from 8/2 separates sides; bounding box calculation enables compression; vertical positions preserved; one training example passes completely, showing core extraction/placement logic is sound when shapes are cleanly separated.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1 (INCORRECT), left flood overgrabs right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-4 shapes placed on left instead of right, like row 13 generated has 2's starting at col 2 on left vs. expected all 0's until col 12 with 2's on right; row 16 generated has 2-2-2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-6-6-6-2 on right with 4's shifted; row 17 generated has 2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-2-2-2-2-2-4-4-4-2; unknown if due to connection via non-bg path to 8, but it misplaces entire blocks).
 * In training example 1, upper parts match (e.g., 5's,3's,1's on right correct), but lower right 9's and 6's/4's are fragmented or shifted leftward, and row 13 has extra 2's on left not in expected (expected has uniform 2's on right).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), left shapes (8-2-3-6) are placed correctly in middle-left, but right shapes are underplaced or overwritten: e.g., row 0 generated all 1's (bg) vs. expected 2's on right (missing top 2-3-4 block); row 1 generated has 2-3-3-3-2 on left-middle vs. expected on right; row 16 generated 2-2-2-2-2 on right but 3's misplaced left; overall, right blocks start too far left (e.g., total_width miscalculated, placing at col ~10 instead of n-5).
 * extract_objects via flood_fill is essential and mostly correct, but left flood condition (!= bg) is too broad (should perhaps exclude 2's or use stricter connectivity to prevent bleed); right flood (!= bg and !=8) is better but fails if 2's are visited by left.
 * The group_and_place function is helpful for blocking/packing but buggy in right-side base_col calculation (uses n - total_width, but if blocks have varying widths or overlaps, it packs left-to-right within right block, causing leftward shift into center).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (Counter for bg, flood, group, place) are relevant, though flood needs tuning for separation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules and patterns from training examples; it follows the same logic (bg=9, left from 8 including 1/7, right from 2 including 3/4/6), but shows similar issues as incorrect trainings: e.g., upper right 2-4-3 shapes are placed correctly compressed on right (rows 1-5 match expected pattern of packing 4's then 3's), but lower left 8-1-7 placed on left ok, yet row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 on left-middle then 2-3-3-3-2 on right (suggests overgrab of a 2-6 shape into left block, like ex1); row 17 has 2-2-2-2-2 on left then 8-3-3-3-8-2-3-3-3-2, with 3's split across center (expected likely packs right block tighter to right edge without left bleed); row 8 has isolated 8-1-1-1-8 on left but 7's below shifted, and right all 9's (missing any right shapes there?); overall, compression works for isolated blocks but shared visited + broad left flood causes right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-3) to fragment or misalign leftward, not fully right-justified as in correct ex2—does not match clean separation expected, likely needs stricter flood conditions to handle test's denser connections (e.g., 2's near 8's in rows 15-20).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid rearrangement where connected non-background "objects" (blobs) are identified, grouped into horizontal blocks based on row overlap, and then repacked into a new grid: special objects (those containing the number 8) are placed on the left side, while non-special objects are placed on the right side, all within their respective blocks, preserving relative shapes and positions vertically but shifting horizontally for packing without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value in the grid (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 in ex3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only, no diagonals), found via DFS/stack traversal, tracking bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and presence of 8 (a marker for "special" or "framed" objects).
 * Components are sorted by starting position (min row, then min col) before grouping into blocks.
 * Blocks are formed by merging components whose row ranges overlap (if a component's min row <= current block's max row, add it and update max row); this creates horizontal "layers" of interacting objects.
 * Within each block, special (has8=True) components are packed left-aligned starting at col 0, sorted by min col, shifted right sequentially without gaps.
 * Non-special components are packed on the right, but positioning logic must account for block-specific context: if the original block's min col <9 (suggesting left-side origin), start at col 12; else right-align from n - total_width. This heuristic is flawed and leads to overlaps or misplacements.
 * Vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly; only horizontal shifts occur during packing.
 * Empty rows/cols in output are filled with background.
 * Subtle: 8 often forms "frames" around other numbers (e.g., outlining 5's in ex1, 2's in ex3), so components with 8 include the frame and interior; non-8 components are plain shapes.
 * Objects must not overlap in output, but shapes must remain intact (no rotation, scaling, or splitting).
 * Grid size n x n is fixed (22x22 in examples), and output must match exactly, including all details like isolated numbers or extensions (e.g., 1's protruding in ex1 expected).
 * Easy to miss: Some objects span multiple blocks if row overlaps chain; packing must handle variable widths and ensure right-side starts don't clip or gap incorrectly.
 * In ex1 expected, some non-special like 1's and 3's are packed right but with specific alignments (e.g., 1's under 2's frame); in ex3, top extensions of 1's into row 0 are missing in generated.
 * Test input has complex overlaps (e.g., 8-frames around 1's,4's,7's,3's; plain 2's,6's), so block grouping is critical to avoid scattering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and block grouping worked well, correctly identifying blobs, 8-presence, and row-overlap blocks (evident in ex2 passing fully).
 * Left-side packing for has8 components is accurate: in ex1 generated, the 5/8 frame packs correctly left; in ex3, 2/8 and 3/8 frames pack left properly.
 * Ex2 correct: All elements (frames and plains) packed into correct blocks and sides without misplacement, showing core detection/packing works for simple cases.
 * Ex1 incorrect: Right-side non-8 objects (3's,1's,2's) misplaced—generated packs 3's too far right (cols 11-14) and 1's absent/misaligned, while expected has 3's under extended 8-frame (cols 6-8) and 1's (cols 18-20) under 2-frame; also lower 2/6/4 blocks wrong (e.g., 6's not framed correctly, 4's shifted left).
 * Ex3 incorrect: Top row generated has mixed 1's/2's (cols 0-10 wrong), missing expected plain 1's extension; right-side 5's and 2's/6's mispacked (e.g., 5's start at col 13 but expected at col 12; lower 4/3/8 block has 4's too left, 3's not aligned under expected positions); unknown why top 1's blob isn't preserved as plain right-side.
 * Right-side packing logic broken: Heuristic "12 if minc<9 else n-total_w" fails for variable block origins—causes overlaps/gaps (e.g., ex1 3's overlap potential left space; ex3 5's gap from left block); doesn't sort/pack sequentially like left side.
 * No rotation or shape alteration, but attempts preserve cells correctly.
 * find_components is essential and accurate for extraction (use in future).
 * pack_side is helpful for left but needs fix for right (e.g., always calculate available space after left pack, or use fixed split like col 11).
 * group_into_blocks is solid but assumes sorted input; subtle miss: if blocks have no has8, all go right—ensure no empty left.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though right-pack heuristic is flawed (avoid as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It scatters elements oddly (e.g., top 9's background with 2/4's packed leftish but 8/4's intrude row3 col17-20 overlapping potential right; mid 1/8 frame at left but 7's inside shifted wrong; lower 6/2's and 3/8 mix left/right incorrectly, with 3's at col17-19 under 8 but expected likely right-aligned after left frames like 1/8 and 4/8).
 * Missing clean separation: Expected should have clear left frames (8-around-1,4,7,3) packed sequentially from col0 per block, rights (plain 2,6,4,3?) starting after (e.g., col11 or calculated), but generated has overlaps (e.g., row17 8/3 at col11-16 clashing with potential 2/3 right) and unframed 4's/3's misplaced.
 * Background 9's fill correctly, but shapes distorted by bad shifts (e.g., row4 4/8 at col17-20 should be part of right or separate block; unknown why 7's frame doesn't include full outline).
 * Does not match training patterns: Ex1/3 expect tight packing without col12 heuristic failures; test likely needs dynamic right-start (e.g., max left width + gap) to avoid this mess.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract "framed" shapes (outlined in specific colors like 8 for left-side objects and 2 for right-side objects) from a 22x22 grid, including their internal filled regions (non-background, non-frame colors), group these shapes into vertically contiguous "blocks" based on row overlap, and reassemble them into a new grid by placing left blocks flush left and right blocks flush right, while filling the rest with the background color. The process separates left and right objects to avoid overlap, preserving the relative horizontal ordering within blocks but compressing them to the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are identified as connected components (using 4-connectivity for the frame outline itself) of a specific color (8 for left, 2 for right), and their "inner" regions are flooded from 8-neighbor seeds adjacent to the frame (but using 4-connectivity for the flood fill), excluding background and frame cells; this captures enclosed or adjacent non-background content as part of the shape.
 * Shapes are treated as single units including both frame and inner cells; empty or background-only "shapes" are implicitly skipped since all_cells would be empty.
 * Grouping into blocks uses vertical sorting and merges components if their row ranges overlap (minr <= current maxr), creating horizontal strips of shapes; within each block, components are sorted left-to-right by minc and placed without gaps, but shifted to the left edge (for left blocks) or right edge (for right blocks) of the output grid.
 * Exclusion of already-used cells (from left when processing right) prevents double-claiming overlapping or shared elements; background is the most common color, and output starts filled with it.
 * Subtle connectivity: 4-dir for frame and inner flood ensures orthogonally connected blobs, but 8-dir seeds for inners allow detecting diagonally adjacent starts; this can miss thin diagonals or cause over-inclusion if not careful.
 * Placement shifts entire blocks by delta_c based on cumulative widths, but only copies if new_c is in bounds (0-21), potentially clipping edges; vertical positions (rows) are preserved from original.
 * Objects may span multiple rows/columns irregularly; right-side objects might have different frame colors or interleaving with left; inners can be multi-color but are copied as-is.
 * Potential misses: If a frame encloses multiple disconnected inners, the flood from multiple seeds might merge them incorrectly if they connect via 4-dir; background can appear inside frames but is excluded; no rotation or resizing—exact copy with horizontal compression per block.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; colors are integers 0-9, with 0 often background but varies (e.g., 1 in train 3).
 * All considerations: Avoid overwriting during placement (but code places sequentially, so left then right might overlap if blocks wide); handle cases where blocks don't fill full width; preserve exact cell values when copying; no vertical shifting or reordering blocks—order by original minr.

                if 0 <= new_c < n:
                    out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
            cum += widths[idx]
```
(Helpful for placing blocks: sorts comps left-to-right, computes cumulative shift to edge, copies cells with column delta while preserving rows; bounds check prevents out-of-grid writes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 2 entirely, demonstrating core extraction, grouping, and placement logic works for some cases with standard left/right separation and vertical blocks.
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output misplaced right-side elements, e.g., row 13 (0-based) has scattered 2's and misplaced 6's/4's instead of a full horizontal 2-bar connecting the bottom shapes; row 14 has 2's starting too left with 6's; row 15 has 8's and 4's shifted wrong, and bottom 4's/2's compressed incorrectly (e.g., row 17 has extra 2's where expected has 2's+4's aligned differently); this suggests over-shifting or incorrect width calculation in place_blocks for right blocks, or missing a connecting frame/bar in grouping; left side mostly matched but had minor inner placements off (e.g., row 2 has extra 0's where expected has none).
 * For training 3 (INCORRECT): Top row (row 0) generated full left 1's+2's where expected has partial 1's+right 2's starting mid-grid; row 1 has 8's+2's+3's shifted left with extra 1's, but expected has 8's then 1's then right 2's+3's; this indicates failure to preserve original column gaps or incorrect left/right separation, possibly claiming right frames as left or vice versa; lower parts (e.g., row 13) matched better, but overall compression ignored central spacing; unknown why top 1's background was treated as frame.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_connected_frames acts as one and is essential; get_background is reliable.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though inner flood might over-merge if seeds connect unintended regions (potential bug in train 1/3 mismatches).
 * General issue: Program assumes fixed frame colors (8 left, 2 right), which worked for train 2 but may fail if colors vary (e.g., train 3 has 1 as bg, 2/8 frames); exclusion set prevents overlap but might skip shared inners.
 * Grouping correctly merges vertical overlaps but may create too-wide blocks if shapes touch diagonally (not an issue here, but subtle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have severe misalignment and over-compression, e.g., top rows (0-5) cram left 9's (likely bg) with right 2's+4's+3's shifted leftward, creating a dense left-packed mess instead of separated sides; middle (rows 7-12) has 8's frames with 1's/7's inners on left but trailed by 9's bg invading right space; bottom (rows 14-21) mixes 2's+6's+3's in a jumbled way with 8's appearing mid-right, suggesting failed left/right exclusion (e.g., row 16 has 8's in right block area) and incorrect delta_c shifts causing overlaps/clips; expected should preserve vertical blocks separately (e.g., top-right 2/4/3 block flush right, mid-left 8/1/7 block flush left, bottom mixed but separated), with clean bg fills—no such separation here, and colors like 9's bg not handled as output fill properly; this fails core separation, likely due to dynamic frame colors (test has 8/2 but bg=9) or seed/flood bugs pulling wrong inners.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:

                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing a scene or diagram with background, connected "objects" (components), and special elements marked by 8 (likely indicators like "E" for emphasis or extraction). The goal is to rearrange these components into a new grid: "left" components (those containing 8) are stacked or aligned on the left side (columns 0+), while "right" components (without 8) are placed in fixed right-side positions (e.g., starting at columns 12 or 17), all on a background, preserving shapes and connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-way connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components containing at least one 8 are treated as "left" and must be placed in a vertically stacked manner on the left, sorted by top-left position (min row, then min column), with vertical gaps preserved (e.g., if a component starts below the previous one's max row +1, it starts a new "column" at 0; otherwise, it appends horizontally).
 * "Right" components (no 8) are placed rigidly: those originally in leftish positions (min column <=8) go to column 12; those in rightish positions (min column >8) go to column 17, without sorting or stacking—simple horizontal shift.
 * Preserve exact shapes: when placing, shift cells by delta columns (and rows if needed, but code assumes row-aligned), overwriting background only if new position is in bounds (0 to n-1); no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Subtle: Components may span multiple rows/columns; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement offsets. 8-cells are not special beyond flagging the component—copy them as-is.
 * Gaps in vertical stacking for left components: If a left component's min row > previous max row +1, reset horizontal position to column 0; else, continue from current width. This handles multi-level "scenes" but can misalign if sorting or gap logic fails.
 * Right placement is heuristic-based (threshold at column 8), assuming grid width ~22; may fail if components overlap post-shift or if original positions vary.
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting in DFS/BFS for components; flat Counter for background works but assumes no ties (most_common(1)). No handling for isolated 8s or components touching edges.
 * Overall: Output grid starts as all-background; placements don't merge or resolve overlaps (but code avoids by position choice). n=22 in examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as the mode; useful and correct across attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                cells: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                has_e = False
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS for component traversal
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    cells.append((x, y))
                    if g[x][y] == 8:
                        has_e = True
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append({
                    'cells': cells,
                    'minr': min_r,
                    'maxr': max_r,
                    'minc': min_c,
                    'maxc': max_c,
                    'has8': has_e
                })
    return components
```
(This extracts components correctly with bounding boxes and 8-flag; essential for separation and placement; DFS stack handles irregular shapes well.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    bg = get_background(g)
    all_comps = find_components(g, bg)
    left_comps = [c for c in all_comps if c['has8']]
    right_comps = [c for c in all_comps if not c['has8']]
    out = [[bg for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Placement functions called here (see below)
    return out
```
(Top-level structure is solid: separate by has8, init output as bg, place left then right.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified bg=1, extracted components, separated left (with 8) vs right, placed left stacked on cols 0+ with gap logic, right at fixed cols 12/17 based on original minc <=8 threshold, producing exact matches.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated output has misplaced left components—e.g., row 0 starts with five 2s then 1s (expected all 1s then five 2s at end); rows 1-4 have 2,3,3,3,2 + 8s in cols 5-9 but shifted wrong (expected 8s in cols 0-4, then 1s, with 2,3 in cols 17-21); bottom sections like rows 6-8 have 8,6 in cols 0-4 but expected 1s there with 6s shifted right; row 13 has 2,5 in cols 12-16 but expected 1s in cols 0-16 with 2,4 in 17-21—overall, left stacking ignores some vertical alignments/gaps, causing overlap or offset; right placements use fixed cols but threshold misclassifies some components (e.g., original minc >8 but placed at 12).
 * Sorting left_comps by (minr, minc) works for simple cases but fails when components have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential vertical positions in train 3, leading to horizontal crowding instead of proper stacking.
 * Gap logic in place_left_components (if minr > last_maxr +1, reset to col 0; else append to current_width) is partially correct but doesn't handle multi-column resets well, causing left components to bleed into mid-grid (e.g., 8s in cols 5-9 instead of 0-4).
 * Right placement heuristic (col 12 if minc<=8, else 17) works for train 1/2 but in train 3 shifts some right components too left (e.g., 3s/4s appear in cols 17-21 correctly in expected, but generated has them mixed with 2s/5s in cols 12-16); no vertical alignment for right, assuming row-preserved, but bounds check clips edges.
 * No overlaps resolved in placement (code just overwrites if in bounds), but train 3 generated shows no clipping issues—just misalignment.
 * Component extraction is accurate (finds all non-bg blobs with has8 flag), but separation assumes all 8-components are "left" without checking size/connectivity to 8.
 * Unhelpful: No rotation or shape validation functions (not needed, as placements preserve orientation). The current place_right_components is simplistic/heuristic and broken for variable component positions—don't reuse without dynamic col calculation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (plausible as most common); components extracted (e.g., 8s with 4s on left, 1s/7s mid, 2/3/5/6 rightish); left placements (with 8s) stacked in cols 0-4/11-16-ish but irregular—e.g., rows 3-7 have 8,4 in cols 0-4 (good), but row 8 has 8s scattered in cols 11-16 (unexpected shift); row 16 has 2,6,2,3 in cols 11-16 + 8s in 17-20 (mixes left/right logic).
 * Right components placed at ~cols 12-16 (for original leftish) and 17-21 (for rightish), e.g., 2,4 in rows 1-3 cols 12-16 (seems ok), 7s in rows 9-12 cols 12-16 (but original minc may >8, should be 17?), 3s/6s mixed in rows 15-20 cols 11-16/17-20—overlaps or wrong threshold cause 8s to appear in right area (row 20 cols 17-20), violating separation.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have clean left stack (all 8-components in cols 0-~10, vertically gapped, rows preserved); right in 12+ with no 8s leaking; e.g., top 2,4 blob should be right at col 12, bottom 3s at 17, mid 1/7 with 8 at left cols 0-4 rows 8-12. Generated has row 0 all 9s except 2s at 12-16 + end (minor shift ok?), but row 16's 8s in right (wrong—8s must be left); row 21 all 9s good. Overall, ~70% aligned but placement thresholds/gaps fail for dense/multi-level components, similar to train 3 error.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:02:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (objects) of specific colors (e.g., 8 for left-side elements, 2 for right-side elements) are extracted from an input grid, grouped into vertical "blocks" based on row proximity, and rearranged into an output grid with left blocks placed starting from column 0 and right blocks placed at dynamic starting columns (12 or 17) to form a composed image, while preserving the background color. The goal is to correctly position these blocks without overlap or misalignment, likely simulating a puzzle like assembling sprites or icons from a cluttered source into a clean layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most common cell value in the grid; all non-component cells in the output should be filled with this background (e.g., 1 in training example 3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are defined via flood fill (4-directional adjacency) only for cells matching a seed color (8 for left, 2 for right) and not equal to background; visited tracking prevents re-processing, but extraction must happen separately for left and right to avoid cross-contamination.
 * Components are grouped into "blocks" vertically using a row-overlap threshold (1 for left, -1 for right in this attempt, which may be asymmetric and cause issues); blocks are sorted by min row, and new blocks start if the next component's min row exceeds the current block's max row plus threshold.
 * Placement: Left blocks are placed sequentially from column 0, shifting each component right by (current placement column - its original min column) to pack horizontally without gaps; right blocks use a dynamic start column (12 if any component in block has minc < 9, else 17) to align with a "right panel" layout, but this heuristic fails when components span panel boundaries or have unexpected minc values.
 * Subtle element: Original positions (minc, maxc) influence placement deltas, but output must clip to grid bounds (0 to n-1, here n=22); overwriting is allowed but should not distort shapes—misplacement can cause partial overlaps or shifts (e.g., 2/3 blocks appearing on left in training 3).
 * Color preservation: All cell colors from source components must be copied exactly; no color changes or blending.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; assume square input/output.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side grouping uses negative threshold (-1), which may force tighter grouping than left (threshold 1), leading to over-merging; get_right_start logic assumes a "left panel" ends at col 8-9, but this breaks if components cross panels or if minc is misleading due to flood fill boundaries.
 * Flood fill must exclude background strictly, but include all connected non-bg cells of the seed color—wait, actually, the code flood-fills any non-bg from a seed start, which could pull in multi-color components if adjacent, but in examples, components seem mono-color; this might be a bug if puzzles have mixed-color blobs.
 * No rotation, scaling, or deletion—only translation and packing.
 * Considerations from attempts: Separate visited for left/right extraction to cover whole grid; sort blocks/components by rows/cols for consistent ordering; handle empty blocks gracefully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing components and filling output.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, visited: List[List[bool]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    cells = []
    stack = [(start_r, start_c)]
    visited[start_r][start_c] = True
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        cells.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(This is a standard iterative flood fill for extracting connected non-background regions starting from a seed cell; useful for isolating components, but note it grabs any non-bg adjacent cells, not just same color—may need color restriction for purity.)

```python
def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int, seed_color: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    comps = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] == seed_color and not visited[i][j]:
                cells = flood_fill(g, i, j, visited, bg, n)
                if cells:
                    rs = [r for r, _ in cells]
                    cs = [c for _, c in cells]
                    comps.append({
                        'cells': cells,
                        'minr': min(rs),
                        'maxr': max(rs),
                        'minc': min(cs),
                        'maxc': max(cs)
                    })
    return comps
```
(This extracts bounding boxes and cells for components starting with a seed color, using shared visited; helpful for left/right separation, but could be improved by per-extraction visited resets if needed.)

```python
def group_into_blocks(comps: List[Dict[str, int]], threshold: int) -> List[List[Dict[str, int]]]:
    if not comps:
        return []
    comps = sorted(comps, key=lambda c: c['minr'])
    blocks = []
    current_block = [comps[0]]
    cur_max_r = comps[0]['maxr']
    for comp in comps[1:]:
        if comp['minr'] <= cur_max_r + threshold:
            current_block.append(comp)
            cur_max_r = max(cur_max_r, comp['maxr'])
        else:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [comp]
            cur_max_r = comp['maxr']
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This groups components into row-based blocks with a proximity threshold; core for vertical organization, but threshold asymmetry (1 vs -1) in attempt may cause incorrect merging/splitting.)

```python
def place_block(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], block: List[Dict[str, int]], start_col: int, n: int):
    if not block:
        return
    block = sorted(block, key=lambda c: c['minc'])
    curr_col = start_col
    for comp in block:
        delta = curr_col - comp['minc']
        for r, c in comp['cells']:
            new_c = c + delta
            if 0 <= new_c < n:
                out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
        w = comp['maxc'] - comp['minc'] + 1
        curr_col += w
```
(This packs a block horizontally from a start column, preserving relative positions; essential for placement, but delta calculation assumes original minc is relative to a panel—fails if components are not panel-aligned.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely because their components had clean panel separation (minc >=9 for right) and simple vertical grouping, demonstrating core understanding of background detection, component extraction via flood fill, and basic left/right placement.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output has misplaced right-side elements (e.g., row 0 has 2-block at cols 5-9 instead of all 1s until col 17; row 1 has 2/3-block at cols 5-9 instead of 1s, and right 2/3-block starts at col 10 instead of 17), while left 8/2/3 shapes are partially correct but shifted right; expected has clean left panel (cols 0-16 mostly 1/8 with shapes) and right panel (cols 17-21 with 2/3/4/5 blocks)—difference due to get_right_start choosing 12 incorrectly (min_min_c <9 triggers early placement) and possibly over-merging blocks with threshold -1 pulling left/right components together.
 * What worked: Flood fill and extraction accurately captured component cells/bounds in train 3 (e.g., 8-shapes on left rows 1-5 match expected); grouping into blocks succeeded for most vertical stacking; output background fill is correct (all 1s where empty).
 * What didn't work: Right block placement starts too left (at 12 instead of 17), causing overlap/shift of 2/3/4/5 elements into mid-grid (e.g., row 1 expected 2/3 at 17-21, generated at 10-16? partial); negative threshold for right grouping may merge unrelated components vertically; no handling for multi-color components (flood fill grabs adjacent non-bg, but examples seem mono-color so okay); place_block delta doesn't account for panel offsets properly, leading to horizontal shifts.
 * extract_components is essential and worked well for isolating left (seed 8) and right (seed 2) without overlap via shared visited.
 * group_into_blocks is helpful but threshold tuning (1 for left, -1 for right) is subtle/broken—negative threshold forces all into fewer blocks if rows overlap slightly, possibly causing train 3 merge error.
 * get_right_start is an attempt at panel detection but unhelpful/broken: relies on arbitrary <9 check for "left spillover," fails when right components have low minc due to adjacency or irregular shapes (don't use as-is; needs better panel boundary logic, e.g., based on color density).
 * place_block is mostly correct but clips without error, potentially losing parts if delta pushes beyond n (not seen in train 3 but risk in test).
 * Overall problem understanding: Puzzle is about de-cluttering/reassembling left and right "sprites" into side-by-side panels, but subtle panel detection (e.g., col 0-11 left, 12-16? buffer, 17-21 right) and threshold symmetry are missed; no rotation or color mapping, just spatial rearrangement.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the program that failed training 3: e.g., right-side elements (2/3/4 blocks) appear shifted left (row 0 has 2-block at cols 12-16, but likely should be at 17-21 like train 3 expected; row 3 has 2/4/3 mixed starting col 12, overlapping what seems like a left buffer of 9s), and left-side 8/1/7 shapes are placed early (rows 7-12 cols 0-4 correct, but row 6 has 8/2/3 at cols 16-21 which may be right spillover).
 * Background 9 is filled correctly in empties, and some components like 6 in rows 14-17 cols 6-8 look well-extracted/placed, but overall layout has mid-grid clutter (e.g., row 16 has 2/3 at cols 12-16, not pushed right), suggesting get_right_start triggered 12 due to minc <9 on some right component, causing panel overlap—does not match expected clean left (cols 0-11?), buffer, right (17-21) structure inferred from train 3.
 * Test has more colors (9 bg, 8/1 left?, 2/4/6/7/3 right?), and shapes seem vertically grouped (e.g., 2/4/3 stack in rows 1-5 cols 12+), but horizontal packing shifts them leftward incorrectly; no obvious clipping losses, but the entire right panel feels compressed into cols 12-21 instead of 17-21, leaving uneven 9s on far right.
 * To handle test, need to fix right start to always 17 unless specific spillover, and use uniform threshold (e.g., 0 or 1) to avoid over-merging; output makes partial sense (components preserved) but violates panel separation, so incorrect.

[2025-10-02 23:02:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid by identifying background (most common value), extracting connected "shapes" (non-background components) separately for left and right sides—left starting from cells marked 8 and flooding to all non-background, right starting from cells marked 2 and flooding to non-background excluding 8—and then regrouping these shapes into vertical "blocks" based on row overlap, compressing them horizontally by their bounding boxes, and placing left blocks aligned to the left edge and right blocks aligned to the right edge of a new output grid, while preserving vertical positions and overwriting background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common value in the flattened grid; everything else is part of shapes, but shapes must be extracted via flood fill from specific seeds (8 for left, 2 for right) to separate left/right components—do not assume all non-bg are shapes without seeding.
 * Flood fill uses 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right); shapes are sets of cells with their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for later placement.
 * Left extraction: Start from unvisited 8 cells, flood to any adjacent non-bg (this can accidentally include right shapes if they connect via non-bg paths to 8's, which seems to happen in some cases).
 * Right extraction: Start from unvisited 2 cells after left extraction (using shared visited set), flood only to non-bg and non-8; this excludes left shapes but may miss isolated right shapes if they don't start from 2 or if visited by left flood.
 * Grouping: Sort shapes by min row, then cluster into "blocks" where shapes overlap in row range (min_r of next <= max_r of current); within each block, sort by min col and place sequentially without gaps, shifting entire shapes horizontally to pack tightly.
 * Placement: Output starts as all bg; for left blocks, start at col 0 and add shape widths sequentially; for right blocks, start at col (n - total_block_width) and add leftward; rows stay absolute (no vertical shift); only place if new_col in bounds, but this can clip shapes.
 * Subtleties: Shared visited set prevents re-flooding, but left flood's broad condition (!= bg) can overgrab if components touch; right flood's exclusion of 8 prevents left overlap but may fragment shapes containing 2's near 8's. Bg may vary (0,1,9 across examples). Grids are square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). No diagonal connectivity. Shapes with only bg or empty after flood are skipped. Horizontal compression assumes no overlaps in block, but vertical stacking of blocks is implicit via per-block processing. Easy to miss: right shapes may include numbers like 1,3,4,5,6,9 if connected to 2; left includes 3,4,5,6 but not 2's directly. If a 2 is connected to 8 via non-bg, it gets grabbed as left, causing misalignment (seen in examples).
 * All non-seed cells (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,9) are treated as shape pixels with their original values; do not change values during extraction/placement.
 * Potential edge cases: Shapes spanning full width (no compression needed); isolated shapes; blocks with single shape; right shapes with varying widths; bg=0/1/9; grids where left/right touch via bg only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg, uses flood fill for shape extraction, groups into row-overlapping blocks, and performs horizontal compression/placement separately for left/right, which works fully for training example 2 (exact match, preserving all shapes like 3's,5's,6's in correct positions).
 * What worked: Shared visited prevents double-extraction; seeding from 8/2 separates sides; bounding box calculation enables compression; vertical positions preserved; one training example passes completely, showing core extraction/placement logic is sound when shapes are cleanly separated.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1 (INCORRECT), left flood overgrabs right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-4 shapes placed on left instead of right, like row 13 generated has 2's starting at col 2 on left vs. expected all 0's until col 12 with 2's on right; row 16 generated has 2-2-2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-6-6-6-2 on right with 4's shifted; row 17 generated has 2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-2-2-2-2-2-4-4-4-2; unknown if due to connection via non-bg path to 8, but it misplaces entire blocks).
 * In training example 1, upper parts match (e.g., 5's,3's,1's on right correct), but lower right 9's and 6's/4's are fragmented or shifted leftward, and row 13 has extra 2's on left not in expected (expected has uniform 2's on right).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), left shapes (8-2-3-6) are placed correctly in middle-left, but right shapes are underplaced or overwritten: e.g., row 0 generated all 1's (bg) vs. expected 2's on right (missing top 2-3-4 block); row 1 generated has 2-3-3-3-2 on left-middle vs. expected on right; row 16 generated 2-2-2-2-2 on right but 3's misplaced left; overall, right blocks start too far left (e.g., total_width miscalculated, placing at col ~10 instead of n-5).
 * extract_objects via flood_fill is essential and mostly correct, but left flood condition (!= bg) is too broad (should perhaps exclude 2's or use stricter connectivity to prevent bleed); right flood (!= bg and !=8) is better but fails if 2's are visited by left.
 * The group_and_place function is helpful for blocking/packing but buggy in right-side base_col calculation (uses n - total_width, but if blocks have varying widths or overlaps, it packs left-to-right within right block, causing leftward shift into center).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (Counter for bg, flood, group, place) are relevant, though flood needs tuning for separation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules and patterns from training examples; it follows the same logic (bg=9, left from 8 including 1/7, right from 2 including 3/4/6), but shows similar issues as incorrect trainings: e.g., upper right 2-4-3 shapes are placed correctly compressed on right (rows 1-5 match expected pattern of packing 4's then 3's), but lower left 8-1-7 placed on left ok, yet row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 on left-middle then 2-3-3-3-2 on right (suggests overgrab of a 2-6 shape into left block, like ex1); row 17 has 2-2-2-2-2 on left then 8-3-3-3-8-2-3-3-3-2, with 3's split across center (expected likely packs right block tighter to right edge without left bleed); row 8 has isolated 8-1-1-1-8 on left but 7's below shifted, and right all 9's (missing any right shapes there?); overall, compression works for isolated blocks but shared visited + broad left flood causes right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-3) to fragment or misalign leftward, not fully right-justified as in correct ex2—does not match clean separation expected, likely needs stricter flood conditions to handle test's denser connections (e.g., 2's near 8's in rows 15-20).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid rearrangement where connected non-background "objects" (blobs) are identified, grouped into horizontal blocks based on row overlap, and then repacked into a new grid: special objects (those containing the number 8) are placed on the left side, while non-special objects are placed on the right side, all within their respective blocks, preserving relative shapes and positions vertically but shifting horizontally for packing without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value in the grid (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 in ex3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only, no diagonals), found via DFS/stack traversal, tracking bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and presence of 8 (a marker for "special" or "framed" objects).
 * Components are sorted by starting position (min row, then min col) before grouping into blocks.
 * Blocks are formed by merging components whose row ranges overlap (if a component's min row <= current block's max row, add it and update max row); this creates horizontal "layers" of interacting objects.
 * Within each block, special (has8=True) components are packed left-aligned starting at col 0, sorted by min col, shifted right sequentially without gaps.
 * Non-special components are packed on the right, but positioning logic must account for block-specific context: if the original block's min col <9 (suggesting left-side origin), start at col 12; else right-align from n - total_width. This heuristic is flawed and leads to overlaps or misplacements.
 * Vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly; only horizontal shifts occur during packing.
 * Empty rows/cols in output are filled with background.
 * Subtle: 8 often forms "frames" around other numbers (e.g., outlining 5's in ex1, 2's in ex3), so components with 8 include the frame and interior; non-8 components are plain shapes.
 * Objects must not overlap in output, but shapes must remain intact (no rotation, scaling, or splitting).
 * Grid size n x n is fixed (22x22 in examples), and output must match exactly, including all details like isolated numbers or extensions (e.g., 1's protruding in ex1 expected).
 * Easy to miss: Some objects span multiple blocks if row overlaps chain; packing must handle variable widths and ensure right-side starts don't clip or gap incorrectly.
 * In ex1 expected, some non-special like 1's and 3's are packed right but with specific alignments (e.g., 1's under 2's frame); in ex3, top extensions of 1's into row 0 are missing in generated.
 * Test input has complex overlaps (e.g., 8-frames around 1's,4's,7's,3's; plain 2's,6's), so block grouping is critical to avoid scattering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and block grouping worked well, correctly identifying blobs, 8-presence, and row-overlap blocks (evident in ex2 passing fully).
 * Left-side packing for has8 components is accurate: in ex1 generated, the 5/8 frame packs correctly left; in ex3, 2/8 and 3/8 frames pack left properly.
 * Ex2 correct: All elements (frames and plains) packed into correct blocks and sides without misplacement, showing core detection/packing works for simple cases.
 * Ex1 incorrect: Right-side non-8 objects (3's,1's,2's) misplaced—generated packs 3's too far right (cols 11-14) and 1's absent/misaligned, while expected has 3's under extended 8-frame (cols 6-8) and 1's (cols 18-20) under 2-frame; also lower 2/6/4 blocks wrong (e.g., 6's not framed correctly, 4's shifted left).
 * Ex3 incorrect: Top row generated has mixed 1's/2's (cols 0-10 wrong), missing expected plain 1's extension; right-side 5's and 2's/6's mispacked (e.g., 5's start at col 13 but expected at col 12; lower 4/3/8 block has 4's too left, 3's not aligned under expected positions); unknown why top 1's blob isn't preserved as plain right-side.
 * Right-side packing logic broken: Heuristic "12 if minc<9 else n-total_w" fails for variable block origins—causes overlaps/gaps (e.g., ex1 3's overlap potential left space; ex3 5's gap from left block); doesn't sort/pack sequentially like left side.
 * No rotation or shape alteration, but attempts preserve cells correctly.
 * find_components is essential and accurate for extraction (use in future).
 * pack_side is helpful for left but needs fix for right (e.g., always calculate available space after left pack, or use fixed split like col 11).
 * group_into_blocks is solid but assumes sorted input; subtle miss: if blocks have no has8, all go right—ensure no empty left.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though right-pack heuristic is flawed (avoid as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It scatters elements oddly (e.g., top 9's background with 2/4's packed leftish but 8/4's intrude row3 col17-20 overlapping potential right; mid 1/8 frame at left but 7's inside shifted wrong; lower 6/2's and 3/8 mix left/right incorrectly, with 3's at col17-19 under 8 but expected likely right-aligned after left frames like 1/8 and 4/8).
 * Missing clean separation: Expected should have clear left frames (8-around-1,4,7,3) packed sequentially from col0 per block, rights (plain 2,6,4,3?) starting after (e.g., col11 or calculated), but generated has overlaps (e.g., row17 8/3 at col11-16 clashing with potential 2/3 right) and unframed 4's/3's misplaced.
 * Background 9's fill correctly, but shapes distorted by bad shifts (e.g., row4 4/8 at col17-20 should be part of right or separate block; unknown why 7's frame doesn't include full outline).
 * Does not match training patterns: Ex1/3 expect tight packing without col12 heuristic failures; test likely needs dynamic right-start (e.g., max left width + gap) to avoid this mess.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract "framed" shapes (outlined in specific colors like 8 for left-side objects and 2 for right-side objects) from a 22x22 grid, including their internal filled regions (non-background, non-frame colors), group these shapes into vertically contiguous "blocks" based on row overlap, and reassemble them into a new grid by placing left blocks flush left and right blocks flush right, while filling the rest with the background color. The process separates left and right objects to avoid overlap, preserving the relative horizontal ordering within blocks but compressing them to the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are identified as connected components (using 4-connectivity for the frame outline itself) of a specific color (8 for left, 2 for right), and their "inner" regions are flooded from 8-neighbor seeds adjacent to the frame (but using 4-connectivity for the flood fill), excluding background and frame cells; this captures enclosed or adjacent non-background content as part of the shape.
 * Shapes are treated as single units including both frame and inner cells; empty or background-only "shapes" are implicitly skipped since all_cells would be empty.
 * Grouping into blocks uses vertical sorting and merges components if their row ranges overlap (minr <= current maxr), creating horizontal strips of shapes; within each block, components are sorted left-to-right by minc and placed without gaps, but shifted to the left edge (for left blocks) or right edge (for right blocks) of the output grid.
 * Exclusion of already-used cells (from left when processing right) prevents double-claiming overlapping or shared elements; background is the most common color, and output starts filled with it.
 * Subtle connectivity: 4-dir for frame and inner flood ensures orthogonally connected blobs, but 8-dir seeds for inners allow detecting diagonally adjacent starts; this can miss thin diagonals or cause over-inclusion if not careful.
 * Placement shifts entire blocks by delta_c based on cumulative widths, but only copies if new_c is in bounds (0-21), potentially clipping edges; vertical positions (rows) are preserved from original.
 * Objects may span multiple rows/columns irregularly; right-side objects might have different frame colors or interleaving with left; inners can be multi-color but are copied as-is.
 * Potential misses: If a frame encloses multiple disconnected inners, the flood from multiple seeds might merge them incorrectly if they connect via 4-dir; background can appear inside frames but is excluded; no rotation or resizing—exact copy with horizontal compression per block.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; colors are integers 0-9, with 0 often background but varies (e.g., 1 in train 3).
 * All considerations: Avoid overwriting during placement (but code places sequentially, so left then right might overlap if blocks wide); handle cases where blocks don't fill full width; preserve exact cell values when copying; no vertical shifting or reordering blocks—order by original minr.

(This is core and helpful for extracting frame+inner shapes with proper connectivity and exclusion; returns bounding boxes and cells for grouping/placement.)

```python
def group_components(comps: List[Dict]) -> List[List[Dict]]:
    if not comps:
        return []
    comps = sorted(comps, key=lambda d: d['minr'])
    blocks: List[List[Dict]] = []
    current_block = [comps[0]]
    cur_max_r = comps[0]['maxr']
    for comp in comps[1:]:
        if comp['minr'] <= cur_max_r:
            current_block.append(comp)
            cur_max_r = max(cur_max_r, comp['maxr'])
        else:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [comp]
            cur_max_r = comp['maxr']
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(Helpful for vertically grouping overlapping shapes into blocks; sorts by minr and merges on row overlap.)

```python
def place_blocks(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], blocks: List[List[Dict]], is_left: bool):
    n = 22
    for block in blocks:
        if not block:
            continue
        block_comps = sorted(block, key=lambda d: d['minc'])
        widths = [d['maxc'] - d['minc'] + 1 for d in block_comps]
        total_w = sum(widths)
        b_start = 0 if is_left else n - total_w
        cum = 0
        for idx, comp in enumerate(block_comps):
            delta_c = b_start + cum - comp['minc']
            for r, c in comp['all_cells']:
                new_c = c + delta_c
                if 0 <= new_c < n:
                    out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
            cum += widths[idx]
```
(Helpful for placing blocks: sorts comps left-to-right, computes cumulative shift to edge, copies cells with column delta while preserving rows; bounds check prevents out-of-grid writes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 2 entirely, demonstrating core extraction, grouping, and placement logic works for some cases with standard left/right separation and vertical blocks.
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output misplaced right-side elements, e.g., row 13 (0-based) has scattered 2's and misplaced 6's/4's instead of a full horizontal 2-bar connecting the bottom shapes; row 14 has 2's starting too left with 6's; row 15 has 8's and 4's shifted wrong, and bottom 4's/2's compressed incorrectly (e.g., row 17 has extra 2's where expected has 2's+4's aligned differently); this suggests over-shifting or incorrect width calculation in place_blocks for right blocks, or missing a connecting frame/bar in grouping; left side mostly matched but had minor inner placements off (e.g., row 2 has extra 0's where expected has none).
 * For training 3 (INCORRECT): Top row (row 0) generated full left 1's+2's where expected has partial 1's+right 2's starting mid-grid; row 1 has 8's+2's+3's shifted left with extra 1's, but expected has 8's then 1's then right 2's+3's; this indicates failure to preserve original column gaps or incorrect left/right separation, possibly claiming right frames as left or vice versa; lower parts (e.g., row 13) matched better, but overall compression ignored central spacing; unknown why top 1's background was treated as frame.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_connected_frames acts as one and is essential; get_background is reliable.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though inner flood might over-merge if seeds connect unintended regions (potential bug in train 1/3 mismatches).
 * General issue: Program assumes fixed frame colors (8 left, 2 right), which worked for train 2 but may fail if colors vary (e.g., train 3 has 1 as bg, 2/8 frames); exclusion set prevents overlap but might skip shared inners.
 * Grouping correctly merges vertical overlaps but may create too-wide blocks if shapes touch diagonally (not an issue here, but subtle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have severe misalignment and over-compression, e.g., top rows (0-5) cram left 9's (likely bg) with right 2's+4's+3's shifted leftward, creating a dense left-packed mess instead of separated sides; middle (rows 7-12) has 8's frames with 1's/7's inners on left but trailed by 9's bg invading right space; bottom (rows 14-21) mixes 2's+6's+3's in a jumbled way with 8's appearing mid-right, suggesting failed left/right exclusion (e.g., row 16 has 8's in right block area) and incorrect delta_c shifts causing overlaps/clips; expected should preserve vertical blocks separately (e.g., top-right 2/4/3 block flush right, mid-left 8/1/7 block flush left, bottom mixed but separated), with clean bg fills—no such separation here, and colors like 9's bg not handled as output fill properly; this fails core separation, likely due to dynamic frame colors (test has 8/2 but bg=9) or seed/flood bugs pulling wrong inners.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

```python
def find_shapes(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, background: int, opposite_frame: int, eight_cells: set = None) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    shapes = []
    visited = [[False] * 22 for _ in range(22)]
    for i in range(22):
        for j in range(22):
            if g[i][j] == frame_color and not visited[i][j] and (eight_cells is None or (i, j) not in eight_cells):

                q = deque([(i, j)])

                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == frame_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            frame_cells.append((nx, ny))
                inner_cells = set()
                for x, y in frame_cells:
                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                                continue
                            nx = x + dx
                            ny = y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < 22 and 0 <= ny < 22 and (nx, ny) not in inner_cells and g[nx][ny] != background and g[nx][ny] != opposite_frame and g[nx][ny] != frame_color:
                                inner_cells.add((nx, ny))
                all_cells = frame_cells + list(inner_cells)
                if all_cells:
                    minr = min(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    maxr = max(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    minc = min(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    maxc = max(y for _, y in all_cells)
                    shapes.append({'minr': minr, 'maxr': maxr, 'minc': minc, 'maxc': maxc})
    return shapes
```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

def place_left_shapes(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], background: int, shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]):
    current_left_width = 0

    for sh in shapes:
        minr = sh['minr']
        maxr = sh['maxr']

        w = maxc - minc + 1
        if minr > last_maxr_left + 1:
            proposed_left = 0
        else:
            proposed_left = current_left_width
        # place (assume no conflict)
        for rr in range(minr, maxr + 1):
            for kk in range(w):
                oc = proposed_left + kk
                if oc < 22:
                    nv = g[rr][minc + kk]

        current_left_width = max(current_left_width, proposed_left + w)
        last_maxr_left = maxr
```
(This handles left stacking with vertical block detection; works for non-overlapping left placements but assumes no conflicts—fine for 8-shapes as they go first.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]

(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:

                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))

                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))

        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing a scene or diagram with background, connected "objects" (components), and special elements marked by 8 (likely indicators like "E" for emphasis or extraction). The goal is to rearrange these components into a new grid: "left" components (those containing 8) are stacked or aligned on the left side (columns 0+), while "right" components (without 8) are placed in fixed right-side positions (e.g., starting at columns 12 or 17), all on a background, preserving shapes and connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-way connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components containing at least one 8 are treated as "left" and must be placed in a vertically stacked manner on the left, sorted by top-left position (min row, then min column), with vertical gaps preserved (e.g., if a component starts below the previous one's max row +1, it starts a new "column" at 0; otherwise, it appends horizontally).
 * "Right" components (no 8) are placed rigidly: those originally in leftish positions (min column <=8) go to column 12; those in rightish positions (min column >8) go to column 17, without sorting or stacking—simple horizontal shift.
 * Preserve exact shapes: when placing, shift cells by delta columns (and rows if needed, but code assumes row-aligned), overwriting background only if new position is in bounds (0 to n-1); no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Subtle: Components may span multiple rows/columns; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement offsets. 8-cells are not special beyond flagging the component—copy them as-is.
 * Gaps in vertical stacking for left components: If a left component's min row > previous max row +1, reset horizontal position to column 0; else, continue from current width. This handles multi-level "scenes" but can misalign if sorting or gap logic fails.
 * Right placement is heuristic-based (threshold at column 8), assuming grid width ~22; may fail if components overlap post-shift or if original positions vary.
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting in DFS/BFS for components; flat Counter for background works but assumes no ties (most_common(1)). No handling for isolated 8s or components touching edges.
 * Overall: Output grid starts as all-background; placements don't merge or resolve overlaps (but code avoids by position choice). n=22 in examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as the mode; useful and correct across attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                cells: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                has_e = False
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS for component traversal
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    cells.append((x, y))
                    if g[x][y] == 8:
                        has_e = True
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append({
                    'cells': cells,
                    'minr': min_r,
                    'maxr': max_r,
                    'minc': min_c,
                    'maxc': max_c,
                    'has8': has_e
                })
    return components
```
(This extracts components correctly with bounding boxes and 8-flag; essential for separation and placement; DFS stack handles irregular shapes well.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    bg = get_background(g)
    all_comps = find_components(g, bg)
    left_comps = [c for c in all_comps if c['has8']]
    right_comps = [c for c in all_comps if not c['has8']]
    out = [[bg for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Placement functions called here (see below)
    return out
```
(Top-level structure is solid: separate by has8, init output as bg, place left then right.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified bg=1, extracted components, separated left (with 8) vs right, placed left stacked on cols 0+ with gap logic, right at fixed cols 12/17 based on original minc <=8 threshold, producing exact matches.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated output has misplaced left components—e.g., row 0 starts with five 2s then 1s (expected all 1s then five 2s at end); rows 1-4 have 2,3,3,3,2 + 8s in cols 5-9 but shifted wrong (expected 8s in cols 0-4, then 1s, with 2,3 in cols 17-21); bottom sections like rows 6-8 have 8,6 in cols 0-4 but expected 1s there with 6s shifted right; row 13 has 2,5 in cols 12-16 but expected 1s in cols 0-16 with 2,4 in 17-21—overall, left stacking ignores some vertical alignments/gaps, causing overlap or offset; right placements use fixed cols but threshold misclassifies some components (e.g., original minc >8 but placed at 12).
 * Sorting left_comps by (minr, minc) works for simple cases but fails when components have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential vertical positions in train 3, leading to horizontal crowding instead of proper stacking.
 * Gap logic in place_left_components (if minr > last_maxr +1, reset to col 0; else append to current_width) is partially correct but doesn't handle multi-column resets well, causing left components to bleed into mid-grid (e.g., 8s in cols 5-9 instead of 0-4).
 * Right placement heuristic (col 12 if minc<=8, else 17) works for train 1/2 but in train 3 shifts some right components too left (e.g., 3s/4s appear in cols 17-21 correctly in expected, but generated has them mixed with 2s/5s in cols 12-16); no vertical alignment for right, assuming row-preserved, but bounds check clips edges.
 * No overlaps resolved in placement (code just overwrites if in bounds), but train 3 generated shows no clipping issues—just misalignment.
 * Component extraction is accurate (finds all non-bg blobs with has8 flag), but separation assumes all 8-components are "left" without checking size/connectivity to 8.
 * Unhelpful: No rotation or shape validation functions (not needed, as placements preserve orientation). The current place_right_components is simplistic/heuristic and broken for variable component positions—don't reuse without dynamic col calculation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (plausible as most common); components extracted (e.g., 8s with 4s on left, 1s/7s mid, 2/3/5/6 rightish); left placements (with 8s) stacked in cols 0-4/11-16-ish but irregular—e.g., rows 3-7 have 8,4 in cols 0-4 (good), but row 8 has 8s scattered in cols 11-16 (unexpected shift); row 16 has 2,6,2,3 in cols 11-16 + 8s in 17-20 (mixes left/right logic).
 * Right components placed at ~cols 12-16 (for original leftish) and 17-21 (for rightish), e.g., 2,4 in rows 1-3 cols 12-16 (seems ok), 7s in rows 9-12 cols 12-16 (but original minc may >8, should be 17?), 3s/6s mixed in rows 15-20 cols 11-16/17-20—overlaps or wrong threshold cause 8s to appear in right area (row 20 cols 17-20), violating separation.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have clean left stack (all 8-components in cols 0-~10, vertically gapped, rows preserved); right in 12+ with no 8s leaking; e.g., top 2,4 blob should be right at col 12, bottom 3s at 17, mid 1/7 with 8 at left cols 0-4 rows 8-12. Generated has row 0 all 9s except 2s at 12-16 + end (minor shift ok?), but row 16's 8s in right (wrong—8s must be left); row 21 all 9s good. Overall, ~70% aligned but placement thresholds/gaps fail for dense/multi-level components, similar to train 3 error.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (objects) of specific colors (e.g., 8 for left-side elements, 2 for right-side elements) are extracted from an input grid, grouped into vertical "blocks" based on row proximity, and rearranged into an output grid with left blocks placed starting from column 0 and right blocks placed at dynamic starting columns (12 or 17) to form a composed image, while preserving the background color. The goal is to correctly position these blocks without overlap or misalignment, likely simulating a puzzle like assembling sprites or icons from a cluttered source into a clean layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most common cell value in the grid; all non-component cells in the output should be filled with this background (e.g., 1 in training example 3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are defined via flood fill (4-directional adjacency) only for cells matching a seed color (8 for left, 2 for right) and not equal to background; visited tracking prevents re-processing, but extraction must happen separately for left and right to avoid cross-contamination.
 * Components are grouped into "blocks" vertically using a row-overlap threshold (1 for left, -1 for right in this attempt, which may be asymmetric and cause issues); blocks are sorted by min row, and new blocks start if the next component's min row exceeds the current block's max row plus threshold.
 * Placement: Left blocks are placed sequentially from column 0, shifting each component right by (current placement column - its original min column) to pack horizontally without gaps; right blocks use a dynamic start column (12 if any component in block has minc < 9, else 17) to align with a "right panel" layout, but this heuristic fails when components span panel boundaries or have unexpected minc values.
 * Subtle element: Original positions (minc, maxc) influence placement deltas, but output must clip to grid bounds (0 to n-1, here n=22); overwriting is allowed but should not distort shapes—misplacement can cause partial overlaps or shifts (e.g., 2/3 blocks appearing on left in training 3).
 * Color preservation: All cell colors from source components must be copied exactly; no color changes or blending.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; assume square input/output.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side grouping uses negative threshold (-1), which may force tighter grouping than left (threshold 1), leading to over-merging; get_right_start logic assumes a "left panel" ends at col 8-9, but this breaks if components cross panels or if minc is misleading due to flood fill boundaries.
 * Flood fill must exclude background strictly, but include all connected non-bg cells of the seed color—wait, actually, the code flood-fills any non-bg from a seed start, which could pull in multi-color components if adjacent, but in examples, components seem mono-color; this might be a bug if puzzles have mixed-color blobs.
 * No rotation, scaling, or deletion—only translation and packing.
 * Considerations from attempts: Separate visited for left/right extraction to cover whole grid; sort blocks/components by rows/cols for consistent ordering; handle empty blocks gracefully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing components and filling output.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, visited: List[List[bool]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    cells = []
    stack = [(start_r, start_c)]
    visited[start_r][start_c] = True
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        cells.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(This is a standard iterative flood fill for extracting connected non-background regions starting from a seed cell; useful for isolating components, but note it grabs any non-bg adjacent cells, not just same color—may need color restriction for purity.)

```python
def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int, seed_color: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    comps = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] == seed_color and not visited[i][j]:
                cells = flood_fill(g, i, j, visited, bg, n)
                if cells:
                    rs = [r for r, _ in cells]
                    cs = [c for _, c in cells]
                    comps.append({
                        'cells': cells,
                        'minr': min(rs),
                        'maxr': max(rs),
                        'minc': min(cs),
                        'maxc': max(cs)
                    })
    return comps
```
(This extracts bounding boxes and cells for components starting with a seed color, using shared visited; helpful for left/right separation, but could be improved by per-extraction visited resets if needed.)

```python
def group_into_blocks(comps: List[Dict[str, int]], threshold: int) -> List[List[Dict[str, int]]]:
    if not comps:
        return []
    comps = sorted(comps, key=lambda c: c['minr'])
    blocks = []
    current_block = [comps[0]]
    cur_max_r = comps[0]['maxr']
    for comp in comps[1:]:
        if comp['minr'] <= cur_max_r + threshold:
            current_block.append(comp)
            cur_max_r = max(cur_max_r, comp['maxr'])
        else:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [comp]
            cur_max_r = comp['maxr']
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This groups components into row-based blocks with a proximity threshold; core for vertical organization, but threshold asymmetry (1 vs -1) in attempt may cause incorrect merging/splitting.)

```python
def place_block(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], block: List[Dict[str, int]], start_col: int, n: int):
    if not block:
        return
    block = sorted(block, key=lambda c: c['minc'])
    curr_col = start_col
    for comp in block:
        delta = curr_col - comp['minc']
        for r, c in comp['cells']:
            new_c = c + delta
            if 0 <= new_c < n:
                out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
        w = comp['maxc'] - comp['minc'] + 1
        curr_col += w
```
(This packs a block horizontally from a start column, preserving relative positions; essential for placement, but delta calculation assumes original minc is relative to a panel—fails if components are not panel-aligned.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely because their components had clean panel separation (minc >=9 for right) and simple vertical grouping, demonstrating core understanding of background detection, component extraction via flood fill, and basic left/right placement.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output has misplaced right-side elements (e.g., row 0 has 2-block at cols 5-9 instead of all 1s until col 17; row 1 has 2/3-block at cols 5-9 instead of 1s, and right 2/3-block starts at col 10 instead of 17), while left 8/2/3 shapes are partially correct but shifted right; expected has clean left panel (cols 0-16 mostly 1/8 with shapes) and right panel (cols 17-21 with 2/3/4/5 blocks)—difference due to get_right_start choosing 12 incorrectly (min_min_c <9 triggers early placement) and possibly over-merging blocks with threshold -1 pulling left/right components together.
 * What worked: Flood fill and extraction accurately captured component cells/bounds in train 3 (e.g., 8-shapes on left rows 1-5 match expected); grouping into blocks succeeded for most vertical stacking; output background fill is correct (all 1s where empty).
 * What didn't work: Right block placement starts too left (at 12 instead of 17), causing overlap/shift of 2/3/4/5 elements into mid-grid (e.g., row 1 expected 2/3 at 17-21, generated at 10-16? partial); negative threshold for right grouping may merge unrelated components vertically; no handling for multi-color components (flood fill grabs adjacent non-bg, but examples seem mono-color so okay); place_block delta doesn't account for panel offsets properly, leading to horizontal shifts.
 * extract_components is essential and worked well for isolating left (seed 8) and right (seed 2) without overlap via shared visited.
 * group_into_blocks is helpful but threshold tuning (1 for left, -1 for right) is subtle/broken—negative threshold forces all into fewer blocks if rows overlap slightly, possibly causing train 3 merge error.
 * get_right_start is an attempt at panel detection but unhelpful/broken: relies on arbitrary <9 check for "left spillover," fails when right components have low minc due to adjacency or irregular shapes (don't use as-is; needs better panel boundary logic, e.g., based on color density).
 * place_block is mostly correct but clips without error, potentially losing parts if delta pushes beyond n (not seen in train 3 but risk in test).
 * Overall problem understanding: Puzzle is about de-cluttering/reassembling left and right "sprites" into side-by-side panels, but subtle panel detection (e.g., col 0-11 left, 12-16? buffer, 17-21 right) and threshold symmetry are missed; no rotation or color mapping, just spatial rearrangement.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the program that failed training 3: e.g., right-side elements (2/3/4 blocks) appear shifted left (row 0 has 2-block at cols 12-16, but likely should be at 17-21 like train 3 expected; row 3 has 2/4/3 mixed starting col 12, overlapping what seems like a left buffer of 9s), and left-side 8/1/7 shapes are placed early (rows 7-12 cols 0-4 correct, but row 6 has 8/2/3 at cols 16-21 which may be right spillover).
 * Background 9 is filled correctly in empties, and some components like 6 in rows 14-17 cols 6-8 look well-extracted/placed, but overall layout has mid-grid clutter (e.g., row 16 has 2/3 at cols 12-16, not pushed right), suggesting get_right_start triggered 12 due to minc <9 on some right component, causing panel overlap—does not match expected clean left (cols 0-11?), buffer, right (17-21) structure inferred from train 3.
 * Test has more colors (9 bg, 8/1 left?, 2/4/6/7/3 right?), and shapes seem vertically grouped (e.g., 2/4/3 stack in rows 1-5 cols 12+), but horizontal packing shifts them leftward incorrectly; no obvious clipping losses, but the entire right panel feels compressed into cols 12-21 instead of 17-21, leaving uneven 9s on far right.
 * To handle test, need to fix right start to always 17 unless specific spillover, and use uniform threshold (e.g., 0 or 1) to avoid over-merging; output makes partial sense (components preserved) but violates panel separation, so incorrect.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 23:22:30] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a 22x22 grid containing "framed" shapes (connected components outlined by specific frame colors like 8 or 2, with inner non-background, non-frame cells), and the goal is to extract these shapes, separate them into left-side (framed by 8) and right-side (framed by 2) groups, organize them into horizontal "blocks" based on row overlap, and rearrange them into a new output grid with left blocks placed starting from column 0 (left-aligned) and right blocks placed either at a fixed offset (e.g., column 12) or right-aligned, while filling the rest with background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of frame color (8 for left, 2 for right), excluding background (most common color in grid).
 * Inner cells of a shape are 8-connected (including diagonals) seeds adjacent to the frame, then flooded 4-connected if they are non-background and non-frame; this captures enclosed or adjacent non-frame blobs as part of the shape.
 * Shapes include both frame and inner cells; exclude already-used cells when finding the other side to avoid overlap.
 * Group shapes into "blocks" by sorting by min row and merging if they overlap in rows (i.e., if a shape's minr <= current block's maxr).
 * Placement: For left blocks, place sequentially from column 0, shifting each shape rightward by a delta to avoid overlap (but cap delta to fit within grid). For right blocks, placement logic is conditional (e.g., if minc <=8, start at 12; else right-align based on total width), but this is buggy and causes overlaps or misalignments; shapes in a block are sorted by minc and placed sequentially with width-based spacing.
 * Background is the most frequent color; output initializes to it.
 * Subtleties: Inner flood-fill must exclude frame and bg, but seeds can be diagonal to frame; blocks must handle vertical stacking implicitly via row overlap; right-side placement needs better heuristics (e.g., fixed gaps or mirroring left structure); potential for empty blocks or single-shape blocks; grid size is fixed at 22x22; colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 are fillers/inners, but 8/2 are frames.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping blocks might merge unexpectedly; delta calculation in placement can push shapes out of bounds or overlap if not maxed properly; right blocks may need symmetric placement (e.g., mirror left's structure); excluded set prevents double-counting shapes; 8-connect for seeds vs 4-connect for flood ensures tight inners but can miss diagonal enclosures.
 * All attempts consider connected components, but ignore rotation/flipping; no holes explicitly counted (though inners imply enclosure); test inputs may have asymmetric frames or nested shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List, Set, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably finds bg as most common color; useful across all grids.)

```python
def find_connected_frames(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, bg: int, excluded: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = None, n: int = 22) -> Tuple[List[Dict], Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (Full function as in program: Uses BFS for 4-connected frames, 8-connected seeds for inners, then 4-connected flood for inners.
    # Returns list of shape dicts with bounding box and all_cells, plus used cells set.
    # Helpful for extracting full shapes without overlap; core to separating left/right.
    # Subtlety: inner_seeds use directions8 excluding self; inner flood excludes frame/bg/excluded.)
    pass  # (Implementation as provided; it's functional but may over-include diagonal inners in some cases.)
```

```python
def group_into_blocks(comps: List[Dict]) -> List[List[Dict]]:
    # (Full function as in program: Sorts by minr, merges into blocks if row-overlapping.
    # Helpful for horizontal grouping; assumes vertical stacking via overlap, which works for non-overlapping rows but may chain-merge unexpectedly if shapes touch diagonally in rows.)
    pass
```

```python
def place_block(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], block: List[Dict], b_start: int, n: int):
    # (Full function as in program: Sorts block by minc, computes delta to align to curr_col (starting at b_start), caps to fit grid, copies cells with shift, advances curr_col by width.
    # Helpful base, but delta logic is flawed: proposed_delta = curr_col - min_c, but if too wide, sets to (n-1)-max_c (right-aligns single shape, not block); causes overlaps if block total width > available space; doesn't handle gaps between shapes in block well.)
    pass
```
(Note: get_background and find_connected_frames are solid and reusable; group_into_blocks is mostly good but could sort by minr+minc for ties; place_block needs fix for right-side conditional starts and better packing.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The right-block start logic in program() (if min_minc <=8: b_start=12 else: b_start=n-total_w) is broken: It right-aligns entire block but ignores left structure, leading to variable gaps; unhelpful for symmetric puzzles, causes test misalignment.
 * No explicit hole-detection function (e.g., counting enclosed bg in shapes); not present but would be helpful if puzzle involves solid vs hollow—current inner flood treats all non-bg non-frame as inner, which works but may include external adjacents wrongly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects frames and inners via BFS/flood (core extraction works, as seen in partial matches).
 * Training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated places right blocks too far left (e.g., row 7: 2's start at col 17 vs expected col 12; row 8: 3's at col 17 vs col 12; row 9: 2's/3's shifted right unexpectedly vs expected left-aligned block). What worked: Left side (8-frames with 5/3 inners) placed correctly at cols 1-9; bg=0 correct; shape extraction accurate (e.g., 1's in row 3 col 18-20 match). What didn't: Right block placement ignores fixed offset, uses flawed delta causing overlap/shift (e.g., total_w miscalc or no gap after left); row 11 has extra 2's not in expected.
 * Training 2 (CORRECT): Full match (not shown, but implies extraction/grouping/placement worked perfectly for that grid's structure—likely symmetric or simple blocks).
 * Training 3 (INCORRECT): Generated has left 2-frames misplaced (e.g., row 0: 2's at cols 5-9 vs expected cols 17-21; entire left side treats 2 as left-frame wrongly? Wait, no—program uses 8 for left, 2 for right, but row 0 generated starts with 1's then 2's early). What worked: Some inners like 3/5/6/4 extracted correctly (e.g., row 1-4: 3's in expected positions but shifted); bg=1 correct. What didn't: Right blocks (2-frames) placed on left side (e.g., row 0 2's at 5-9 vs right; row 13: 4's at 18-20 match but context wrong); conditional b_start fails (min_minc check places early); possible excluded set misses some 8-frames, treating them as right or skipping.
 * Overall: Shape detection solid (passes 1/3 trainings partially), but placement buggy—deltas don't preserve relative positions within blocks; right start heuristic (12 if minc<=8 else right-align) inconsistent, causes left/right bleed; no handling for blocks spanning full width or nested frames; unknown why train 2 succeeded (perhaps simple non-conditional case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears jumbled with left/right shapes bleeding across sides and poor alignment (e.g., row 0: 9's (bg?) dominate left, 2's at cols 12-16 (partial right block), but expected likely mirrors training with clear left 8-frames (e.g., 1/7 inners) at cols 0-10 and right 2-frames (e.g., 4/6/3) at cols 11+. Row 2: 2's/4's at 12-16 ok but followed by 2's at 17-21 overlapping; row 6: 8's at 16-21 (right 2-frame? misplaced as left?); row 7: 8's at 0-4 and 16-20 (symmetric but inners like 1/7 shifted wrong—expected 1's inside left 8's at cols 1-3). Why incorrect: Placement deltas cause overlaps (e.g., row 16: 2's/6's/3's crammed cols 12-21 without gaps); right blocks start variably (some at 12, others bleed left); extraction may include external cells as inners (e.g., row 8 8's at 16-20 seem like misplaced frame). To fix: Use fixed 11-col split (left 0-10, right 11-21), pack blocks tightly per side without conditional minc, ensure excluded prevents cross-side shapes.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 23:22:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 22x22 grid containing numerical values (likely representing colors or tiles) must be analyzed to identify specific "structures"—horizontal segments of uniform bordering color that extend vertically—then extracted and repositioned into a new 22x22 output grid in designated columns based on the border color (4 or 5), while omitting or conditionally including certain full-border rows to form a sorted, reorganized visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-background segments are potential structure starts.
 * Structures are defined as horizontal segments (length >=3) where the leftmost and rightmost cells match (border color != background), and they must be "new" (not covered by a segment from the previous row).
 * Vertical continuity: A structure extends downward only if subsequent rows have an exact matching segment (same start/end positions, same border color on edges); track all such rows.
 * Sorting: Structures are sorted by starting row, then column start position.
 * Separation and placement: Only structures with border 4 or 5 are relevant (others should be ignored); border-5 structures alternate between output columns 0 and 5 (even/odd index), border-4 between 17 and 12.
 * Row inclusion rules: Place all non-full-border rows; for full-border rows at the bottom, include the bottommost full group only if (border=5 and top is not full) or (border=4 and top is full); skip other bottom full rows.
 * Output grid initializes to background; placements overwrite in the assigned output column range, preserving original segment values.
 * Subtlety: Full rows are checked per row (all cells == border); top-full status is only for the structure's first row.
 * Easy to miss: Structures may not span the full grid width; vertical tracking requires exact positional and border matching; only "new" structures start a new entry (avoids duplicates).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no structures or non-4/5 borders without crashing; ensure all relevant structures get output columns assigned before placement; output must be exactly 22x22 with background fill.

from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value.)

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:
    segments = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            seg = []
            while i < n and row[i] != bg:
                seg.append(row[i])
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1, seg))
        else:
            i += 1
    return segments
```
(This extracts non-background segments from a row, returning start/end indices and the segment list; useful for identifying potential structure starts.)

(The main program function attempts structure detection, vertical tracking, sorting, column assignment, and placement but is broken—see below; the structure dict type is helpful: {'border': int, 'col_start': int, 'width': int, 'rows': List[Tuple[int, List[int]]], 'has_top_full': bool, 'out_col': int}.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented background detection, segment finding, and basic structure identification (new segments with matching borders, vertical continuity checking).
 * It properly sorted structures and separated border-4/5 groups.
 * Column assignment logic for border-4/5 (alternating 0/5 and 17/12) is correct in concept.
 * Row placement rules (conditional bottom full inclusion based on top-full status) are accurately captured.
 * What worked: get_background and find_segments functions succeed without errors; structure building and has_top_full check are logically sound.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all runs due to KeyError on 'out_col'—not all structures in the list have 'out_col' assigned (only border-4/5 get it, but placement loops over all structures, including potential non-4/5 ones); this crashes before any output is generated.
 * No actual outputs were produced for training examples 1-3 or test input, so cannot verify if placements match expected structures (e.g., omissions of full bottoms or vertical alignments).
 * The program assumes only border-4/5 exist but doesn't filter structures list before placement, leading to the crash.
 * No mismatches in generated outputs vs. expected (none generated), but the error indicates incomplete handling of irrelevant structures.
 * Function `program` is broken due to the KeyError but captures core logic (fix by filtering to only border-4/5 before placement or skipping others); still helpful as a base.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an execution error ('out_col'), so no grid was generated—does not look correct, as a valid 22x22 output grid is expected with re-placed structures in columns 0/5 (for border-5) and 12/17 (for border-4), background-filled elsewhere.
 * Without a generated grid, cannot confirm if it matches the test input's structures (e.g., correct vertical spans, omitted full bottoms per rules); the error prevents any verification, indicating the program fails to handle the test case's potential non-4/5 segments or assignment gaps.
 * To handle test case, ensure all placed structures have 'out_col' (e.g., filter to only border-4/5) and validate against expected omissions/inclusions for border types.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored or shaped cells against a background (most common number, often 0), where the goal is to identify connected non-background components (blobs), classify them based on whether they contain the special value 8 (treated as a hole or marker), and repack them: components with 8 go to the left side in horizontally compressed blocks, while those without go to the right side, all while preserving the original cell values and vertical positions but eliminating horizontal gaps within vertical row-overlapping groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background cells; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to find min/max row/col bounds and check for presence of 8 within the component.
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; components are only non-bg cells.
 * Classify components: "left_comps" if they contain at least one 8 (has_e=True), "right_comps" otherwise; 8 itself may be part of the component or a hole, but the code includes it in connectivity if !=bg.
 * Group components into vertical "blocks" by merging those whose row ranges overlap (sort by min_row, then chain if next min_r <= current max_r); this handles multi-object vertical stacks.
 * For each block, sort components by min_col, compute total width (sum of individual widths), then pack sequentially: left blocks start at col 0, right blocks start at n - total_width (right-aligned); copy cells row-by-row from original positions, but only non-bg values, and clip if exceeding bounds.
 * Subtlety: Packing preserves relative shapes but compresses horizontally (no gaps between components in a block); vertical positions stay absolute, but entire grid is reset to bg first.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/cols irregularly, so min/max bounds are used for width calc, but actual copying iterates over the component's rows and offsets within its width; overlapping components in a block must not overwrite incorrectly (code sorts by col to place left-to-right).
 * 8 is not background but a marker; if 8 is isolated, it might form its own component, but in examples, it's embedded.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 22x22); outputs must match exactly, including bg fills.
 * Potential issues: Misclassification if 8 is bg (but code checks !=bg); wrong block merging if row overlap logic fails on edge cases; right-packing may shift if total_w > available space (code uses max(0, start_col), but doesn't handle overflow well); copying may skip some cells if src/dst misalign.
 * All considerations: Preserve exact values (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) during copy; no rotation or vertical compression; blocks are per side independently; if no comps, output all bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component finding via flood-fill worked well, correctly identifying bounds and has_8 for most cases, as seen in train2 passing fully.
 * Block grouping by row overlap succeeded in train2, properly merging vertical stacks without gaps.
 * Left-packing (starting at col 0) was accurate in train2 and parts of train1 (e.g., top 5's and 3's aligned left).
 * Right-packing logic (n - total_w) worked in train2 but failed in train1 and train3, causing shifts (e.g., in train1 row13, expected full 2's row but generated scattered 2's; in train3 row0, expected right 2's but generated all 1's extended left).
 * Classification by has_8 was mostly correct but may misplace in train1 bottom (generated placed 6's left at col2-6 in row14, expected right at col12-16; unknown if 6's component wrongly detected as has_8 or block merge error).
 * Copying preserved values correctly where placed (e.g., 4's shapes intact), but failed to fill bg in gaps or overflows (train1 row17 generated 2's in right but expected 4's shifted).
 * In train3, right comps (e.g., bottom 4's and 3's) were under-packed, total_w too small or start_col wrong, leading to left-shift (e.g., row0 generated ends in 1's, expected ends in 2's; row16 generated 2's at end but expected 2's further right).
 * Overall, train1 incorrect due to bottom blocks mispacked (6's/4's/2's misplaced, e.g., row15 generated 8's left but expected 2's/6's right; row18 generated 0's in middle but expected 0's with 4's right).
 * Train2 correct: All left (with 8) and right (without) blocks packed without shifts, matching expected alignments.
 * Train3 incorrect: Similar to train1, right blocks (e.g., top 2's/3's) shifted left (row0: generated [1's full], expected [1's then 2's right]; row13: generated 2's leftish, expected 2's across middle-right).
 * The get_blocks function is helpful and correct for merging, but packing in right_blocks has bug in curr_col accumulation or width calc (possibly double-counting overlaps? but code doesn't; unknown).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all (find comps, group blocks, pack) are relevant but packing needs fix for right side clipping/offset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: left side has 8's and 1's/7's packed starting col0 (e.g., rows7-12: 8's and 1's/7's left), which aligns with has_8 comps; right side attempts right-pack (e.g., rows0-5: 2's/4's/3's ending rightish, row16-20: 2's/3's right), but inconsistencies like row6 having 8's/2's/3's scattered (expected tighter pack? unknown without expected, but looks gapped vs. compressed blocks).
 * It differs from likely expected by potential misclassification (e.g., row12: 9's left but 8's/3's middle; if 3's lack 8, should be right-packed without left 9's bleed); row14-15: 2's/6's left-middle, but if no 8, should right-align fully.
 * Gaps in middle (many 9's as bg?) are filled correctly, but packing seems loose (e.g., row2: 2's at col12-16 then 2's at 17-21, possible double-block but overlaps not merged?); overall, it demonstrates core logic but likely fails on block widths or right start_col like in train1/3, so not correct—needs tighter compression without internal gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid by identifying background (most common value), extracting connected "shapes" (non-background components) separately for left and right sides—left starting from cells marked 8 and flooding to all non-background, right starting from cells marked 2 and flooding to non-background excluding 8—and then regrouping these shapes into vertical "blocks" based on row overlap, compressing them horizontally by their bounding boxes, and placing left blocks aligned to the left edge and right blocks aligned to the right edge of a new output grid, while preserving vertical positions and overwriting background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common value in the flattened grid; everything else is part of shapes, but shapes must be extracted via flood fill from specific seeds (8 for left, 2 for right) to separate left/right components—do not assume all non-bg are shapes without seeding.
 * Flood fill uses 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right); shapes are sets of cells with their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for later placement.
 * Left extraction: Start from unvisited 8 cells, flood to any adjacent non-bg (this can accidentally include right shapes if they connect via non-bg paths to 8's, which seems to happen in some cases).
 * Right extraction: Start from unvisited 2 cells after left extraction (using shared visited set), flood only to non-bg and non-8; this excludes left shapes but may miss isolated right shapes if they don't start from 2 or if visited by left flood.
 * Grouping: Sort shapes by min row, then cluster into "blocks" where shapes overlap in row range (min_r of next <= max_r of current); within each block, sort by min col and place sequentially without gaps, shifting entire shapes horizontally to pack tightly.
 * Placement: Output starts as all bg; for left blocks, start at col 0 and add shape widths sequentially; for right blocks, start at col (n - total_block_width) and add leftward; rows stay absolute (no vertical shift); only place if new_col in bounds, but this can clip shapes.
 * Subtleties: Shared visited set prevents re-flooding, but left flood's broad condition (!= bg) can overgrab if components touch; right flood's exclusion of 8 prevents left overlap but may fragment shapes containing 2's near 8's. Bg may vary (0,1,9 across examples). Grids are square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). No diagonal connectivity. Shapes with only bg or empty after flood are skipped. Horizontal compression assumes no overlaps in block, but vertical stacking of blocks is implicit via per-block processing. Easy to miss: right shapes may include numbers like 1,3,4,5,6,9 if connected to 2; left includes 3,4,5,6 but not 2's directly. If a 2 is connected to 8 via non-bg, it gets grabbed as left, causing misalignment (seen in examples).
 * All non-seed cells (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,9) are treated as shape pixels with their original values; do not change values during extraction/placement.
 * Potential edge cases: Shapes spanning full width (no compression needed); isolated shapes; blocks with single shape; right shapes with varying widths; bg=0/1/9; grids where left/right touch via bg only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg, uses flood fill for shape extraction, groups into row-overlapping blocks, and performs horizontal compression/placement separately for left/right, which works fully for training example 2 (exact match, preserving all shapes like 3's,5's,6's in correct positions).
 * What worked: Shared visited prevents double-extraction; seeding from 8/2 separates sides; bounding box calculation enables compression; vertical positions preserved; one training example passes completely, showing core extraction/placement logic is sound when shapes are cleanly separated.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1 (INCORRECT), left flood overgrabs right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-4 shapes placed on left instead of right, like row 13 generated has 2's starting at col 2 on left vs. expected all 0's until col 12 with 2's on right; row 16 generated has 2-2-2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-6-6-6-2 on right with 4's shifted; row 17 generated has 2-4-4-4-2 on left vs. expected 2-2-2-2-2-2-4-4-4-2; unknown if due to connection via non-bg path to 8, but it misplaces entire blocks).
 * In training example 1, upper parts match (e.g., 5's,3's,1's on right correct), but lower right 9's and 6's/4's are fragmented or shifted leftward, and row 13 has extra 2's on left not in expected (expected has uniform 2's on right).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), left shapes (8-2-3-6) are placed correctly in middle-left, but right shapes are underplaced or overwritten: e.g., row 0 generated all 1's (bg) vs. expected 2's on right (missing top 2-3-4 block); row 1 generated has 2-3-3-3-2 on left-middle vs. expected on right; row 16 generated 2-2-2-2-2 on right but 3's misplaced left; overall, right blocks start too far left (e.g., total_width miscalculated, placing at col ~10 instead of n-5).
 * extract_objects via flood_fill is essential and mostly correct, but left flood condition (!= bg) is too broad (should perhaps exclude 2's or use stricter connectivity to prevent bleed); right flood (!= bg and !=8) is better but fails if 2's are visited by left.
 * The group_and_place function is helpful for blocking/packing but buggy in right-side base_col calculation (uses n - total_width, but if blocks have varying widths or overlaps, it packs left-to-right within right block, causing leftward shift into center).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (Counter for bg, flood, group, place) are relevant, though flood needs tuning for separation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules and patterns from training examples; it follows the same logic (bg=9, left from 8 including 1/7, right from 2 including 3/4/6), but shows similar issues as incorrect trainings: e.g., upper right 2-4-3 shapes are placed correctly compressed on right (rows 1-5 match expected pattern of packing 4's then 3's), but lower left 8-1-7 placed on left ok, yet row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 on left-middle then 2-3-3-3-2 on right (suggests overgrab of a 2-6 shape into left block, like ex1); row 17 has 2-2-2-2-2 on left then 8-3-3-3-8-2-3-3-3-2, with 3's split across center (expected likely packs right block tighter to right edge without left bleed); row 8 has isolated 8-1-1-1-8 on left but 7's below shifted, and right all 9's (missing any right shapes there?); overall, compression works for isolated blocks but shared visited + broad left flood causes right shapes (e.g., bottom 2-6-3) to fragment or misalign leftward, not fully right-justified as in correct ex2—does not match clean separation expected, likely needs stricter flood conditions to handle test's denser connections (e.g., 2's near 8's in rows 15-20).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid rearrangement where connected non-background "objects" (blobs) are identified, grouped into horizontal blocks based on row overlap, and then repacked into a new grid: special objects (those containing the number 8) are placed on the left side, while non-special objects are placed on the right side, all within their respective blocks, preserving relative shapes and positions vertically but shifting horizontally for packing without overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value in the grid (e.g., 0 in ex1, 1 in ex3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only, no diagonals), found via DFS/stack traversal, tracking bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and presence of 8 (a marker for "special" or "framed" objects).
 * Components are sorted by starting position (min row, then min col) before grouping into blocks.
 * Blocks are formed by merging components whose row ranges overlap (if a component's min row <= current block's max row, add it and update max row); this creates horizontal "layers" of interacting objects.
 * Within each block, special (has8=True) components are packed left-aligned starting at col 0, sorted by min col, shifted right sequentially without gaps.
 * Non-special components are packed on the right, but positioning logic must account for block-specific context: if the original block's min col <9 (suggesting left-side origin), start at col 12; else right-align from n - total_width. This heuristic is flawed and leads to overlaps or misplacements.
 * Vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly; only horizontal shifts occur during packing.
 * Empty rows/cols in output are filled with background.
 * Subtle: 8 often forms "frames" around other numbers (e.g., outlining 5's in ex1, 2's in ex3), so components with 8 include the frame and interior; non-8 components are plain shapes.
 * Objects must not overlap in output, but shapes must remain intact (no rotation, scaling, or splitting).
 * Grid size n x n is fixed (22x22 in examples), and output must match exactly, including all details like isolated numbers or extensions (e.g., 1's protruding in ex1 expected).
 * Easy to miss: Some objects span multiple blocks if row overlaps chain; packing must handle variable widths and ensure right-side starts don't clip or gap incorrectly.
 * In ex1 expected, some non-special like 1's and 3's are packed right but with specific alignments (e.g., 1's under 2's frame); in ex3, top extensions of 1's into row 0 are missing in generated.
 * Test input has complex overlaps (e.g., 8-frames around 1's,4's,7's,3's; plain 2's,6's), so block grouping is critical to avoid scattering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and block grouping worked well, correctly identifying blobs, 8-presence, and row-overlap blocks (evident in ex2 passing fully).
 * Left-side packing for has8 components is accurate: in ex1 generated, the 5/8 frame packs correctly left; in ex3, 2/8 and 3/8 frames pack left properly.
 * Ex2 correct: All elements (frames and plains) packed into correct blocks and sides without misplacement, showing core detection/packing works for simple cases.
 * Ex1 incorrect: Right-side non-8 objects (3's,1's,2's) misplaced—generated packs 3's too far right (cols 11-14) and 1's absent/misaligned, while expected has 3's under extended 8-frame (cols 6-8) and 1's (cols 18-20) under 2-frame; also lower 2/6/4 blocks wrong (e.g., 6's not framed correctly, 4's shifted left).
 * Ex3 incorrect: Top row generated has mixed 1's/2's (cols 0-10 wrong), missing expected plain 1's extension; right-side 5's and 2's/6's mispacked (e.g., 5's start at col 13 but expected at col 12; lower 4/3/8 block has 4's too left, 3's not aligned under expected positions); unknown why top 1's blob isn't preserved as plain right-side.
 * Right-side packing logic broken: Heuristic "12 if minc<9 else n-total_w" fails for variable block origins—causes overlaps/gaps (e.g., ex1 3's overlap potential left space; ex3 5's gap from left block); doesn't sort/pack sequentially like left side.
 * No rotation or shape alteration, but attempts preserve cells correctly.
 * find_components is essential and accurate for extraction (use in future).
 * pack_side is helpful for left but needs fix for right (e.g., always calculate available space after left pack, or use fixed split like col 11).
 * group_into_blocks is solid but assumes sorted input; subtle miss: if blocks have no has8, all go right—ensure no empty left.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though right-pack heuristic is flawed (avoid as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It scatters elements oddly (e.g., top 9's background with 2/4's packed leftish but 8/4's intrude row3 col17-20 overlapping potential right; mid 1/8 frame at left but 7's inside shifted wrong; lower 6/2's and 3/8 mix left/right incorrectly, with 3's at col17-19 under 8 but expected likely right-aligned after left frames like 1/8 and 4/8).
 * Missing clean separation: Expected should have clear left frames (8-around-1,4,7,3) packed sequentially from col0 per block, rights (plain 2,6,4,3?) starting after (e.g., col11 or calculated), but generated has overlaps (e.g., row17 8/3 at col11-16 clashing with potential 2/3 right) and unframed 4's/3's misplaced.
 * Background 9's fill correctly, but shapes distorted by bad shifts (e.g., row4 4/8 at col17-20 should be part of right or separate block; unknown why 7's frame doesn't include full outline).
 * Does not match training patterns: Ex1/3 expect tight packing without col12 heuristic failures; test likely needs dynamic right-start (e.g., max left width + gap) to avoid this mess.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract "framed" shapes (outlined in specific colors like 8 for left-side objects and 2 for right-side objects) from a 22x22 grid, including their internal filled regions (non-background, non-frame colors), group these shapes into vertically contiguous "blocks" based on row overlap, and reassemble them into a new grid by placing left blocks flush left and right blocks flush right, while filling the rest with the background color. The process separates left and right objects to avoid overlap, preserving the relative horizontal ordering within blocks but compressing them to the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are identified as connected components (using 4-connectivity for the frame outline itself) of a specific color (8 for left, 2 for right), and their "inner" regions are flooded from 8-neighbor seeds adjacent to the frame (but using 4-connectivity for the flood fill), excluding background and frame cells; this captures enclosed or adjacent non-background content as part of the shape.
 * Shapes are treated as single units including both frame and inner cells; empty or background-only "shapes" are implicitly skipped since all_cells would be empty.
 * Grouping into blocks uses vertical sorting and merges components if their row ranges overlap (minr <= current maxr), creating horizontal strips of shapes; within each block, components are sorted left-to-right by minc and placed without gaps, but shifted to the left edge (for left blocks) or right edge (for right blocks) of the output grid.
 * Exclusion of already-used cells (from left when processing right) prevents double-claiming overlapping or shared elements; background is the most common color, and output starts filled with it.
 * Subtle connectivity: 4-dir for frame and inner flood ensures orthogonally connected blobs, but 8-dir seeds for inners allow detecting diagonally adjacent starts; this can miss thin diagonals or cause over-inclusion if not careful.
 * Placement shifts entire blocks by delta_c based on cumulative widths, but only copies if new_c is in bounds (0-21), potentially clipping edges; vertical positions (rows) are preserved from original.
 * Objects may span multiple rows/columns irregularly; right-side objects might have different frame colors or interleaving with left; inners can be multi-color but are copied as-is.
 * Potential misses: If a frame encloses multiple disconnected inners, the flood from multiple seeds might merge them incorrectly if they connect via 4-dir; background can appear inside frames but is excluded; no rotation or resizing—exact copy with horizontal compression per block.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; colors are integers 0-9, with 0 often background but varies (e.g., 1 in train 3).
 * All considerations: Avoid overwriting during placement (but code places sequentially, so left then right might overlap if blocks wide); handle cases where blocks don't fill full width; preserve exact cell values when copying; no vertical shifting or reordering blocks—order by original minr.

                new_c = c + delta_c
                if 0 <= new_c < n:
                    out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
            cum += widths[idx]
```
(Helpful for placing blocks: sorts comps left-to-right, computes cumulative shift to edge, copies cells with column delta while preserving rows; bounds check prevents out-of-grid writes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 2 entirely, demonstrating core extraction, grouping, and placement logic works for some cases with standard left/right separation and vertical blocks.
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output misplaced right-side elements, e.g., row 13 (0-based) has scattered 2's and misplaced 6's/4's instead of a full horizontal 2-bar connecting the bottom shapes; row 14 has 2's starting too left with 6's; row 15 has 8's and 4's shifted wrong, and bottom 4's/2's compressed incorrectly (e.g., row 17 has extra 2's where expected has 2's+4's aligned differently); this suggests over-shifting or incorrect width calculation in place_blocks for right blocks, or missing a connecting frame/bar in grouping; left side mostly matched but had minor inner placements off (e.g., row 2 has extra 0's where expected has none).
 * For training 3 (INCORRECT): Top row (row 0) generated full left 1's+2's where expected has partial 1's+right 2's starting mid-grid; row 1 has 8's+2's+3's shifted left with extra 1's, but expected has 8's then 1's then right 2's+3's; this indicates failure to preserve original column gaps or incorrect left/right separation, possibly claiming right frames as left or vice versa; lower parts (e.g., row 13) matched better, but overall compression ignored central spacing; unknown why top 1's background was treated as frame.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_connected_frames acts as one and is essential; get_background is reliable.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though inner flood might over-merge if seeds connect unintended regions (potential bug in train 1/3 mismatches).
 * General issue: Program assumes fixed frame colors (8 left, 2 right), which worked for train 2 but may fail if colors vary (e.g., train 3 has 1 as bg, 2/8 frames); exclusion set prevents overlap but might skip shared inners.
 * Grouping correctly merges vertical overlaps but may create too-wide blocks if shapes touch diagonally (not an issue here, but subtle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have severe misalignment and over-compression, e.g., top rows (0-5) cram left 9's (likely bg) with right 2's+4's+3's shifted leftward, creating a dense left-packed mess instead of separated sides; middle (rows 7-12) has 8's frames with 1's/7's inners on left but trailed by 9's bg invading right space; bottom (rows 14-21) mixes 2's+6's+3's in a jumbled way with 8's appearing mid-right, suggesting failed left/right exclusion (e.g., row 16 has 8's in right block area) and incorrect delta_c shifts causing overlaps/clips; expected should preserve vertical blocks separately (e.g., top-right 2/4/3 block flush right, mid-left 8/1/7 block flush left, bottom mixed but separated), with clean bg fills—no such separation here, and colors like 9's bg not handled as output fill properly; this fails core separation, likely due to dynamic frame colors (test has 8/2 but bg=9) or seed/flood bugs pulling wrong inners.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a 22x22 grid containing "framed" shapes (connected components outlined by specific frame colors like 8 or 2, with inner non-background, non-frame cells), and the goal is to extract these shapes, separate them into left-side (framed by 8) and right-side (framed by 2) groups, organize them into horizontal "blocks" based on row overlap, and rearrange them into a new output grid with left blocks placed starting from column 0 (left-aligned) and right blocks placed either at a fixed offset (e.g., column 12) or right-aligned, while filling the rest with background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of frame color (8 for left, 2 for right), excluding background (most common color in grid).
 * Inner cells of a shape are 8-connected (including diagonals) seeds adjacent to the frame, then flooded 4-connected if they are non-background and non-frame; this captures enclosed or adjacent non-frame blobs as part of the shape.
 * Shapes include both frame and inner cells; exclude already-used cells when finding the other side to avoid overlap.
 * Group shapes into "blocks" by sorting by min row and merging if they overlap in rows (i.e., if a shape's minr <= current block's maxr).
 * Placement: For left blocks, place sequentially from column 0, shifting each shape rightward by a delta to avoid overlap (but cap delta to fit within grid). For right blocks, placement logic is conditional (e.g., if minc <=8, start at 12; else right-align based on total width), but this is buggy and causes overlaps or misalignments; shapes in a block are sorted by minc and placed sequentially with width-based spacing.
 * Background is the most frequent color; output initializes to it.
 * Subtleties: Inner flood-fill must exclude frame and bg, but seeds can be diagonal to frame; blocks must handle vertical stacking implicitly via row overlap; right-side placement needs better heuristics (e.g., fixed gaps or mirroring left structure); potential for empty blocks or single-shape blocks; grid size is fixed at 22x22; colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 are fillers/inners, but 8/2 are frames.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping blocks might merge unexpectedly; delta calculation in placement can push shapes out of bounds or overlap if not maxed properly; right blocks may need symmetric placement (e.g., mirror left's structure); excluded set prevents double-counting shapes; 8-connect for seeds vs 4-connect for flood ensures tight inners but can miss diagonal enclosures.
 * All attempts consider connected components, but ignore rotation/flipping; no holes explicitly counted (though inners imply enclosure); test inputs may have asymmetric frames or nested shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List, Set, Tuple, Dict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably finds bg as most common color; useful across all grids.)

```python
def find_connected_frames(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, bg: int, excluded: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = None, n: int = 22) -> Tuple[List[Dict], Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (Full function as in program: Uses BFS for 4-connected frames, 8-connected seeds for inners, then 4-connected flood for inners.
    # Returns list of shape dicts with bounding box and all_cells, plus used cells set.
    # Helpful for extracting full shapes without overlap; core to separating left/right.
    # Subtlety: inner_seeds use directions8 excluding self; inner flood excludes frame/bg/excluded.)
    pass  # (Implementation as provided; it's functional but may over-include diagonal inners in some cases.)
```

```python
def group_into_blocks(comps: List[Dict]) -> List[List[Dict]]:
    # (Full function as in program: Sorts by minr, merges into blocks if row-overlapping.
    # Helpful for horizontal grouping; assumes vertical stacking via overlap, which works for non-overlapping rows but may chain-merge unexpectedly if shapes touch diagonally in rows.)
    pass
```

```python
def place_block(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], block: List[Dict], b_start: int, n: int):
    # (Full function as in program: Sorts block by minc, computes delta to align to curr_col (starting at b_start), caps to fit grid, copies cells with shift, advances curr_col by width.
    # Helpful base, but delta logic is flawed: proposed_delta = curr_col - min_c, but if too wide, sets to (n-1)-max_c (right-aligns single shape, not block); causes overlaps if block total width > available space; doesn't handle gaps between shapes in block well.)
    pass
```
(Note: get_background and find_connected_frames are solid and reusable; group_into_blocks is mostly good but could sort by minr+minc for ties; place_block needs fix for right-side conditional starts and better packing.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The right-block start logic in program() (if min_minc <=8: b_start=12 else: b_start=n-total_w) is broken: It right-aligns entire block but ignores left structure, leading to variable gaps; unhelpful for symmetric puzzles, causes test misalignment.
 * No explicit hole-detection function (e.g., counting enclosed bg in shapes); not present but would be helpful if puzzle involves solid vs hollow—current inner flood treats all non-bg non-frame as inner, which works but may include external adjacents wrongly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects frames and inners via BFS/flood (core extraction works, as seen in partial matches).
 * Training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated places right blocks too far left (e.g., row 7: 2's start at col 17 vs expected col 12; row 8: 3's at col 17 vs col 12; row 9: 2's/3's shifted right unexpectedly vs expected left-aligned block). What worked: Left side (8-frames with 5/3 inners) placed correctly at cols 1-9; bg=0 correct; shape extraction accurate (e.g., 1's in row 3 col 18-20 match). What didn't: Right block placement ignores fixed offset, uses flawed delta causing overlap/shift (e.g., total_w miscalc or no gap after left); row 11 has extra 2's not in expected.
 * Training 2 (CORRECT): Full match (not shown, but implies extraction/grouping/placement worked perfectly for that grid's structure—likely symmetric or simple blocks).
 * Training 3 (INCORRECT): Generated has left 2-frames misplaced (e.g., row 0: 2's at cols 5-9 vs expected cols 17-21; entire left side treats 2 as left-frame wrongly? Wait, no—program uses 8 for left, 2 for right, but row 0 generated starts with 1's then 2's early). What worked: Some inners like 3/5/6/4 extracted correctly (e.g., row 1-4: 3's in expected positions but shifted); bg=1 correct. What didn't: Right blocks (2-frames) placed on left side (e.g., row 0 2's at 5-9 vs right; row 13: 4's at 18-20 match but context wrong); conditional b_start fails (min_minc check places early); possible excluded set misses some 8-frames, treating them as right or skipping.
 * Overall: Shape detection solid (passes 1/3 trainings partially), but placement buggy—deltas don't preserve relative positions within blocks; right start heuristic (12 if minc<=8 else right-align) inconsistent, causes left/right bleed; no handling for blocks spanning full width or nested frames; unknown why train 2 succeeded (perhaps simple non-conditional case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears jumbled with left/right shapes bleeding across sides and poor alignment (e.g., row 0: 9's (bg?) dominate left, 2's at cols 12-16 (partial right block), but expected likely mirrors training with clear left 8-frames (e.g., 1/7 inners) at cols 0-10 and right 2-frames (e.g., 4/6/3) at cols 11+. Row 2: 2's/4's at 12-16 ok but followed by 2's at 17-21 overlapping; row 6: 8's at 16-21 (right 2-frame? misplaced as left?); row 7: 8's at 0-4 and 16-20 (symmetric but inners like 1/7 shifted wrong—expected 1's inside left 8's at cols 1-3). Why incorrect: Placement deltas cause overlaps (e.g., row 16: 2's/6's/3's crammed cols 12-21 without gaps); right blocks start variably (some at 12, others bleed left); extraction may include external cells as inners (e.g., row 8 8's at 16-20 seem like misplaced frame). To fix: Use fixed 11-col split (left 0-10, right 11-21), pack blocks tightly per side without conditional minc, ensure excluded prevents cross-side shapes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid of digits (0-9) where the goal is to extract and reposition "framed shapes" (connected components outlined by a specific frame color like 8 or 2, enclosing non-background inner cells) onto a new output grid with the same background color. Shapes framed by 8 are placed sequentially on the left side (starting from column 0, stacking vertically without overlap), while shapes framed by 2 are placed on the right side (starting from column 21, stacking vertically and shifting leftward as needed to avoid overlaps), preserving the relative internal structure and colors of each shape while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent digit in the input grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3); all non-shape areas in output must be this color.
 * Shapes are defined by connected components (4-directional adjacency) of frame cells (e.g., 8 or 2); inner cells are adjacent non-background, non-frame, non-opposite-frame cells captured within or near the frame—important to avoid including unrelated cells.
 * Exclude frame cells and inners of already-processed shapes (e.g., mark 8-shape cells to skip when finding 2-shapes) to prevent double-processing overlapping or adjacent objects.
 * Left placement (for 8-frames): Stack shapes left-to-right in row order, placing each at the current left width if vertically continuous, or reset to column 0 if a gap (>1 row) exists; copy inner/frame colors exactly, but only non-background values.
 * Right placement (for 2-frames): Stack from the right edge (column 21), placing new vertical blocks at 22 - width; if overlap with existing right content, shift the entire existing right block left by the needed delta, clear the old space, and place the new shape at the old start position—handle block min/max rows for shifting.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have irregular bounding boxes; placement must respect vertical continuity (e.g., new shape in same "block" if minr <= last_maxr +1, else new block). Inner cell detection uses 8-directional neighbors but excludes frames/background—easy to miss partial enclosures or adjacent non-inners. No rotation/scaling; preserve exact relative positions within bounding box. Grid is fixed 22x22; out-of-bounds placement is clipped. Process 8-shapes first, then 2-shapes, as 8 takes priority for left. Potential for empty shapes or single-cell frames (though not seen). Test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9) or more complex overlaps/shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * 10
    for row in g:
        for v in row:
            if 0 <= v < 10:
                count[v] += 1
    return count.index(max(count))
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; essential and works across examples.)

                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:

                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            frame_cells.append((nx, ny))

                all_cells = frame_cells + list(inner_cells)
                if all_cells:
                    minr = min(x for x, _ in all_cells)
                    maxr = max(x for x, _ in all_cells)

                    shapes.append({'minr': minr, 'maxr': maxr, 'minc': minc, 'maxc': maxc})
    return shapes
```
(This BFS-based shape finder with visited set and inner cell detection via 8-dir neighbors is core and mostly works; returns bounding boxes for placement. The eight_cells exclusion prevents re-processing 8-shapes when finding 2-shapes. Helpful for extracting connected frames and their enclosures.)

        else:

        # place (assume no conflict)
        for rr in range(minr, maxr + 1):
            for kk in range(w):

(This handles left stacking with vertical block detection; works for non-overlapping left placements but assumes no conflicts—fine for 8-shapes as they go first.)

(This attempts right-side stacking with conflict detection and shifting; conceptually helpful for handling overlaps by expanding leftward, but buggy in execution—see previous attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—left 8-shapes placed sequentially in columns 0-4 (e.g., the top 8-frame with 2-inners and bottom 8-frame with 3-inners), right 2-shapes in columns 17-21 (e.g., 5/4 shapes shifted appropriately); full grid matches expected.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—similar left/right separation works, with background 1, 8-frames on left (including 6-inner), 2-frames on right (3/4/5 inners placed without overlap).
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—left 8-shapes placed mostly correctly (e.g., top 8 with 2-inners in cols 1-3, bottom 8 with 3-inners in cols 1-3, 6-inner in cols 6-8), but right 2-shapes misplaced: e.g., row 8 has 2's in cols 16-21 instead of expected cols 12-16 with 1's after; row 9 has 2/5's starting col 16 instead of col 12 with 1's after; row 12 has 2's only in cols 17-21 instead of cols 12-21; row 13 has 2/4's in cols 17-21 matching expected but contextually wrong due to prior misplacements. This suggests right placement logic fails to shift correctly for vertically continuous blocks, causing shapes to stack too far right without proper leftward adjustment or block merging.
 * Overall: Shape extraction via find_shapes works well (correctly identifies bounding boxes and excludes processed cells via eight_cells set). Left placement is reliable (no conflicts assumed, stacks correctly). Right placement has bugs in conflict resolution/shifting (e.g., delta calculation or block row updates may not propagate correctly, leading to overlaps or wrong start_cols; unknown why is_new flag or current_start_col min() doesn't align blocks properly). Inner cell detection seems accurate but may over/under-include in complex enclosures (not evident here). No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though place_right_shapes needs fixing for shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mentally applying rules: background appears to be 9 (most frequent, matches top rows). Left side has 8-frames placed in cols 0-4 (e.g., rows 3-7 with 4-inners, rows 16-20 with 3-inners—seems correct stacking). Middle has some 8/1/7 shapes around rows 8-12, possibly misplaced or extra. Right side 2-frames in cols 12-17 (e.g., rows 0-3 with 4-inners, rows 13-16 with 6-inners, rows 17-20 with 3-inners) show some shifting leftward, but positions like row 2 having 2's in cols 12-21 (extending too far) and row 8 having isolated 1's in cols 6-8 (possibly inner from unprocessed shape) suggest incomplete exclusion of 8-shapes or faulty right shifts—e.g., the 7-inner in row 9 cols 11-13 seems shifted wrong, and bottom row 21 all 9's is fine but upper rows have extraneous 2's in row 2 cols 17-21. It handles different background (9) and new colors (4/6/1/7/3) but likely fails similar to training 3 on right-side block merging/shifting, causing partial overlaps or misaligned blocks (e.g., the 3-shapes in rows 3/17-20 look okay but context suggests propagation error).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid where the goal is to identify and extract "frames" or connected components of specific colors (primarily 8 for left-side shapes and 2 for right-side shapes), including their inner contents, then rearrange and place these shapes onto a new output grid starting from the left for left shapes and from the right for right shapes, stacking them vertically when they share row ranges while handling overlaps, conflicts, and shifting to avoid collisions, all against a determined background color (usually 1 or 9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected components of frame colors (8 for left, 2 for right), but must include adjacent inner cells that are neither background nor frame color; bounding boxes encompass both frame and inner cells.
 * Left shapes are placed progressively from the left edge, with new vertical blocks (disconnected by row gaps) starting at column 0, but continuing blocks stack horizontally without gaps; right shapes start from the right edge (column 21), stacking leftward for continuing blocks and shifting entire prior blocks leftward if overlaps/conflicts occur with existing placements.
 * Background color is the most common cell value; output grid initializes to this background.
 * Sorting shapes by minimum row ensures top-to-bottom placement order.
 * Excluded cells from left shapes prevent double-counting when finding right shapes (pass left used cells as exclusion).
 * Subtlety: Inner cell detection uses a 3x3 neighborhood around each frame cell, excluding the frame cell itself, but only adds non-bg, non-frame cells— this can miss disconnected inners or over-include if not careful; in the code, it adds them to all_cells_list for bounding but doesn't verify connectivity of inners.
 * Conflicts in right placement trigger shifting the entire current vertical block left by the width of the new shape, overwriting and clearing the shifted area— this is crucial for stacking without overlap.
 * Vertical blocks are defined by consecutive shapes without row gaps (> last_max_r); new blocks reset placement positions.
 * Easy to miss: Frame colors are fixed (8 left, 2 right), but background varies (1 in training, 9 in test); also, some shapes may have frames of other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 in examples) but are treated as inners unless connected via frame color.
 * Placement only copies non-bg cells; out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Potential issue: The inner detection might include cells from other shapes if adjacent, leading to bloated bounding boxes.
 * All shapes must be found excluding previously used cells to separate left/right distinctly.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; no rotation or mirroring.

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:

(This is core for extracting connected frame components and their adjacent inners, returning bounding boxes and used cells; helpful for separation of left/right.)

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda sh: sh['minr'])
```
(Essential for ordering shapes top-to-bottom.)

The place_left and place_right functions in the program are mostly helpful but buggy (see below); they handle progressive placement and shifting but need refinement for conflict detection and inner inclusion.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background, extracts left shapes (color 8 frames) and right shapes (color 2 frames) using connected components and inners, sorts them by row, and places them on a new grid— this worked fully for training examples 1 and 2.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT), the generated output mismatches the expected in several rows: e.g., row 0 has 2's in columns 12-16 in generated but all 1's there in expected (with 2's only at 17-21); row 4 has 1's in columns 5-11 in generated but expected has 1's there correctly wait no— actually, deeper diffs include misplaced 2's and 3's in rows 2-4 and 16-17, suggesting over-placement or incorrect stacking of right shapes; also, row 5 has 8's across in generated but expected has mixed 8's and 1's/2's, indicating failure to clear or shift properly during right placement.
 * Left placement seems correct in training 3 (e.g., the 8-framed shapes with 2/3 inners on left side match), but right placement fails: it incorrectly places some right shapes (like the 3/4 block) too far right without shifting, causing overlaps or missing the expected leftward stacking.
 * The find_right_shapes function has a bug: it calls find_connected_frames but returns only the shapes list, ignoring the used_cells (line: return _ ); this might cause incomplete exclusion.
 * Inner cell detection adds all adjacent non-bg/non-frame cells but doesn't ensure they belong to the shape (could grab from nearby objects), leading to incorrect bounding boxes in dense areas.
 * place_right's conflict handling shifts by width but only if not new block, and the shifting code clears right side but may not propagate correctly to all rows in the block; in training 3, this likely caused the 2/3/4 shapes to not stack properly under the upper block.
 * place_left assumes proposed_left = 0 for gaps or current for continues, but doesn't handle width overflows well (clips at n=22).
 * Overall, core extraction and left placement work, but right placement's shifting/conflict logic is flawed, missing subtle row-block updates.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the buggy return in find_right_shapes should be fixed (return shapes, right_cells or just shapes if not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training examples: background is correctly 9, left shapes (8-frames with 4 inners) are placed properly on left in rows 3-7 and 16-20, and some right shapes (2-frames with 3/4/6/7 inners) are stacked on right, but issues include: row 0 has 2's in 12-16 which shouldn't be there (likely a stray placement, similar to training 3 error); row 2 has 2's in 17-21 but expected pattern would likely have them shifted left more; row 8-13 show fragmented placements (e.g., 8's and 1's mixed oddly in cols 11-16, suggesting incomplete exclusion or inner overgrab); row 14 has 6's under 2's incorrectly positioned; overall, right stacking seems off with insufficient leftward shifting for overlapping row blocks (e.g., the lower 2/3 block in rows 16-20 overlaps row-wise with upper but isn't compressed properly), leading to spillover into left areas or missing clears— this mirrors training 3's right-side errors and indicates the same shifting bug persists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (non-background regions) are identified, separated based on whether they contain the color 8, and rearranged into a standardized output grid: components with 8 are stacked horizontally on the left side (with row-gap resets), while others are placed in fixed or conditional positions on the right or middle. The goal is to preserve component shapes and colors while reorganizing them according to spatial rules, likely to "sort" or "align" puzzle elements like objects or shapes in a 22x22 grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components containing color 8 are treated as "left" (stacked progressively from left, starting at column 0, with width accumulation; reset horizontal position to 0 if the component's min row exceeds the previous max row +1, indicating vertical separation).
 * Components without 8 are "right" and placed independently: if their original min column >=9 (right-half origin), shift to align right edge at column 21; otherwise, shift to align left edge at column 12 (middle placement).
 * Output grid is initialized to background; placements may clip if new column is out of [0,21] bounds, but shapes must remain intact otherwise.
 * Sorting of left components by min row ensures top-to-bottom stacking order.
 * Subtle: Row-based gap detection in left stacking prevents overlap but assumes components don't interleave vertically; right placements ignore row and use original column heuristics, which may fail if components span unusual positions.
 * Colors and connectivity must be preserved exactly; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Grid size fixed at 22x22; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 instead of 1 or 2).
 * Easy to miss: Right components' offsets are asymmetric (12 for leftish, 21 for rightish), potentially misplacing narrow/wide or vertically elongated components; left stacking accumulates position without vertical shifting.
 * All components must be placed without overlap in output, but clipping is allowed (though undesirable).
 * Training failures highlight placement offsets: e.g., horizontal shifts don't account for full bounding box alignment in all cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]  # DFS flood fill
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(This correctly extracts connected components excluding background; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def get_bounding(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in comp]
    cs = [c for _, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Provides min/max row/col for placement offsets; key for width calculation and positioning.)

```python
def has_eight(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    colors = {g[r][c] for r, c in comp}
    return 8 in colors
```
(Accurately separates "left" (with 8) vs "right" components; core to the puzzle's bifurcation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2: Correct, indicating solid background detection, component extraction, 8-based separation, left stacking with row-gap reset, and basic right offsets work for simple cases (e.g., components with clear left/right origins and no complex overlaps).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated output misplaces several components, e.g., row 0 has 2's at columns 12-16 instead of expected 17-21 (shifted left by ~5); row 1 has 3's at 17-19 but expected at 18-20 with surrounding 2's adjusted; row 6 has 1's filling where expected 8's and 6's should be (full left block missing); row 7 similar with 1's overwriting expected 1's but misaligning 6's; overall, right/middle components (e.g., 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's) are offset incorrectly, suggesting the conditional offset (minc >=9 ? 21-maxc : 12-minc) fails for components originating in columns <9 but needing middle/right alignment, or clipping/overlap issues; left components with 8 are partially correct but some (e.g., top 2/3 shapes) shifted horizontally.
 * Left stacking logic works for vertical separation but accumulates position without resetting for width overlaps in dense rows (unknown if this caused specific mismatches).
 * Right placement heuristic (column-based origin) is too rigid; doesn't sort by row or handle components spanning column 9 boundary.
 * No vertical shifting in placements; assumes original rows are final, which works if input is row-sorted but fails if components are interleaved.
 * Function `program` overall structure is helpful but offset calculations need refinement for edge cases like narrow components or those near column 9.
 * Component sorting by min row is essential and worked; without it, order would be arbitrary.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows disorganized placements, e.g., row 0 has 2's at 12-16 but then 9's, suggesting incomplete middle/right alignment (expected likely has consistent right-stacking like training 3's expected, with 2/4 shapes pushed further right); row 3 has 8's on left but 4's and 3's misaligned in columns 17-21 (overlapping or clipped, unlike expected clean blocks); row 8 has 8's scattered with 1's in middle where a solid block might be expected; row 15 has 6's broken by 2's, indicating failed connectivity preservation or wrong offset (e.g., minc <9 triggered 12-minc but component width caused overrun); row 17 has 3's split across columns 14-17 and 18-20 with 8's intruding, showing overlap or incorrect conditional (minc >=9 not handling hybrid positions); overall, resembles training 3 errors—right components not properly segregated to columns 12+ or 21-, leading to clutter; background 9 is handled, but puzzle rules (e.g., no overlaps, shape integrity) are violated in multiple rows, so it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify connected components as "objects" (excluding background color, typically 4, and treating 8 as a special frame color), distinguishing framed objects (those bordered by a single connected 8-component) from unframed ones, combining framed objects with their frames, sorting all objects by their minimum row and column positions, and rearranging them into a new grid by shifting their columns to standardized starting positions while preserving row positions and internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is the dominant filler (e.g., 4 in examples); ignore it and 8 (frames) when initially finding objects, but include 8 in framed objects if it's the sole adjacent non-background, non-object color.
 * Objects are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) components of the same color; use flood-fill to extract them and mark visited to avoid reprocessing.
 * Framed detection: Check adjacent cells to an object; if exactly one non-background, non-object color (must be 8) borders it, treat as framed and merge the entire connected 8-component as part of the object (use a separate flood-fill without global visited to capture the full frame).
 * Sorting: Both framed and unframed objects sorted by (min_row, min_col) ascending; process framed first, then unframed.
 * Placement rules: For framed, column start depends on min_row (0 if >=10, else 5 if min_col >=12 else 0); shift object columns relative to its min_col. For unframed, column start is 12 if (min_col + 2 < 11) else 17; no row dependency. Preserve exact relative positions within the object (including frames), but overwrite background in new grid.
 * Subtleties: Frames may wrap or be incomplete but must be a single connected component; merging frames avoids double-counting cells. Unframed objects ignore any adjacent non-8 colors. Grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22). Ensure no overlap in placement (columns are spaced to avoid it). Visited marking must cover merged frames to skip them later. Adjacent frame detection uses a set for unique colors but collects adjacent cells only for the primary frame color.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching edges, multi-object adjacency without framing, frames not fully enclosing (but still valid if connected and sole adjacent), varying background (detect as g[0][0]).
 * Potential misses: Incorrect frame merging (e.g., partial frames or multiple frames), wrong column starts leading to overlaps/shifts, failing to include frame cells in min_r/min_c calculations, or treating 8 as an object instead of frame.

```
These flood-fills are essential for component extraction; the no-visit variant prevents interference when merging frames. Object dicts (with 'cells', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'is_framed') are useful for storage.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles basic object detection, framing for simple cases, sorting, and placement for training examples 1 and 3 (full match, preserving shapes and positions).
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output mismatches expected in rows 16-20, where the bottom framed structure (involving 1's inside a frame with adjacent 6's) is incorrectly placed or merged—generated has isolated 1's without full frame integration (e.g., row 16: [8,8,8,8,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]), and 6's are shifted wrong (row 17 generated: [8,6,6,6,8,...] but expected integrates frame around 1's and 6's differently); unknown why frame detection missed the complex bordering (possibly adj_f set logic buggy for multi-adjacent frames).
 * Frame adjacency logic has issues: The code collects adj_f only for the first frame color detected (via if col_adj == list(f_set)[0] if f_set else False), which may skip parts of irregular frames; f_set checks len==1 but doesn't handle if multiple frame components touch.
 * Visited marking after merging works for simple frames but may leave unvisited frame parts if flood_fill_no_visit misses connections.
 * Unframed placement correct in working examples, but train 2 suggests framing misclassification for bottom objects (1's treated unframed?).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the adj_f collection loop is overly complex and error-prone (simplify to collect all adjacent frame cells after confirming single f).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies and places upper objects (e.g., the 2-5-3 group in cols 12-17, framed 4's in cols 5-8 for rows 3-6), and lower unframed 6's/3's, but mismatches likely in the bottom-left framed area (rows 16-20: generated has separate 3's frame at cols 0-4 and unframed 6's/3's shifted to cols 12+, but mentally tracing rules, the input's bottom 1's/6's/3's seem to form a complex framed structure similar to train 2's issue—expected should merge the 8-frame around the interwoven 1's (absent in input? wait, test input not fully shown but inferred), 6's, and 3's into one object with adjusted min_r/min_c, placing as framed starting col 0 or 5; generated separates them, causing row 15-16 shifts (e.g., 6's at col 18-20 unmerged) and missing frame integration, leading to incomplete enclosure like train 2.
 * Upper framed 7's (rows 9-12, cols 1-3) correctly placed but min_c calc may be off if frame included wrong. Overall, output preserves most shapes but fails complex multi-object framing, suggesting same bug as train 2; does not fully match mentally simulated correct (which would have tighter bottom packing with merged frame).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing a scene or diagram with background, connected "objects" (components), and special elements marked by 8 (likely indicators like "E" for emphasis or extraction). The goal is to rearrange these components into a new grid: "left" components (those containing 8) are stacked or aligned on the left side (columns 0+), while "right" components (without 8) are placed in fixed right-side positions (e.g., starting at columns 12 or 17), all on a background, preserving shapes and connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the flattened grid; all non-background cells form 4-way connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components containing at least one 8 are treated as "left" and must be placed in a vertically stacked manner on the left, sorted by top-left position (min row, then min column), with vertical gaps preserved (e.g., if a component starts below the previous one's max row +1, it starts a new "column" at 0; otherwise, it appends horizontally).
 * "Right" components (no 8) are placed rigidly: those originally in leftish positions (min column <=8) go to column 12; those in rightish positions (min column >8) go to column 17, without sorting or stacking—simple horizontal shift.
 * Preserve exact shapes: when placing, shift cells by delta columns (and rows if needed, but code assumes row-aligned), overwriting background only if new position is in bounds (0 to n-1); no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Subtle: Components may span multiple rows/columns; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement offsets. 8-cells are not special beyond flagging the component—copy them as-is.
 * Gaps in vertical stacking for left components: If a left component's min row > previous max row +1, reset horizontal position to column 0; else, continue from current width. This handles multi-level "scenes" but can misalign if sorting or gap logic fails.
 * Right placement is heuristic-based (threshold at column 8), assuming grid width ~22; may fail if components overlap post-shift or if original positions vary.
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting in DFS/BFS for components; flat Counter for background works but assumes no ties (most_common(1)). No handling for isolated 8s or components touching edges.
 * Overall: Output grid starts as all-background; placements don't merge or resolve overlaps (but code avoids by position choice). n=22 in examples.

                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append({
                    'cells': cells,
                    'minr': min_r,
                    'maxr': max_r,
                    'minc': min_c,
                    'maxc': max_c,
                    'has8': has_e
                })
    return components
```
(This extracts components correctly with bounding boxes and 8-flag; essential for separation and placement; DFS stack handles irregular shapes well.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    bg = get_background(g)
    all_comps = find_components(g, bg)
    left_comps = [c for c in all_comps if c['has8']]
    right_comps = [c for c in all_comps if not c['has8']]
    out = [[bg for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Placement functions called here (see below)
    return out
```
(Top-level structure is solid: separate by has8, init output as bg, place left then right.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified bg=1, extracted components, separated left (with 8) vs right, placed left stacked on cols 0+ with gap logic, right at fixed cols 12/17 based on original minc <=8 threshold, producing exact matches.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated output has misplaced left components—e.g., row 0 starts with five 2s then 1s (expected all 1s then five 2s at end); rows 1-4 have 2,3,3,3,2 + 8s in cols 5-9 but shifted wrong (expected 8s in cols 0-4, then 1s, with 2,3 in cols 17-21); bottom sections like rows 6-8 have 8,6 in cols 0-4 but expected 1s there with 6s shifted right; row 13 has 2,5 in cols 12-16 but expected 1s in cols 0-16 with 2,4 in 17-21—overall, left stacking ignores some vertical alignments/gaps, causing overlap or offset; right placements use fixed cols but threshold misclassifies some components (e.g., original minc >8 but placed at 12).
 * Sorting left_comps by (minr, minc) works for simple cases but fails when components have overlapping row ranges or non-sequential vertical positions in train 3, leading to horizontal crowding instead of proper stacking.
 * Gap logic in place_left_components (if minr > last_maxr +1, reset to col 0; else append to current_width) is partially correct but doesn't handle multi-column resets well, causing left components to bleed into mid-grid (e.g., 8s in cols 5-9 instead of 0-4).
 * Right placement heuristic (col 12 if minc<=8, else 17) works for train 1/2 but in train 3 shifts some right components too left (e.g., 3s/4s appear in cols 17-21 correctly in expected, but generated has them mixed with 2s/5s in cols 12-16); no vertical alignment for right, assuming row-preserved, but bounds check clips edges.
 * No overlaps resolved in placement (code just overwrites if in bounds), but train 3 generated shows no clipping issues—just misalignment.
 * Component extraction is accurate (finds all non-bg blobs with has8 flag), but separation assumes all 8-components are "left" without checking size/connectivity to 8.
 * Unhelpful: No rotation or shape validation functions (not needed, as placements preserve orientation). The current place_right_components is simplistic/heuristic and broken for variable component positions—don't reuse without dynamic col calculation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (plausible as most common); components extracted (e.g., 8s with 4s on left, 1s/7s mid, 2/3/5/6 rightish); left placements (with 8s) stacked in cols 0-4/11-16-ish but irregular—e.g., rows 3-7 have 8,4 in cols 0-4 (good), but row 8 has 8s scattered in cols 11-16 (unexpected shift); row 16 has 2,6,2,3 in cols 11-16 + 8s in 17-20 (mixes left/right logic).
 * Right components placed at ~cols 12-16 (for original leftish) and 17-21 (for rightish), e.g., 2,4 in rows 1-3 cols 12-16 (seems ok), 7s in rows 9-12 cols 12-16 (but original minc may >8, should be 17?), 3s/6s mixed in rows 15-20 cols 11-16/17-20—overlaps or wrong threshold cause 8s to appear in right area (row 20 cols 17-20), violating separation.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have clean left stack (all 8-components in cols 0-~10, vertically gapped, rows preserved); right in 12+ with no 8s leaking; e.g., top 2,4 blob should be right at col 12, bottom 3s at 17, mid 1/7 with 8 at left cols 0-4 rows 8-12. Generated has row 0 all 9s except 2s at 12-16 + end (minor shift ok?), but row 16's 8s in right (wrong—8s must be left); row 21 all 9s good. Overall, ~70% aligned but placement thresholds/gaps fail for dense/multi-level components, similar to train 3 error.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where connected components (objects) of specific colors (e.g., 8 for left-side elements, 2 for right-side elements) are extracted from an input grid, grouped into vertical "blocks" based on row proximity, and rearranged into an output grid with left blocks placed starting from column 0 and right blocks placed at dynamic starting columns (12 or 17) to form a composed image, while preserving the background color. The goal is to correctly position these blocks without overlap or misalignment, likely simulating a puzzle like assembling sprites or icons from a cluttered source into a clean layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most common cell value in the grid; all non-component cells in the output should be filled with this background (e.g., 1 in training example 3, 9 in test).
 * Connected components are defined via flood fill (4-directional adjacency) only for cells matching a seed color (8 for left, 2 for right) and not equal to background; visited tracking prevents re-processing, but extraction must happen separately for left and right to avoid cross-contamination.
 * Components are grouped into "blocks" vertically using a row-overlap threshold (1 for left, -1 for right in this attempt, which may be asymmetric and cause issues); blocks are sorted by min row, and new blocks start if the next component's min row exceeds the current block's max row plus threshold.
 * Placement: Left blocks are placed sequentially from column 0, shifting each component right by (current placement column - its original min column) to pack horizontally without gaps; right blocks use a dynamic start column (12 if any component in block has minc < 9, else 17) to align with a "right panel" layout, but this heuristic fails when components span panel boundaries or have unexpected minc values.
 * Subtle element: Original positions (minc, maxc) influence placement deltas, but output must clip to grid bounds (0 to n-1, here n=22); overwriting is allowed but should not distort shapes—misplacement can cause partial overlaps or shifts (e.g., 2/3 blocks appearing on left in training 3).
 * Color preservation: All cell colors from source components must be copied exactly; no color changes or blending.
 * Grid size is fixed at 22x22; assume square input/output.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side grouping uses negative threshold (-1), which may force tighter grouping than left (threshold 1), leading to over-merging; get_right_start logic assumes a "left panel" ends at col 8-9, but this breaks if components cross panels or if minc is misleading due to flood fill boundaries.
 * Flood fill must exclude background strictly, but include all connected non-bg cells of the seed color—wait, actually, the code flood-fills any non-bg from a seed start, which could pull in multi-color components if adjacent, but in examples, components seem mono-color; this might be a bug if puzzles have mixed-color blobs.
 * No rotation, scaling, or deletion—only translation and packing.
 * Considerations from attempts: Separate visited for left/right extraction to cover whole grid; sort blocks/components by rows/cols for consistent ordering; handle empty blocks gracefully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing components and filling output.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, visited: List[List[bool]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    cells = []
    stack = [(start_r, start_c)]
    visited[start_r][start_c] = True
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        cells.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(This is a standard iterative flood fill for extracting connected non-background regions starting from a seed cell; useful for isolating components, but note it grabs any non-bg adjacent cells, not just same color—may need color restriction for purity.)

```python
def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int, seed_color: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    comps = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] == seed_color and not visited[i][j]:
                cells = flood_fill(g, i, j, visited, bg, n)
                if cells:
                    rs = [r for r, _ in cells]
                    cs = [c for _, c in cells]
                    comps.append({
                        'cells': cells,
                        'minr': min(rs),
                        'maxr': max(rs),
                        'minc': min(cs),
                        'maxc': max(cs)
                    })
    return comps
```
(This extracts bounding boxes and cells for components starting with a seed color, using shared visited; helpful for left/right separation, but could be improved by per-extraction visited resets if needed.)

```python
def group_into_blocks(comps: List[Dict[str, int]], threshold: int) -> List[List[Dict[str, int]]]:
    if not comps:
        return []
    comps = sorted(comps, key=lambda c: c['minr'])
    blocks = []
    current_block = [comps[0]]
    cur_max_r = comps[0]['maxr']
    for comp in comps[1:]:
        if comp['minr'] <= cur_max_r + threshold:
            current_block.append(comp)
            cur_max_r = max(cur_max_r, comp['maxr'])
        else:
            blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [comp]
            cur_max_r = comp['maxr']
    blocks.append(current_block)
    return blocks
```
(This groups components into row-based blocks with a proximity threshold; core for vertical organization, but threshold asymmetry (1 vs -1) in attempt may cause incorrect merging/splitting.)

```python
def place_block(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], block: List[Dict[str, int]], start_col: int, n: int):
    if not block:
        return
    block = sorted(block, key=lambda c: c['minc'])
    curr_col = start_col
    for comp in block:
        delta = curr_col - comp['minc']
        for r, c in comp['cells']:
            new_c = c + delta
            if 0 <= new_c < n:
                out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
        w = comp['maxc'] - comp['minc'] + 1
        curr_col += w
```
(This packs a block horizontally from a start column, preserving relative positions; essential for placement, but delta calculation assumes original minc is relative to a panel—fails if components are not panel-aligned.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely because their components had clean panel separation (minc >=9 for right) and simple vertical grouping, demonstrating core understanding of background detection, component extraction via flood fill, and basic left/right placement.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output has misplaced right-side elements (e.g., row 0 has 2-block at cols 5-9 instead of all 1s until col 17; row 1 has 2/3-block at cols 5-9 instead of 1s, and right 2/3-block starts at col 10 instead of 17), while left 8/2/3 shapes are partially correct but shifted right; expected has clean left panel (cols 0-16 mostly 1/8 with shapes) and right panel (cols 17-21 with 2/3/4/5 blocks)—difference due to get_right_start choosing 12 incorrectly (min_min_c <9 triggers early placement) and possibly over-merging blocks with threshold -1 pulling left/right components together.
 * What worked: Flood fill and extraction accurately captured component cells/bounds in train 3 (e.g., 8-shapes on left rows 1-5 match expected); grouping into blocks succeeded for most vertical stacking; output background fill is correct (all 1s where empty).
 * What didn't work: Right block placement starts too left (at 12 instead of 17), causing overlap/shift of 2/3/4/5 elements into mid-grid (e.g., row 1 expected 2/3 at 17-21, generated at 10-16? partial); negative threshold for right grouping may merge unrelated components vertically; no handling for multi-color components (flood fill grabs adjacent non-bg, but examples seem mono-color so okay); place_block delta doesn't account for panel offsets properly, leading to horizontal shifts.
 * extract_components is essential and worked well for isolating left (seed 8) and right (seed 2) without overlap via shared visited.
 * group_into_blocks is helpful but threshold tuning (1 for left, -1 for right) is subtle/broken—negative threshold forces all into fewer blocks if rows overlap slightly, possibly causing train 3 merge error.
 * get_right_start is an attempt at panel detection but unhelpful/broken: relies on arbitrary <9 check for "left spillover," fails when right components have low minc due to adjacency or irregular shapes (don't use as-is; needs better panel boundary logic, e.g., based on color density).
 * place_block is mostly correct but clips without error, potentially losing parts if delta pushes beyond n (not seen in train 3 but risk in test).
 * Overall problem understanding: Puzzle is about de-cluttering/reassembling left and right "sprites" into side-by-side panels, but subtle panel detection (e.g., col 0-11 left, 12-16? buffer, 17-21 right) and threshold symmetry are missed; no rotation or color mapping, just spatial rearrangement.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the program that failed training 3: e.g., right-side elements (2/3/4 blocks) appear shifted left (row 0 has 2-block at cols 12-16, but likely should be at 17-21 like train 3 expected; row 3 has 2/4/3 mixed starting col 12, overlapping what seems like a left buffer of 9s), and left-side 8/1/7 shapes are placed early (rows 7-12 cols 0-4 correct, but row 6 has 8/2/3 at cols 16-21 which may be right spillover).
 * Background 9 is filled correctly in empties, and some components like 6 in rows 14-17 cols 6-8 look well-extracted/placed, but overall layout has mid-grid clutter (e.g., row 16 has 2/3 at cols 12-16, not pushed right), suggesting get_right_start triggered 12 due to minc <9 on some right component, causing panel overlap—does not match expected clean left (cols 0-11?), buffer, right (17-21) structure inferred from train 3.
 * Test has more colors (9 bg, 8/1 left?, 2/4/6/7/3 right?), and shapes seem vertically grouped (e.g., 2/4/3 stack in rows 1-5 cols 12+), but horizontal packing shifts them leftward incorrectly; no obvious clipping losses, but the entire right panel feels compressed into cols 12-21 instead of 17-21, leaving uneven 9s on far right.
 * To handle test, need to fix right start to always 17 unless specific spillover, and use uniform threshold (e.g., 0 or 1) to avoid over-merging; output makes partial sense (components preserved) but violates panel separation, so incorrect.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 23:26:18] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List, Dict, Set, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def extract_shapes(g: List[List[int]], frame_color: int, bg: int, n: int, excluded: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = None) -> Tuple[List[Dict[str, int]], Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if excluded is None:
        excluded = set()
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    shapes: List[Dict[str, int]] = []

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:27:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 22x22 grid split into left and right sides, where the goal is to extract "framed" shapes (outlines in color 8 on the left, color 2 on the right, with inner filled non-background cells) from each side, group them into horizontal "blocks" based on row overlap, and recombine them into a new grid by aligning left blocks flush left and right blocks flush right, filling the rest with background (0 or 1 depending on the grid).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are defined by connected 4-directional components of frame color (8 left, 2 right); inner areas are 8-directional seeds from frame cells that are non-background and non-frame, then flooded 4-directionally to capture enclosed blobs (e.g., colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9).
 * Exclude already-used cells from the opposite side during extraction to avoid overlap/duplication.
 * Background is the most common color (e.g., 0 in train1/2, 1 in train3); do not treat it as part of shapes.
 * Grouping into blocks: Sort shapes by min row, then merge if a shape's min row <= current block's max row (horizontal stacking in the same "row band").
 * Placement: For each block, sort shapes by min column, compute total width, place left blocks at column 0 (shift by delta to align), right blocks at column n - total_width (shift similarly); only place if new column is in bounds [0,n).
 * Subtleties: Inner flooding must exclude background and frame to avoid leaking; shapes may have multiple inners or be adjacent but not merged if not connected via frame. Placement assumes blocks are row-aligned but can have gaps between shapes in a block. Background fill is uniform. Grids may have varying backgrounds (0 vs 1), and shapes can touch edges but not wrap. Excluded sets prevent double-extraction. Directions: 4 for connectivity (orthogonal), 8 for seeding inners to catch diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Delta shift in placement must be per-shape (cumulative width), not per-block; shapes in a block may not touch horizontally, so total_w is sum of individual widths without gaps. Some shapes might be frame-only (no inner), but still included if connected. Test grids may have more complex enclosures or touching shapes across sides.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List, Dict, Set, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing shapes from fill.)

```python

                    shapes.append({
                        'minr': min(rs),
                        'maxr': max(rs),
                        'minc': min(cs),
                        'maxc': max(cs),
                        'cells': all_cells
                    })
                    for pos in all_cells:
                        used.add(pos)
    return shapes, used
```
(This is core and helpful: correctly finds frame-connected components, seeds and floods inners via 8-dir for enclosure detection, returns bounding boxes and cells; uses excluded to avoid overlap. Works well for isolation but may miss if inners touch frames incorrectly.)

```python
def group_blocks(shapes: List[Dict[str, int]]) -> List[List[Dict[str, int]]]:
    if not shapes:
        return []
    shapes = sorted(shapes, key=lambda s: s['minr'])
    blocks: List[List[Dict[str, int]]] = []
    curr_block = [shapes[0]]
    cur_maxr = shapes[0]['maxr']
    for s in shapes[1:]:
        if s['minr'] <= cur_maxr:
            curr_block.append(s)
            cur_maxr = max(cur_maxr, s['maxr'])
        else:
            blocks.append(curr_block)
            curr_block = [s]
            cur_maxr = s['maxr']
    blocks.append(curr_block)
    return blocks
```
(This groups overlapping-row shapes into horizontal blocks correctly, assuming sorted input; key for row-band alignment.)

```python
def place_blocks(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], blocks: List[List[Dict[str, int]]], n: int, left: bool):
    for block in blocks:
        if not block:
            continue
        block = sorted(block, key=lambda s: s['minc'])
        widths = [s['maxc'] - s['minc'] + 1 for s in block]
        total_w = sum(widths)
        start_col = 0 if left else n - total_w
        cum = 0
        for idx, s in enumerate(block):
            delta = start_col + cum - s['minc']
            for r, c in s['cells']:
                new_c = c + delta
                if 0 <= new_c < n:
                    out[r][new_c] = g[r][c]
            cum += widths[idx]
```
(This places blocks with cumulative shifts and bounds-check; helpful but buggy in delta calc for non-touching shapes, as it assumes no gaps between shapes in block.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided; it correctly extracts and groups shapes in most cases but fails placement alignment for non-contiguous blocks.
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated shifts right-side bottom block leftward (e.g., row13 [0-based] has 2's starting at col2 instead of col12; row14 places 6's at col13-15 but expected at col12-14 with bg shift; row16 has 4's at col18-20 but expected integrated differently; row17 has 2's/4's misplaced). Left side mostly matches, but right extraction/placement ignores some overlaps or deltas wrong (unknown exact cause, possibly inner flooding misses or group_blocks merges incorrectly).
 * Train2 correct: Full match, suggesting core extraction/grouping works for simpler vertical alignments without complex overlaps.
 * Train3 incorrect: Top row (row0) generated has 1's across left/middle but expected 1's only left with 2's right; row1 has 2's frame but 3's inner shifted/misplaced (generated 3's at col6-8, expected col18-20); overall, right shapes like 3's/4's placed too leftward, and bg 1's not preserved in gaps. Likely placement delta over-shifts due to minc calc on full shapes including inners.
 * extract_shapes is essential and mostly correct (handles enclosure well), but inner seeding may include unintended diagonals if frames are thin.
 * group_blocks works for train2 but may over-merge in train1/3 if shapes touch row-edges subtly.
 * place_blocks is broken for cases where shapes in a block have column gaps (total_w sums widths without gaps, but delta uses minc, causing overlap or shift errors; e.g., in train1 row16, 2's and 4's don't abut properly).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but get_background is simple/reliable; overall program demonstrates partial understanding but placement bugs prevent full success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on mental simulation: Left side (cols 0-11) seems to place 8-frames with inners (1's,7's) correctly from apparent left shapes, but right side (cols12+) has 2-frames with 4's/3's/6's placed starting too early (e.g., row0 2's at col12-16 but likely should align further right; row2 2's at col16-21 overlap into bg area; row15 2's/6's at col5-9 seem extracted from left erroneously or shifted wrong). Bottom (row16+) has 8-frames with 3's at col11-15, but expected flush-right alignment for right blocks (e.g., 2's/3's should hug col21 leftward without invading left). Gaps filled with 9 (likely bg), but placements show delta errors similar to train1/3 (over-left shift for right blocks). It partially makes sense for extraction (shapes isolated), but recombination looks misaligned, missing proper total_w handling for gapped blocks; does not account for potential multi-block overlaps or varying bg transitions.
