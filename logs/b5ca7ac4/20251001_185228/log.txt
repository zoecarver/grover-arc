=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 18:52:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:02:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))

                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:

                            break
                    if is_boundary:

                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

[2025-10-01 19:02:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])
                # Find boundary cells
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:06:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential for component detection.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with boundary/frame detection is core and helpful; captures full shape, bounds, and frame accurately for filtering/placement. Use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering placements top-to-bottom, left-to-right.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        # Fallback to first lane
        lane = lanes8[0]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

[2025-10-01 19:06:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python

    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)

                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])

                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

```
(This DFS-based component finder with boundary/frame detection is core and helpful; captures full shape, bounds, and frame accurately for filtering/placement. Use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering placements top-to-bottom, left-to-right.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        # Fallback to first lane
        lane = lanes8[0]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:18:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as mode, essential for component isolation; used in all attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, min_c = j, j  # Note: typo in original, should be min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                # Boundary detection

                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 19:18:50] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are properties and components of the nested squares that exhibit consistent interactions or effects across all train inputs and outputs (and observable in the test input). These are limited to obvious, direct relationships based on the provided data, such as spatial inclusion affecting structure or fixed correlations in size/pixels. Only interactions present in *every* arrangement (inputs and outputs) are included. No high-level puzzle mechanics are inferred or explained; unknown transformations (e.g., why specific positions shift or colors reassigned in outputs) are noted as such. Irrelevant elements (e.g., background color change, total pixel sums, non-interacting standalone shapes without containment) are excluded.

1. **Spatial Position (bbox) → Structural Hierarchy (holes count)**  
   - A shape B is a direct child of shape A if B's bbox is strictly contained within A's bbox (i.e., B's x1 ≥ A's x1, B's x2 ≤ A's x2, B's y1 ≥ A's y1, B's y2 ≤ A's y2).  
   - This inclusion increments A's holes count by exactly 1 per direct child (non-recursive; sub-children of a child do not count toward the parent's holes).  
   - Consistent in every arrangement: Shapes with holes > 0 always have exactly that many direct children (e.g., holes=1 always has 1 child; holes=2 always has 2 children; holes=4 always has 4; holes=6 always has 6). Children are always smaller shapes (holes=0 or sub-frames). No exceptions or over/under-counting observed.  
   - Effect: Determines nesting level; affects the parent's overall structure (larger bbox for higher holes). Standalone shapes (no parent) have no effect on others' holes.

2. **Holes Count → Size/Area (bbox extent and pixels)**  
   - Shapes with holes=0 (inners/fills) always have small bbox extents (width/height ≈2 units) and exactly 9 pixels (solid fill; minor variance to 10 in rare thin cases, but consistently low).  
   - Shapes with holes=1 (basic frames) always have medium bbox extents (width/height ≈4 units) and exactly 16 pixels (border only, excluding child pixels).  
   - Shapes with holes >1 (multi-hole frames) always have larger bbox extents (width/height >4 units, scaling with holes) and pixels >16 (e.g., holes=2 → 32 pixels; holes=4 → 64 pixels; additive pattern of ~16 pixels per hole).  
   - Consistent in every arrangement: Pixels correlate directly with holes (pixels ≈ 16 × holes for frames); bbox size expands to encompass children without overlapping their pixels. No shape with holes >0 has ≤16 pixels, and no holes=0 has >10 pixels.

3. **Color → No Direct Interaction with Other Properties**  
   - Each shape's color (from palette: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, light blue, pink/purple, maroon/dark red) is assigned independently of position, holes, or pixels.  
   - No consistent effect observed: Color does not alter containment (e.g., same-color shapes do not always merge/nest), holes (e.g., no color-specific hole increments), or size (e.g., red frames always 16 pixels regardless of inner color). Parent and child colors differ without pattern.  
   - In outputs, some colors persist on merged/large shapes (e.g., large yellow in train input 2 → large yellow in output 2), but this is not universal (e.g., large red in train input 1 → large maroon/red in output 1). Unknown rule for color reassignment in transformations.

4. **Position (bbox) → Containment Exclusivity**  
   - Bboxes of direct children are always centered/offset within the parent's bbox (e.g., child x1 ≈ parent x1 +1, x2 ≈ parent x2 -1; same for y), with no partial overlaps causing partial holes.  
   - Consistent in every arrangement: No two parents share a child (exclusive containment); overlapping bboxes always result in full inclusion or no nesting. Standalone shapes (not contained) have no position-based effect on others.

### Unknowns/Not Consistently Interconnected
- **Position → Movement/Transformation**: Positions shift between inputs and outputs (e.g., clusters move left/right), but no obvious rule (e.g., proximity to large shapes does not consistently cause merging across all examples). Cannot explain without forcing a non-obvious connection.
- **Holes Count → Color Change**: Large shapes (holes >1) sometimes reduce to holes=0 in outputs (e.g., train input 2 yellow holes=6 → output holes=0; train input 3 blue holes=4 → output holes=0), but pixels/color effects vary (e.g., pixels decrease in one case, stay same in another). Not consistent.
- **Color → Position or Merging**: No evidence that specific color pairs (e.g., red + green) consistently affect relative positions or cause nesting/merging across all arrangements.
- **Pixels → Other Properties**: Total pixels per arrangement vary slightly between input/output (e.g., ~200 → ~191 in train 1), but no consistent interaction (e.g., not tied to color or exact holes total).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 19:20:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])
                # Find boundary cells
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary/frame detection is core and helpful; captures full shape, bounds, and frame accurately for filtering/placement. Use in future.)

```python

```
(Simple but essential for ordering placements top-to-bottom, left-to-right.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]

            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        # Fallback to first lane
        lane = lanes8[0]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are properties and components of the nested squares that exhibit consistent interactions or effects across all train inputs and outputs (and observable in the test input). These are limited to obvious, direct relationships based on the provided data, such as spatial inclusion affecting structure or fixed correlations in size/pixels. Only interactions present in *every* arrangement (inputs and outputs) are included. No high-level puzzle mechanics are inferred or explained; unknown transformations (e.g., why specific positions shift or colors reassigned in outputs) are noted as such. Irrelevant elements (e.g., background color change, total pixel sums, non-interacting standalone shapes without containment) are excluded.

1. **Spatial Position (bbox) → Structural Hierarchy (holes count)**  
   - A shape B is a direct child of shape A if B's bbox is strictly contained within A's bbox (i.e., B's x1 ≥ A's x1, B's x2 ≤ A's x2, B's y1 ≥ A's y1, B's y2 ≤ A's y2).  
   - This inclusion increments A's holes count by exactly 1 per direct child (non-recursive; sub-children of a child do not count toward the parent's holes).  
   - Consistent in every arrangement: Shapes with holes > 0 always have exactly that many direct children (e.g., holes=1 always has 1 child; holes=2 always has 2 children; holes=4 always has 4; holes=6 always has 6). Children are always smaller shapes (holes=0 or sub-frames). No exceptions or over/under-counting observed.  
   - Effect: Determines nesting level; affects the parent's overall structure (larger bbox for higher holes). Standalone shapes (no parent) have no effect on others' holes.

2. **Holes Count → Size/Area (bbox extent and pixels)**  
   - Shapes with holes=0 (inners/fills) always have small bbox extents (width/height ≈2 units) and exactly 9 pixels (solid fill; minor variance to 10 in rare thin cases, but consistently low).  
   - Shapes with holes=1 (basic frames) always have medium bbox extents (width/height ≈4 units) and exactly 16 pixels (border only, excluding child pixels).  
   - Shapes with holes >1 (multi-hole frames) always have larger bbox extents (width/height >4 units, scaling with holes) and pixels >16 (e.g., holes=2 → 32 pixels; holes=4 → 64 pixels; additive pattern of ~16 pixels per hole).  
   - Consistent in every arrangement: Pixels correlate directly with holes (pixels ≈ 16 × holes for frames); bbox size expands to encompass children without overlapping their pixels. No shape with holes >0 has ≤16 pixels, and no holes=0 has >10 pixels.

3. **Color → No Direct Interaction with Other Properties**  
   - Each shape's color (from palette: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, light blue, pink/purple, maroon/dark red) is assigned independently of position, holes, or pixels.  
   - No consistent effect observed: Color does not alter containment (e.g., same-color shapes do not always merge/nest), holes (e.g., no color-specific hole increments), or size (e.g., red frames always 16 pixels regardless of inner color). Parent and child colors differ without pattern.  
   - In outputs, some colors persist on merged/large shapes (e.g., large yellow in train input 2 → large yellow in output 2), but this is not universal (e.g., large red in train input 1 → large maroon/red in output 1). Unknown rule for color reassignment in transformations.

4. **Position (bbox) → Containment Exclusivity**  
   - Bboxes of direct children are always centered/offset within the parent's bbox (e.g., child x1 ≈ parent x1 +1, x2 ≈ parent x2 -1; same for y), with no partial overlaps causing partial holes.  
   - Consistent in every arrangement: No two parents share a child (exclusive containment); overlapping bboxes always result in full inclusion or no nesting. Standalone shapes (not contained) have no position-based effect on others.

### Unknowns/Not Consistently Interconnected
- **Position → Movement/Transformation**: Positions shift between inputs and outputs (e.g., clusters move left/right), but no obvious rule (e.g., proximity to large shapes does not consistently cause merging across all examples). Cannot explain without forcing a non-obvious connection.
- **Holes Count → Color Change**: Large shapes (holes >1) sometimes reduce to holes=0 in outputs (e.g., train input 2 yellow holes=6 → output holes=0; train input 3 blue holes=4 → output holes=0), but pixels/color effects vary (e.g., pixels decrease in one case, stay same in another). Not consistent.
- **Color → Position or Merging**: No evidence that specific color pairs (e.g., red + green) consistently affect relative positions or cause nesting/merging across all arrangements.
- **Pixels → Other Properties**: Total pixels per arrangement vary slightly between input/output (e.g., ~200 → ~191 in train 1), but no consistent interaction (e.g., not tied to color or exact holes total).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:25:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))

                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 19:25:54] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** examples (train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties that reliably interact or affect each other in every case, without forcing unsubstantiated links or attempting to explain full transformations (e.g., exact movement rules or merging triggers are unknown and noted as such). Only relevant, interacting elements are included—irrelevant or standalone elements without consistent connections (e.g., isolated large background elements without clear small-element ties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is implied.

#### 1. **Border Frame and Inner Square (Positional Enclosure Relationship)**
   - **Components Involved**: Border frames (solid color, typically red or maroon; holes=1; pixels=16; bbox width/height ≈4 units) and inner squares (distinct color; holes=0; pixels=9; bbox width/height ≈2-3 units).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Inner square's bbox is always strictly enclosed within a border frame's bbox (inner coordinates subset of border coordinates).
     - This enclosure links the inner to its specific border, forming a consistent pair. The inner's color remains unchanged relative to its border across input and output.
     - Consistent in **every** input and output: No unpaired small inners exist without an enclosing border bbox in the final configuration (stand-alone inners from inputs are always placed inside a border/merged frame in outputs).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position (inner) → Association with border (enclosure defines pairing; no enclosure = no pair).
     - No color change: Border color (e.g., red, maroon) does not affect inner color, and vice versa (pairs like red border + green inner persist without alteration).
   - **Notes**: This is the most direct, consistent interaction. In inputs, pairs are separate components but positionally nested. In outputs, enclosure persists (possibly in merged forms—see below).

#### 2. **Same-Color Border Frames (Merging Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Multiple border frames of the **same color** (e.g., multiple red borders or multiple maroon borders; each starting with holes=1, pixels=16).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Border frames of identical color interact to form a merged frame (single component with expanded bbox).
     - Original associated inners (from each merging border) are relocated inside the merged frame's bbox (preserving enclosure relationship from #1).
     - Trigger for merging is unknown (possibly positional proximity or overlap in inputs, but not consistently explainable from data—e.g., some adjacent same-color borders merge, others do not).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Border color (identical) → Merging (only same-color borders merge; different colors do not interact this way).
     - Number of merging borders (n) → Merged holes (holes = n) and pixels (pixels = n × 16).
     - Merged bbox → Encloses all n original inners (position transformation unknown; inners repositioned inside but retain holes=0, pixels=9, and color).
     - Hole count (merged) = Exact number of enclosed inners (always matches across outputs; e.g., holes=2 encloses 2 inners, holes=4 encloses 4).
   - **Consistency Examples**:
     - Train 1 output: Maroon merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners; red merge (holes=4, pixels=64) encloses 4 inners.
     - Train 2 output: Red merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners; maroon merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners.
     - Train 3 output: Maroon merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners; red merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners.
   - **Notes**: Merging is consistent only for same-color borders and always results in additive holes/pixels tied to enclosed inners. No merging observed for different colors or inners alone. Standalone inners from inputs (no original border) are consistently incorporated into some merged frame (enclosure applies), but assignment rule is unknown.

#### 3. **Hole Count and Enclosure (Structural Property Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Any frame (single or merged; holes ≥1; pixels ≥16) and its enclosed inners (holes=0; pixels=9).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - A frame's hole count directly reflects and affects the number of enclosed inners (enclosure defines the count; more inners → higher holes).
     - This holds post-merging (#2) or for singles: holes=1 always encloses exactly 1 inner.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Hole count (frame) ↔ Number of enclosed inners (bidirectional: enclosure sets holes; holes indicate expected inners).
     - Pixels (frame) → Scaled by hole count (pixels = holes × 16 for frames; inners remain fixed at 9).
   - **Notes**: Consistent in **all** outputs (and inputs for singles). No other properties (e.g., color, exact position) directly alter hole count. Large background elements (e.g., yellow/blue with h>1, p>>16) sometimes exhibit hole changes (e.g., h=6→0), but this is inconsistent (pixels change in some cases, not others) and not tied to small inners reliably—excluded as non-consistent interaction.

#### Excluded or Unknown Elements/Interactions
- **Large Background Elements** (e.g., yellow h=6 p=284 in train 2 input; blue h=4 p=334 in train 3): These span [0,0,21,21] and interact inconsistently (e.g., holes reduce to 0; pixels may decrease slightly or stay same; no reliable tie to small borders/inners across all trains). Possible positional enclosure of inners in some outputs, but unknown and not consistent (e.g., no pixel/hole scaling like small merges). No forced connection.
- **Color → Movement/Transformation**: No consistent effect (e.g., red borders move differently from maroon in some cases, but not explainable or uniform). Colors link pairs (#1) but do not dictate position changes (unknown).
- **Position → Other Properties**: Positions change (e.g., pairs relocate), but transformation rule unknown (e.g., no consistent shift based on bbox coords, holes, or color). Positional enclosure (#1) is the only reliable position-based link.
- **Other Shapes/Properties** (e.g., edges, silhouettes, specific pixel counts like 10 in train 2 output): No consistent interactions; rare anomalies (e.g., p=10 yellow) do not recur across all examples.
- **Inconsistent Pairs**: Some border-inner color combos vary (e.g., maroon + orange in train 1, maroon + blue in train 2), but enclosure (#1) is the consistent connector, not specific colors.

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections; no further links are evident without speculation.

[2025-10-01 19:27:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])
                # Find boundary cells
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:

                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** examples (train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties that reliably interact or affect each other in every case, without forcing unsubstantiated links or attempting to explain full transformations (e.g., exact movement rules or merging triggers are unknown and noted as such). Only relevant, interacting elements are included—irrelevant or standalone elements without consistent connections (e.g., isolated large background elements without clear small-element ties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is implied.

#### 1. **Border Frame and Inner Square (Positional Enclosure Relationship)**
   - **Components Involved**: Border frames (solid color, typically red or maroon; holes=1; pixels=16; bbox width/height ≈4 units) and inner squares (distinct color; holes=0; pixels=9; bbox width/height ≈2-3 units).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Inner square's bbox is always strictly enclosed within a border frame's bbox (inner coordinates subset of border coordinates).
     - This enclosure links the inner to its specific border, forming a consistent pair. The inner's color remains unchanged relative to its border across input and output.
     - Consistent in **every** input and output: No unpaired small inners exist without an enclosing border bbox in the final configuration (stand-alone inners from inputs are always placed inside a border/merged frame in outputs).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position (inner) → Association with border (enclosure defines pairing; no enclosure = no pair).
     - No color change: Border color (e.g., red, maroon) does not affect inner color, and vice versa (pairs like red border + green inner persist without alteration).
   - **Notes**: This is the most direct, consistent interaction. In inputs, pairs are separate components but positionally nested. In outputs, enclosure persists (possibly in merged forms—see below).

#### 2. **Same-Color Border Frames (Merging Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Multiple border frames of the **same color** (e.g., multiple red borders or multiple maroon borders; each starting with holes=1, pixels=16).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Border frames of identical color interact to form a merged frame (single component with expanded bbox).
     - Original associated inners (from each merging border) are relocated inside the merged frame's bbox (preserving enclosure relationship from #1).
     - Trigger for merging is unknown (possibly positional proximity or overlap in inputs, but not consistently explainable from data—e.g., some adjacent same-color borders merge, others do not).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Border color (identical) → Merging (only same-color borders merge; different colors do not interact this way).
     - Number of merging borders (n) → Merged holes (holes = n) and pixels (pixels = n × 16).
     - Merged bbox → Encloses all n original inners (position transformation unknown; inners repositioned inside but retain holes=0, pixels=9, and color).
     - Hole count (merged) = Exact number of enclosed inners (always matches across outputs; e.g., holes=2 encloses 2 inners, holes=4 encloses 4).
   - **Consistency Examples**:
     - Train 1 output: Maroon merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners; red merge (holes=4, pixels=64) encloses 4 inners.
     - Train 2 output: Red merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners; maroon merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners.
     - Train 3 output: Maroon merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners; red merge (holes=2, pixels=32) encloses 2 inners.
   - **Notes**: Merging is consistent only for same-color borders and always results in additive holes/pixels tied to enclosed inners. No merging observed for different colors or inners alone. Standalone inners from inputs (no original border) are consistently incorporated into some merged frame (enclosure applies), but assignment rule is unknown.

#### 3. **Hole Count and Enclosure (Structural Property Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Any frame (single or merged; holes ≥1; pixels ≥16) and its enclosed inners (holes=0; pixels=9).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - A frame's hole count directly reflects and affects the number of enclosed inners (enclosure defines the count; more inners → higher holes).
     - This holds post-merging (#2) or for singles: holes=1 always encloses exactly 1 inner.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Hole count (frame) ↔ Number of enclosed inners (bidirectional: enclosure sets holes; holes indicate expected inners).
     - Pixels (frame) → Scaled by hole count (pixels = holes × 16 for frames; inners remain fixed at 9).
   - **Notes**: Consistent in **all** outputs (and inputs for singles). No other properties (e.g., color, exact position) directly alter hole count. Large background elements (e.g., yellow/blue with h>1, p>>16) sometimes exhibit hole changes (e.g., h=6→0), but this is inconsistent (pixels change in some cases, not others) and not tied to small inners reliably—excluded as non-consistent interaction.

#### Excluded or Unknown Elements/Interactions
- **Large Background Elements** (e.g., yellow h=6 p=284 in train 2 input; blue h=4 p=334 in train 3): These span [0,0,21,21] and interact inconsistently (e.g., holes reduce to 0; pixels may decrease slightly or stay same; no reliable tie to small borders/inners across all trains). Possible positional enclosure of inners in some outputs, but unknown and not consistent (e.g., no pixel/hole scaling like small merges). No forced connection.
- **Color → Movement/Transformation**: No consistent effect (e.g., red borders move differently from maroon in some cases, but not explainable or uniform). Colors link pairs (#1) but do not dictate position changes (unknown).
- **Position → Other Properties**: Positions change (e.g., pairs relocate), but transformation rule unknown (e.g., no consistent shift based on bbox coords, holes, or color). Positional enclosure (#1) is the only reliable position-based link.
- **Other Shapes/Properties** (e.g., edges, silhouettes, specific pixel counts like 10 in train 2 output): No consistent interactions; rare anomalies (e.g., p=10 yellow) do not recur across all examples.
- **Inconsistent Pairs**: Some border-inner color combos vary (e.g., maroon + orange in train 1, maroon + blue in train 2), but enclosure (#1) is the consistent connector, not specific colors.

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections; no further links are evident without speculation.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:30:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []

                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lane = lanes8[0]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

[2025-10-01 19:30:55] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements across **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, bbox/position, pixels) and components (e.g., inners, outers, larger structures) that demonstrably interact or affect each other in a repeatable way. I have excluded anything irrelevant (e.g., background color changes from black to blue, as they are not in the data and do not affect listed elements), inconsistent (e.g., not all large structures have holes matching enclosed item counts), or non-interactive (e.g., isolated positions without containment or merging). No high-level puzzle solution or transformation explanation is provided; unknown aspects (e.g., exact rules for when merging or re-nesting occurs) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Components Involved**
   - **Inner components**: Always holes=0, pixels=9, various colors (e.g., Orange, Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow, Light Blue, Red), small bboxes (typically spanning ~2-3 units in each dimension).
   - **Outer frame components**: Always holes=1, pixels=16, various colors (primarily Red, Maroon; occasionally others), medium bboxes (typically spanning ~4 units in each dimension).
   - **Larger merged structures**: holes ≥2, pixels as multiple of 16 (e.g., 32, 64), same color as merged parts (always Red or Maroon in examples), larger bboxes (spanning multiple small/medium bboxes).
   - **Large background structures** (present in train 2 and 3 only, but interaction consistent where present): holes variable (e.g., 4 or 6), high pixels (e.g., 274-334), colors Yellow or Blue, full-canvas bboxes ([0,0,21,21]).

   *Note*: Single loose inners (no dedicated outer) appear but always interact via enclosure (see below). No other component types (e.g., non-square shapes) interact consistently.

#### 2. **Consistent Interactions and Connections**
   - **Spatial containment (position/bbox → nesting/enclosure)**:
     - The bbox position of every inner component (holes=0, pixels=9) is always fully contained within the bbox of an outer (holes=1, pixels=16) or larger merged structure (holes ≥2). This indicates a direct nesting interaction where the inner's position determines its enclosure by the outer/larger component.
     - Examples across all trains: In train 1 input, Orange [2,2,4,4] contained in Maroon [1,1,5,5]; in train 2 input, Green [15,3,17,5] in Red [14,2,18,6]; in train 3 input, Pink [13,6,15,8] in Maroon [12,5,16,9]. This holds in all outputs too (e.g., train 1 output Green [6,4,8,6] in implied structure).
     - For loose inners (e.g., Pink [1,14,3,16] in train 1 input), their bbox is still contained in a larger structure's bbox (e.g., Red [0,13,9,20]).
     - When a large background is present (train 2/3), all small/medium bboxes are contained within its [0,0,21,21] bbox, indicating global enclosure interaction.
     - Effect: Containment links the inner's position to the enclosing component's structure (e.g., contributes to overall hierarchy), but exact impact on holes/pixels is unknown (inconsistent correlation to count of enclosed items).
     - Consistency: Present in every example; no inner exists without bbox containment by a larger component.

   - **Color-based merging (color + position → combined properties for outers/largers)**:
     - Outer frames (holes=1, pixels=16) of the **same color** interact via proximity in position (bbox overlap or adjacency) to merge into larger structures of the same color. Merged structures have holes = sum of original holes, pixels = sum of original pixels, and a combined bbox covering the originals.
     - Examples across all trains: In train 1 input, two Reds merge into Red (holes=2, pixels=32, [0,13,9,20]); in output, four Reds merge into Red (holes=4, pixels=64, [12,7,21,20]), and two Maroons into Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32). In train 2 output, four Maroons → Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32) + two singles; four Reds → Red (holes=2, pixels=32) + two singles. In train 3 output, three Maroons → Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32) + one single; four Reds → Red (holes=2, pixels=32) + one single + one loose Red inner.
     - Effect: Merging preserves color, adds holes/pixels from components, and expands bbox. Only same-color outers merge (no cross-color merging observed). Inners do not merge with each other or change color.
     - Consistency: Happens in every input/output where multiple same-color outers exist (Red/Maroon only); total count of each color is preserved (e.g., four Reds always sum to four "units" via merges/singles). Unknown: Exact position threshold for triggering merge (proximity is implied but not quantifiable from data).

   - **Color preservation across components (color → no change)**:
     - All components retain their exact color from input to output; no color transformations occur. Inners keep their color regardless of re-nesting, and merged structures inherit the color of the merged outers.
     - Effect: Color acts as an identifier for interactions (e.g., enables same-color merging above; prevents cross-color effects).
     - Consistency: True in every train pair (e.g., all four Reds remain Red; Yellow large stays Yellow).

   - **Hierarchical enclosure by large background (position → partial property change, where present)**:
     - When a large background ([0,0,21,21]) is present, it encloses all other components via bbox containment, interacting with their positions. This affects the background's pixels (slight decrease, e.g., train 2: 284 → 274) and sometimes holes (e.g., train 2: 6 → 0), but the mechanism is unknown.
     - Effect: Enclosure links all positions to the background, potentially adjusting its properties based on enclosed items' arrangement, but no consistent rule for holes/pixels change (e.g., train 3 holes stable at 4).
     - Consistency: Only in train 2/3 (absent in train 1), but interaction (enclosure + property tweak) is identical where present; no effect on enclosed components' properties.

#### 3. **Unknowns (No Consistent Explanation)**
   - How containment exactly affects holes in larger structures (e.g., why train 2 large goes from holes=6 to 0 despite enclosure; why train 3 large stays at 4 with 6 inners).
   - Rules for reassigning inners to different outers/merged structures or making them loose (e.g., why some inners lose dedicated outers in outputs like train 3).
   - Why pixels for large backgrounds change slightly (e.g., -10 in train 2) and if it ties to specific enclosed elements.
   - Any interaction involving new/rare colors (e.g., Dark Red in test; Purple/Magenta not in trains) or non-Red/Maroon outers merging.
   - Position transformations (irregular → structured): Bboxes shift, but no consistent mapping (e.g., no fixed position-to-position or position-to-color effect).

No other connections (e.g., hole count → color, specific shape silhouettes → movement) are obvious or consistent across all examples.

[2025-10-01 19:32:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,

    return components
```
(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lane = lanes8[0]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements across **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, bbox/position, pixels) and components (e.g., inners, outers, larger structures) that demonstrably interact or affect each other in a repeatable way. I have excluded anything irrelevant (e.g., background color changes from black to blue, as they are not in the data and do not affect listed elements), inconsistent (e.g., not all large structures have holes matching enclosed item counts), or non-interactive (e.g., isolated positions without containment or merging). No high-level puzzle solution or transformation explanation is provided; unknown aspects (e.g., exact rules for when merging or re-nesting occurs) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Components Involved**
   - **Inner components**: Always holes=0, pixels=9, various colors (e.g., Orange, Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow, Light Blue, Red), small bboxes (typically spanning ~2-3 units in each dimension).
   - **Outer frame components**: Always holes=1, pixels=16, various colors (primarily Red, Maroon; occasionally others), medium bboxes (typically spanning ~4 units in each dimension).
   - **Larger merged structures**: holes ≥2, pixels as multiple of 16 (e.g., 32, 64), same color as merged parts (always Red or Maroon in examples), larger bboxes (spanning multiple small/medium bboxes).
   - **Large background structures** (present in train 2 and 3 only, but interaction consistent where present): holes variable (e.g., 4 or 6), high pixels (e.g., 274-334), colors Yellow or Blue, full-canvas bboxes ([0,0,21,21]).

   *Note*: Single loose inners (no dedicated outer) appear but always interact via enclosure (see below). No other component types (e.g., non-square shapes) interact consistently.

#### 2. **Consistent Interactions and Connections**
   - **Spatial containment (position/bbox → nesting/enclosure)**:
     - The bbox position of every inner component (holes=0, pixels=9) is always fully contained within the bbox of an outer (holes=1, pixels=16) or larger merged structure (holes ≥2). This indicates a direct nesting interaction where the inner's position determines its enclosure by the outer/larger component.
     - Examples across all trains: In train 1 input, Orange [2,2,4,4] contained in Maroon [1,1,5,5]; in train 2 input, Green [15,3,17,5] in Red [14,2,18,6]; in train 3 input, Pink [13,6,15,8] in Maroon [12,5,16,9]. This holds in all outputs too (e.g., train 1 output Green [6,4,8,6] in implied structure).
     - For loose inners (e.g., Pink [1,14,3,16] in train 1 input), their bbox is still contained in a larger structure's bbox (e.g., Red [0,13,9,20]).
     - When a large background is present (train 2/3), all small/medium bboxes are contained within its [0,0,21,21] bbox, indicating global enclosure interaction.
     - Effect: Containment links the inner's position to the enclosing component's structure (e.g., contributes to overall hierarchy), but exact impact on holes/pixels is unknown (inconsistent correlation to count of enclosed items).
     - Consistency: Present in every example; no inner exists without bbox containment by a larger component.

   - **Color-based merging (color + position → combined properties for outers/largers)**:
     - Outer frames (holes=1, pixels=16) of the **same color** interact via proximity in position (bbox overlap or adjacency) to merge into larger structures of the same color. Merged structures have holes = sum of original holes, pixels = sum of original pixels, and a combined bbox covering the originals.
     - Examples across all trains: In train 1 input, two Reds merge into Red (holes=2, pixels=32, [0,13,9,20]); in output, four Reds merge into Red (holes=4, pixels=64, [12,7,21,20]), and two Maroons into Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32). In train 2 output, four Maroons → Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32) + two singles; four Reds → Red (holes=2, pixels=32) + two singles. In train 3 output, three Maroons → Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32) + one single; four Reds → Red (holes=2, pixels=32) + one single + one loose Red inner.
     - Effect: Merging preserves color, adds holes/pixels from components, and expands bbox. Only same-color outers merge (no cross-color merging observed). Inners do not merge with each other or change color.
     - Consistency: Happens in every input/output where multiple same-color outers exist (Red/Maroon only); total count of each color is preserved (e.g., four Reds always sum to four "units" via merges/singles). Unknown: Exact position threshold for triggering merge (proximity is implied but not quantifiable from data).

   - **Color preservation across components (color → no change)**:
     - All components retain their exact color from input to output; no color transformations occur. Inners keep their color regardless of re-nesting, and merged structures inherit the color of the merged outers.
     - Effect: Color acts as an identifier for interactions (e.g., enables same-color merging above; prevents cross-color effects).
     - Consistency: True in every train pair (e.g., all four Reds remain Red; Yellow large stays Yellow).

   - **Hierarchical enclosure by large background (position → partial property change, where present)**:
     - When a large background ([0,0,21,21]) is present, it encloses all other components via bbox containment, interacting with their positions. This affects the background's pixels (slight decrease, e.g., train 2: 284 → 274) and sometimes holes (e.g., train 2: 6 → 0), but the mechanism is unknown.
     - Effect: Enclosure links all positions to the background, potentially adjusting its properties based on enclosed items' arrangement, but no consistent rule for holes/pixels change (e.g., train 3 holes stable at 4).
     - Consistency: Only in train 2/3 (absent in train 1), but interaction (enclosure + property tweak) is identical where present; no effect on enclosed components' properties.

#### 3. **Unknowns (No Consistent Explanation)**
   - How containment exactly affects holes in larger structures (e.g., why train 2 large goes from holes=6 to 0 despite enclosure; why train 3 large stays at 4 with 6 inners).
   - Rules for reassigning inners to different outers/merged structures or making them loose (e.g., why some inners lose dedicated outers in outputs like train 3).
   - Why pixels for large backgrounds change slightly (e.g., -10 in train 2) and if it ties to specific enclosed elements.
   - Any interaction involving new/rare colors (e.g., Dark Red in test; Purple/Magenta not in trains) or non-Red/Maroon outers merging.
   - Position transformations (irregular → structured): Bboxes shift, but no consistent mapping (e.g., no fixed position-to-position or position-to-color effect).

No other connections (e.g., hole count → color, specific shape silhouettes → movement) are obvious or consistent across all examples.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:40:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; useful across all examples.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                # Find boundary cells
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 19:42:18] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle (i.e., present in all inputs and all corresponding outputs). These are limited to direct, observable relationships between elements (e.g., via position, properties like holes/pixels, or containment) that appear in 100% of cases without exception. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., standalone background color change without element interaction, inconsistent big-canvas elements' pixel-hole formulas, or non-nested smalls) are included. Connections that cannot be consistently explained (e.g., exact color changes during transformation, precise reasons for position shifts, or big-canvas hole-pixel mismatches) are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Spatial Containment (Position → Containment in Larger Element)**
   - **Description**: Every small element (0 holes, 9-10 pixels, bbox width/height ≈2-4 units) has its bounding box completely contained within the bounding box of exactly one larger element (holes ≥1, pixels ≥16, bbox width/height ≈4+ units). No small element is ever positioned outside all larger elements' bboxes.
   - **Interacting Components**: Small elements (various colors: e.g., Orange, Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow) and their containing larger element (colors: e.g., Red, Maroon).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in 100% of small elements across all train inputs and outputs (e.g., 8+ smalls per image, all nested). This nesting links position of small to position of its container—smalls do not appear "free-floating" relative to larges.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The containment suggests positional dependency; nested smalls move/reposition along with their container in outputs (e.g., a small's relative position inside a large's bbox is preserved or adjusted as a group). Exact transformation rules (e.g., why some nestings persist vs. change) unknown.
   - **Examples Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 input/output: All 7 smalls (e.g., Orange [2,2,4,4] inside Maroon [1,1,5,5]) nested.
     - Train 2 input/output: All 8 smalls (e.g., Light Blue [3,3,5,5] inside Maroon [2,2,6,6]) nested.
     - Train 3 input/output: All 6 smalls (e.g., Green [13,1,15,3] inside Red [12,0,16,4]) nested.

#### 2. **Holes-Pixels Relationship in Larger Elements (Shape Property → Size Property)**
   - **Description**: For all non-canvas-filling larger elements (holes ≥1, bbox not spanning full [0,0,21,21]), pixels = 16 × holes exactly.
   - **Interacting Components**: The larger element itself (self-interaction via intrinsic properties); often contains 1+ nested smalls (see #1), but the formula holds independently of contained smalls' details.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to 100% of qualifying larger elements (1-4 holes) across all train inputs and outputs. Does not apply to canvas-filling elements (e.g., Yellow holes=6 pixels=284 in train 2 input), which follow an unknown separate rule.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Hole count directly determines pixel count, suggesting holes affect the "filled" area or silhouette complexity of the larger element (e.g., more holes = proportionally more pixels, implying additive structure like merged frames). This is independent of color or position but links to nesting (#1) as multi-hole larges always contain multiple smalls.
   - **Examples Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 input: Red (holes=2, pixels=32 = 16×2).
     - Train 1 output: Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32), Red (holes=4, pixels=64 = 16×4).
     - Train 2 output: Red (holes=2, pixels=32), Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32).
     - Train 3 output: Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32), Red (holes=2, pixels=32).
     - All 1-hole larges (pixels=16 = 16×1) follow this in every image.

#### 3. **Nesting Density in Multi-Hole Larges (Containment Count → Holes)**
   - **Description**: Larger elements with holes >1 always contain multiple (≥2) small elements via bbox nesting (#1). Single-hole larges contain exactly 1 small.
   - **Interacting Components**: Multi-hole larger element (e.g., Red holes=2 or 4) and its 2+ contained smalls (various colors).
   - **Consistency**: 100% of multi-hole larges (when present) across all train inputs and outputs exhibit this; no multi-hole large contains 0 or 1 small, and no single-small nesting produces >1 hole.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Number of contained smalls appears to influence or correlate with hole count (e.g., more nested smalls → more holes), linking containment (#1) to shape transformation. However, exact mapping is not always 1:1 (e.g., train 2 output Red holes=2 contains 3 smalls), so precise effect unknown—may involve color or position filters on which smalls "count" toward holes.
   - **Examples Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 input: Red (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Pink, Yellow).
     - Train 1 output: Maroon (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Orange, Green); Red (holes=4) contains 4 smalls (Green, Light Blue, Pink, Yellow).
     - Train 2 output: Red (holes=2) contains 3 smalls (Yellow, Orange, Green); Maroon (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Blue, Pink).
     - Train 3 output: Maroon (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Red, Pink); Red (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Orange, Yellow).

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Connections Noted
- **Color → Transformation**: Colors of nested small and large (e.g., Red containing Blue) show no consistent effect on output color, position, or holes across all cases (e.g., sometimes large color persists, sometimes changes; unknown rule).
- **Big-Canvas Elements → Anything**: Canvas-spanning elements (e.g., Yellow holes=6 in train 2 input, Blue holes=4 in train 3 input) always contain all other elements via bbox but have irregular holes-pixels (not 16×holes) and transform to holes=0 without consistent pixel change (284→274 in train 2, 334→334 in train 3). No clear interaction with non-big elements beyond universal containment; exact role unknown.
- **Position → Specific Movement**: Nested groups reposition in outputs (e.g., from scattered to aligned), but no consistent rule (e.g., color-based sorting or hole-based shifting) applies to every case.
- No other properties (e.g., bbox edges, silhouettes, maroon variants) show consistent interactions across all puzzles without exceptions.

These are the only connections that hold universally. No forced or irregular links (e.g., irrelevant standalone smalls, which do not exist) are included.

[2025-10-01 19:42:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])

                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)

        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; useful across all examples.)

(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

```python

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle (i.e., present in all inputs and all corresponding outputs). These are limited to direct, observable relationships between elements (e.g., via position, properties like holes/pixels, or containment) that appear in 100% of cases without exception. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., standalone background color change without element interaction, inconsistent big-canvas elements' pixel-hole formulas, or non-nested smalls) are included. Connections that cannot be consistently explained (e.g., exact color changes during transformation, precise reasons for position shifts, or big-canvas hole-pixel mismatches) are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Spatial Containment (Position → Containment in Larger Element)**
   - **Description**: Every small element (0 holes, 9-10 pixels, bbox width/height ≈2-4 units) has its bounding box completely contained within the bounding box of exactly one larger element (holes ≥1, pixels ≥16, bbox width/height ≈4+ units). No small element is ever positioned outside all larger elements' bboxes.
   - **Interacting Components**: Small elements (various colors: e.g., Orange, Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow) and their containing larger element (colors: e.g., Red, Maroon).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in 100% of small elements across all train inputs and outputs (e.g., 8+ smalls per image, all nested). This nesting links position of small to position of its container—smalls do not appear "free-floating" relative to larges.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The containment suggests positional dependency; nested smalls move/reposition along with their container in outputs (e.g., a small's relative position inside a large's bbox is preserved or adjusted as a group). Exact transformation rules (e.g., why some nestings persist vs. change) unknown.
   - **Examples Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 input/output: All 7 smalls (e.g., Orange [2,2,4,4] inside Maroon [1,1,5,5]) nested.
     - Train 2 input/output: All 8 smalls (e.g., Light Blue [3,3,5,5] inside Maroon [2,2,6,6]) nested.
     - Train 3 input/output: All 6 smalls (e.g., Green [13,1,15,3] inside Red [12,0,16,4]) nested.

#### 2. **Holes-Pixels Relationship in Larger Elements (Shape Property → Size Property)**
   - **Description**: For all non-canvas-filling larger elements (holes ≥1, bbox not spanning full [0,0,21,21]), pixels = 16 × holes exactly.
   - **Interacting Components**: The larger element itself (self-interaction via intrinsic properties); often contains 1+ nested smalls (see #1), but the formula holds independently of contained smalls' details.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to 100% of qualifying larger elements (1-4 holes) across all train inputs and outputs. Does not apply to canvas-filling elements (e.g., Yellow holes=6 pixels=284 in train 2 input), which follow an unknown separate rule.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Hole count directly determines pixel count, suggesting holes affect the "filled" area or silhouette complexity of the larger element (e.g., more holes = proportionally more pixels, implying additive structure like merged frames). This is independent of color or position but links to nesting (#1) as multi-hole larges always contain multiple smalls.
   - **Examples Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 input: Red (holes=2, pixels=32 = 16×2).
     - Train 1 output: Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32), Red (holes=4, pixels=64 = 16×4).
     - Train 2 output: Red (holes=2, pixels=32), Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32).
     - Train 3 output: Maroon (holes=2, pixels=32), Red (holes=2, pixels=32).
     - All 1-hole larges (pixels=16 = 16×1) follow this in every image.

#### 3. **Nesting Density in Multi-Hole Larges (Containment Count → Holes)**
   - **Description**: Larger elements with holes >1 always contain multiple (≥2) small elements via bbox nesting (#1). Single-hole larges contain exactly 1 small.
   - **Interacting Components**: Multi-hole larger element (e.g., Red holes=2 or 4) and its 2+ contained smalls (various colors).
   - **Consistency**: 100% of multi-hole larges (when present) across all train inputs and outputs exhibit this; no multi-hole large contains 0 or 1 small, and no single-small nesting produces >1 hole.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Number of contained smalls appears to influence or correlate with hole count (e.g., more nested smalls → more holes), linking containment (#1) to shape transformation. However, exact mapping is not always 1:1 (e.g., train 2 output Red holes=2 contains 3 smalls), so precise effect unknown—may involve color or position filters on which smalls "count" toward holes.
   - **Examples Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 input: Red (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Pink, Yellow).
     - Train 1 output: Maroon (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Orange, Green); Red (holes=4) contains 4 smalls (Green, Light Blue, Pink, Yellow).
     - Train 2 output: Red (holes=2) contains 3 smalls (Yellow, Orange, Green); Maroon (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Blue, Pink).
     - Train 3 output: Maroon (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Red, Pink); Red (holes=2) contains 2 smalls (Orange, Yellow).

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Connections Noted
- **Color → Transformation**: Colors of nested small and large (e.g., Red containing Blue) show no consistent effect on output color, position, or holes across all cases (e.g., sometimes large color persists, sometimes changes; unknown rule).
- **Big-Canvas Elements → Anything**: Canvas-spanning elements (e.g., Yellow holes=6 in train 2 input, Blue holes=4 in train 3 input) always contain all other elements via bbox but have irregular holes-pixels (not 16×holes) and transform to holes=0 without consistent pixel change (284→274 in train 2, 334→334 in train 3). No clear interaction with non-big elements beyond universal containment; exact role unknown.
- **Position → Specific Movement**: Nested groups reposition in outputs (e.g., from scattered to aligned), but no consistent rule (e.g., color-based sorting or hole-based shifting) applies to every case.
- No other properties (e.g., bbox edges, silhouettes, maroon variants) show consistent interactions across all puzzles without exceptions.

These are the only connections that hold universally. No forced or irregular links (e.g., irrelevant standalone smalls, which do not exist) are included.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:46:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 1 or 9 in examples.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()

                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:

                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lidx = 0
        lane = lanes8[lidx]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** input and output pair. These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably relate or affect each other in all cases (e.g., via containment, merging, or transformation). Irrelevant elements (e.g., background color change alone, without component interaction), inconsistent ones (e.g., whole-covering component hole counts or pixel changes in outputs), or forced/unknown relations (e.g., specific movement rules for positions) are excluded. Only direct, verifiable links are included; unexplained transformations (e.g., why specific outers merge) are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Containment Relation (Position -> Holes)**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner components (h=0, pixels=9, bbox dimensions ~2x2 units) and outer components (h>=1, pixels>=16, bbox dimensions ~4xN units or larger).
   - **Interaction**: Every inner component's bbox is fully contained within exactly one outer component's bbox. This is positional: the inner is placed inside the outer without bbox overlap with other outers.
     - Consistent in all inputs/outputs: No inner is ever "loose" (outside all outers); no outer contains an inner from another outer's prior containment.
   - **Effect**: The outer's `holes` value directly reflects the number of inners it contains (1:1 mapping).
     - For non-merged (small) outers: Always h=1 containing exactly 1 inner.
     - For merged outers: h = total inners contained (e.g., h=2 for 2 inners, h=4 for 4 inners).
     - Consistent in all examples for all non-whole-covering outers (small or merged). Whole-covering outers (e.g., [0,0,21,21]) have unknown hole->inner relation in inputs (e.g., h=4 with 6 inners in Train 3 input); in outputs, they transform to h=0 (no containment effect).
   - **Properties Linked**: Position (bbox of inner relative to outer) affects holes (of outer). No other properties (e.g., color, pixels) alter this.

#### 2. **Merging of Outers (Color + Position -> Size/Holes/Pixels/Bbox)**
   - **Components Involved**: Multiple outer components of the **same color** (e.g., multiple Reds or Maroons).
   - **Interaction**: Outers of identical color merge into a single outer component if their positions allow grouping (bboxes become adjacent/encompassing post-merge). This is a transformation that combines them; non-same-color outers never merge.
     - Consistent in all examples: Merging only occurs within same-color groups (e.g., Reds merge with Reds only). Some same-color outers remain unmerged (unknown rule for which; e.g., 4 input Reds become 1x h=1 + 1x h=4 in Train 1 output).
     - No merging of inners (inners stay separate).
   - **Effects**:
     - `holes`: Sum of pre-merge holes (e.g., two h=1 outers merge to h=2).
     - `pixels`: Sum of pre-merge pixels (e.g., two p=16 outers merge to p=32; four to p=64). Consistent for all merged outers.
     - `bbox`: Expands to encompass all pre-merge bboxes + contained inners (larger size, e.g., from 4x4 to 9x13).
     - Position: The merged outer's bbox position shifts (unknown exact rule; affects overall layout but preserves containment of original inners or reassigns them consistently within the group).
   - **Properties Linked**: Color (must match for merging) + position (proximity/encompassing enables merge) -> holes, pixels, bbox (size/expansion). Inners contained in pre-merge outers stay contained post-merge (or are reassigned within the same-color group).

#### 3. **Inner Preservation and Reassignment (Containment -> Position)**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner components only (h=0, pixels=9).
   - **Interaction**: Inners do not change type or merge; they are reassigned to new outers during transformation. Reassignment is constrained by the outer merging (above): an inner originally in one outer of a color group may move to another outer in the same merged group or a different same-color outer.
     - Consistent in all examples: Inners never become outers or change color/size. All inners remain fully contained post-transformation (see Containment above). Reassignment can group previously separate inners into one outer (e.g., 2 loose inners + 2 paired inners into 1 h=4 outer in Train 1).
   - **Effects**:
     - Position: Bbox shifts to new location within a containing outer (often centered for h=1 outers; offset for h>1). Unknown rule for exact target outer/color preference.
     - No effect on outer holes (handled by containment count).
   - **Properties Linked**: Position (reassigned within containment) affected by outer merging (color group). Color of inner has no obvious consistent effect on reassignment target (e.g., green inners go to maroon or red outers across examples).

#### Notes on Unknown/Inconsistent Elements
- **Whole-Covering Components** (e.g., h=6 Yellow in Train 2 input): Transform to h=0 in outputs (unknown reason; possibly interacts with background to "fill" holes). Pixels may decrease slightly and split a small same-color piece (e.g., p=10 Yellow in Train 2 output; inconsistent, as Train 3 has no split). Not reliably connected to other components across all examples.
- **Specific Position Rules**: Positions change (e.g., left-to-right shifts), but no consistent trigger (e.g., color -> direction) identifiable without forcing; called unknown.
- **Pixel Counts for Small Components**: Fixed (inners=9, small h=1 outers=16) and consistent; no interactions alter them individually.
- **Colors**: No changes or interactions (e.g., no color-based movement consistent across all; e.g., blue inners stay with red outers in some, not others).
- No other properties (e.g., edges, silhouettes, hole count -> color) show consistent interactions; e.g., no evidence of color affecting movement direction in every example.

These connections form the core "interconnected components" graph: inners link to outers via containment; same-color outers link via merging; transformations propagate position/holes/pixels through these links.

[2025-10-01 19:49:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])
                # Find boundary cells
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 1 or 9 in examples.)

```python

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom placement order.)

```python

    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lidx = 0
        lane = lanes8[lidx]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** input and output pair. These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably relate or affect each other in all cases (e.g., via containment, merging, or transformation). Irrelevant elements (e.g., background color change alone, without component interaction), inconsistent ones (e.g., whole-covering component hole counts or pixel changes in outputs), or forced/unknown relations (e.g., specific movement rules for positions) are excluded. Only direct, verifiable links are included; unexplained transformations (e.g., why specific outers merge) are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Containment Relation (Position -> Holes)**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner components (h=0, pixels=9, bbox dimensions ~2x2 units) and outer components (h>=1, pixels>=16, bbox dimensions ~4xN units or larger).
   - **Interaction**: Every inner component's bbox is fully contained within exactly one outer component's bbox. This is positional: the inner is placed inside the outer without bbox overlap with other outers.
     - Consistent in all inputs/outputs: No inner is ever "loose" (outside all outers); no outer contains an inner from another outer's prior containment.
   - **Effect**: The outer's `holes` value directly reflects the number of inners it contains (1:1 mapping).
     - For non-merged (small) outers: Always h=1 containing exactly 1 inner.
     - For merged outers: h = total inners contained (e.g., h=2 for 2 inners, h=4 for 4 inners).
     - Consistent in all examples for all non-whole-covering outers (small or merged). Whole-covering outers (e.g., [0,0,21,21]) have unknown hole->inner relation in inputs (e.g., h=4 with 6 inners in Train 3 input); in outputs, they transform to h=0 (no containment effect).
   - **Properties Linked**: Position (bbox of inner relative to outer) affects holes (of outer). No other properties (e.g., color, pixels) alter this.

#### 2. **Merging of Outers (Color + Position -> Size/Holes/Pixels/Bbox)**
   - **Components Involved**: Multiple outer components of the **same color** (e.g., multiple Reds or Maroons).
   - **Interaction**: Outers of identical color merge into a single outer component if their positions allow grouping (bboxes become adjacent/encompassing post-merge). This is a transformation that combines them; non-same-color outers never merge.
     - Consistent in all examples: Merging only occurs within same-color groups (e.g., Reds merge with Reds only). Some same-color outers remain unmerged (unknown rule for which; e.g., 4 input Reds become 1x h=1 + 1x h=4 in Train 1 output).
     - No merging of inners (inners stay separate).
   - **Effects**:
     - `holes`: Sum of pre-merge holes (e.g., two h=1 outers merge to h=2).
     - `pixels`: Sum of pre-merge pixels (e.g., two p=16 outers merge to p=32; four to p=64). Consistent for all merged outers.
     - `bbox`: Expands to encompass all pre-merge bboxes + contained inners (larger size, e.g., from 4x4 to 9x13).
     - Position: The merged outer's bbox position shifts (unknown exact rule; affects overall layout but preserves containment of original inners or reassigns them consistently within the group).
   - **Properties Linked**: Color (must match for merging) + position (proximity/encompassing enables merge) -> holes, pixels, bbox (size/expansion). Inners contained in pre-merge outers stay contained post-merge (or are reassigned within the same-color group).

#### 3. **Inner Preservation and Reassignment (Containment -> Position)**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner components only (h=0, pixels=9).
   - **Interaction**: Inners do not change type or merge; they are reassigned to new outers during transformation. Reassignment is constrained by the outer merging (above): an inner originally in one outer of a color group may move to another outer in the same merged group or a different same-color outer.
     - Consistent in all examples: Inners never become outers or change color/size. All inners remain fully contained post-transformation (see Containment above). Reassignment can group previously separate inners into one outer (e.g., 2 loose inners + 2 paired inners into 1 h=4 outer in Train 1).
   - **Effects**:
     - Position: Bbox shifts to new location within a containing outer (often centered for h=1 outers; offset for h>1). Unknown rule for exact target outer/color preference.
     - No effect on outer holes (handled by containment count).
   - **Properties Linked**: Position (reassigned within containment) affected by outer merging (color group). Color of inner has no obvious consistent effect on reassignment target (e.g., green inners go to maroon or red outers across examples).

#### Notes on Unknown/Inconsistent Elements
- **Whole-Covering Components** (e.g., h=6 Yellow in Train 2 input): Transform to h=0 in outputs (unknown reason; possibly interacts with background to "fill" holes). Pixels may decrease slightly and split a small same-color piece (e.g., p=10 Yellow in Train 2 output; inconsistent, as Train 3 has no split). Not reliably connected to other components across all examples.
- **Specific Position Rules**: Positions change (e.g., left-to-right shifts), but no consistent trigger (e.g., color -> direction) identifiable without forcing; called unknown.
- **Pixel Counts for Small Components**: Fixed (inners=9, small h=1 outers=16) and consistent; no interactions alter them individually.
- **Colors**: No changes or interactions (e.g., no color-based movement consistent across all; e.g., blue inners stay with red outers in some, not others).
- No other properties (e.g., edges, silhouettes, hole count -> color) show consistent interactions; e.g., no evidence of color affecting movement direction in every example.

These connections form the core "interconnected components" graph: inners link to outers via containment; same-color outers link via merging; transformations propagate position/holes/pixels through these links.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:55:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Sorts components by top-left position (min_r, then min_c)."""
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

[2025-10-01 19:55:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])
                # Find boundary cells
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)

        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; useful across all examples.)

    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)

                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,

                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom placement order.)

```python

    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lidx = 0
        lane = lanes8[lidx]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:58:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the filler color, e.g., 1 or 9 in examples; essential first step.)

```python

(This DFS-based extraction with boundary/frame computation is core and works well for identifying objects; includes bounds for placement. Dict structure enables easy sorting and shifting.)

```
(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

[2025-10-01 19:58:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                            colors.add(g[nr][nc])
                # Find boundary cells
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; useful across all examples.)

    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]

(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])

    if not placed:

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the filler color, e.g., 1 or 9 in examples; essential first step.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]

                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,

(This DFS-based extraction with boundary/frame computation is core and works well for identifying objects; includes bounds for placement. Dict structure enables easy sorting and shifting.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for processing order.)

```python

    candidates = [current_lane, other_lane]
    placed = False
    placed_lane = None
    for lane in candidates:
        lidx = lanes8.index(lane)
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied[lidx])
        if not overlaps:

                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            placed_lane = lane
            break
    if not placed:
        lane = lanes8[0]
        lidx = 0
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']

```
(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:01:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies background as mode color; used successfully in all examples.)

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

[2025-10-01 20:01:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []

                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:

                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:

                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; useful across all examples.)

                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies background as mode color; used successfully in all examples.)

```python

    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

                    for dr, dc in directions:

                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))

                    for dr, dc in directions:

                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:06:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

[2025-10-01 20:06:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)

        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:

                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)

```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; useful across all examples.)

                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)

                    'component': component,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential and correct.)

    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

```python

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))

(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lidx = 0
        lane = lanes8[lidx]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

```

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 20:10:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common value; essential and correct across attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

[2025-10-01 20:10:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                colors: Set[int] = set([g[i][j]])
                while stack:

                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))

                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                # Frame color: most common in boundary
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    frame = max(colors, key=colors.count)  # Fallback, but potentially unreliable
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]

                    'max_r': max_r,

```
(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

```python

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lidx = 0
        lane = lanes8[lidx]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']

            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

```

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 20:13:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent pixel colors, requiring the extraction of connected components (objects or blobs) excluding the background, identification of a "frame" color for each component based on boundary cells, and rearrangement of these components into fixed "lanes" (columns or positions) in a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to simulate assembling puzzle pieces into a standardized layout, likely for a game or matching challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to find connected non-background cells; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement.
 * Frame color is determined from the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use the most common color in the whole component.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain input order.
 * Placement rules: 8-framed components go into specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5, grouped by vertical adjacency into blocks and cycled across lanes); 2-framed into lanes like 12 or 17 based on original position; other frames may need different handling (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 not fully addressed).
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed column offsets; shift entire component horizontally by dx = target_lane - min_c, but only place if nc in bounds (0 to n-1); vertical position stays the same as original.
 * Grouping for 8s: Vertically adjacent components (min_r <= prev_max_r +1) form "blocks" placed alternately in lanes; non-adjacent start new blocks.
 * Easy to miss: Boundaries include out-of-grid adjacencies; components with no explicit boundary might default incorrectly; 1s seem to be background in some cases but not always; test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1).
 * All other non-8/2 components (e.g., framed with 3,4,5,6) are not placed in this attempt, leading to missing elements.
 * Preserve exact shapes: Overwrite output only where placing, no rotation/scaling.
 * n=22 in examples, but generalize to any n.
 * Potential overlap: Placement might overwrite if lanes conflict, but examples avoid it.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background as most common color; useful and accurate.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is essential: correctly extracts components, computes bounding boxes, and determines frame via boundary analysis; handles edge cases like no boundary; use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful for ordering components by position; preserves input layout order.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Core placement function; shifts horizontally while keeping rows fixed; bounds-check prevents overflow; reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for 8s (lanes 0/5, grouped blocks) and 2s (lanes 12/17 based on original min_c <=8 or >8) worked perfectly, including background fill with 1s.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., row 0 has [2,2,2,2,2,1,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,2,2]; rows 1-4 have 8s and 2s/3s shifted left with extra 2s in columns 0-4 where expected has 8s and 1s; row 6 has [8,6,6,6,8,1,...] but expected has [1,1,1,1,1,8,6,...] (6s shifted right into lane 6); rows 13-21 mostly match but top has anomalies; overall, 8-block grouping failed for upper components, treating them as separate and placing in wrong lanes, and 3-framed components (e.g., the 3s in expected rows 1-4 col 18-20) not placed at all (missing in generated).
 * 2-framed placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) worked in trains 1-2 but may overgeneralize; in train 3, it placed some 2s incorrectly in upper rows.
 * No handling for other frames (3,4,5,6): These are extracted but never placed, causing missing elements like the 3s,4s,5s,6s in expected train 3 (e.g., 3s in rows 15-17 cols 18-20, 4s in row 13 cols 18-20, 5s in rows 9-11 cols 13-15, 6s in rows 6-8 cols 6-8).
 * place_eights groups vertically adjacent 8-comps into blocks and cycles lanes 0/5, which succeeded in trains 1-2 but failed in train 3 by not grouping a upper block properly (placed small 8s/2s mix in cols 0-4 instead of full 8-frame in cols 0-4).
 * Background correctly 1 in trains, but placement overwrites incorrectly without preserving empty lanes fully.
 * No rotation or vertical shift; assumes original rows preserved, which matches expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It shows background 9 (plausible if most common), with 8-framed components placed in lanes 0/5 (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 has 8/4s, rows 8-12 cols 1-4 has 8/7s/1s, rows 16-20 cols 5-9 has 8/3s), 2-framed in lanes ~12-17 (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 12-16 has 2/4s, rows 13-17 cols 12-16 has 2/6s/3s), which aligns with rules; however, other frames like 1,3,4,6,7 are placed inconsistently or not at all (e.g., 7s in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 but expected likely needs them in a dedicated lane like 6-8; 1s scattered as if background but sometimes framed; 3s in row 16 col 13-15 and row 17 col 12-14 seem shifted wrong, possibly from unhandled 3-frame logic).
 * Missing elements: No clear placement for 5,6,7 frames (e.g., 6s in rows 14-16 cols 1-3 and row 16 col 12-14 look like partial 6-blobs, but expected probably groups them into lane 6 or similar); upper rows 0-2 have 2/4s in col 12-16 and 8/4s misplaced in row 3 col 0-4, suggesting 4-framed not handled (similar to train 3's missing 4s).
 * Overlaps or gaps: Rows 12-13 cols 0-4 empty-ish with 2s/8s bleeding; row 21 all 9s ok, but test likely expects fuller lanes for all frames (e.g., 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s in sequential lanes like 12,17,6, etc.); differences from expected unknown without input grid, but pattern mismatches train 3 errors (unplaced non-2/8 frames, bad grouping), so probably incorrect for similar reasons—e.g., 4s in row 0 col 13-15 and row 3 col 1-3 should be in a right-side lane, not split.

[2025-10-01 20:13:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify and extract connected components (non-background shapes) based on their boundary "frame" colors (specifically 8 for "eight-shapes" and 2 for "two-shapes"), then rearrange and place these components into fixed horizontal lanes on a new output grid filled with the background color, preserving their internal structure but shifting them horizontally to align with lane positions like 0/5 for eight-shapes and 12/17 for two-shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid, used to fill the output and ignore during component detection.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), cells, and colors.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—but this fallback may be unreliable if components have uniform colors.
 * Only components with frame color exactly 8 (eight-shapes) or 2 (two-shapes) are extracted and placed; others are omitted entirely from the output.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) before placement to maintain relative order.
 * Placement for eight-shapes uses lanes 0 (left) or 5 (right-ish); it checks for vertical overlap (row range intersection) with already-placed shapes and shifts to the non-overlapping lane if possible, using dx = lane - min_c; clipping occurs if shift goes out of bounds (0 to n-1).
 * Placement for two-shapes uses lanes 17 (right) and 12 (left-of-right); it tries lanes in order (starting with 17, then 12), checks if the shifted bounding box fits within grid columns, falls back to the other lane if needed, but allows clipping if neither fits; no overlap check between two-shapes or with eight-shapes.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes—only horizontal translation; vertical positions (rows) are preserved exactly.
 * Subtlety: Overlap detection for eight-shapes is only vertical (row ranges), ignoring columns, which can lead to horizontal overlaps or misplacements if lanes are too close.
 * Subtlety: In find_components, the stack-based flood fill marks visited and collects cells/colors correctly, but boundary detection iterates over all directions including edges, which is accurate but computationally heavy for large n.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns, and placement dx is based on min_c alignment to lane, so wide components may clip or overlap unintentionally.
 * Easy to miss: If multiple components have the same frame color, they are placed in sorted order, but lane selection for eight-shapes depends on prior placements' row overlaps, creating dependency.
 * Consideration: Grid size n=22 in examples; assume square grid; colors are integers 1-9 likely.
 * Consideration: Output must exactly match expected, including background fills; any misplaced cell (e.g., wrong lane, clipping error) fails.
 * Across attempts: No handling for components with mixed frames or non-frame components that might need omission; placement doesn't clear prior overlaps (overwrites output, but since background init, it's additive).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the background as the mode color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

(This flood-fill extracts components accurately with bounding boxes and frame colors; core to identifying eight/two-shapes; boundary detection is correct but fallback frame may misclassify isolated components.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; preserves discovery order for placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed completely, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) work for simple cases without overlaps or clipping.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated places some two-shapes (e.g., row 0 ends with five 2's instead of starting around col 12; row 2 has 2's in cols 12-16 but expected shifts them rightward; row 4 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,2,2,2,2 there and 3's elsewhere; row 5 has 2's and 3's misplaced vs. expected 4's and 3's shifted) and eight-shapes (e.g., row 15 has 2,1,1,1,2 in cols 12-17 but expected 2,1,1,1,2 with 1's in different positions? Wait, actually row 15 generated has 4's where expected has 4's but 1's placement off)—differences suggest faulty lane selection or dx calculation for two-shapes, possibly trying wrong initial lane or ignoring fit checks, leading to clipping or overlap without fallback.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated has major row shifts, e.g., row 0 has 2's at start but expected 1's background with 2's at end; row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 early but expected 8's and 2,3's at end; row 8 has 8,6's but then 1's and 2's misplaced (e.g., 2,5,5,5,2 in col 17 but expected in col 12-16); row 13 has 1's and 2,4's but expected 1's background and 2,4's at end—issues point to incorrect sorting (components placed out of row order), wrong lanes for eight-shapes (using 0/5 but shapes appear shifted left), and two-shapes fitting/clipping errors, plus possible frame misdetection (e.g., some 2-frames treated as eight?).
 * Overall, lane placement for eight-shapes works in non-overlap cases (as in train 1) but fails when overlap check triggers wrong lane or dx causes out-of-bounds without clip handling.
 * Two-shapes placement is broken: lane alternation (17 then 12) doesn't check prior placements, leading to consistent misalignments; fit check exists but fallback may not trigger properly, causing clipping in wrong spots.
 * Component filtering by frame=8/2 works (omits others correctly in train 1), but frame calculation via boundary Counter is mostly accurate yet sensitive to small boundaries.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the place_eight_shapes overlap check (only rows, no columns) is incomplete and leads to potential horizontal crowding; place_two_shapes lane_idx % len(lanes) is ad-hoc and doesn't adapt to grid specifics.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential extractor.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places eight-shapes (frame 8) in lanes around 0-5 (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's left-aligned, row 8-13 have 8's mid-left with 7's inside) and two-shapes in ~12-17 (e.g., row 0 has 2's at end, row 13 has 2,6's at ~5-9? misplaced left, row 16 has 2,3's at end but seems clipped), but background is 9 (correct, most common), yet placements mismatch expected patterns from trainings—e.g., row 3 has 8's then 9's but a 2-group intrudes early (col 12), suggesting two-shape placed too left without overlap avoidance; row 5 has 2,3's in col 12-17 but then 9's where internal colors should be preserved; row 9 has 8,8,7,7,7,8 mid but shifted wrong vs. likely vertical preservation; overall, it has similar issues to train 2/3 (misaligned two-shapes, possible clipping in row 5/16, no row-order preservation), so doesn't make sense as a correct rearrangement—likely fails due to same lane/fit bugs, and without expected, but by analogy, 3's and 6's are internal to two-shapes but placed with overlaps or wrong dx.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "components" (connected groups of non-background cells forming shapes or objects), identify their framing colors (e.g., 2 or 8 based on boundary cells), and rearrange them into a clean, standardized output grid layout that organizes them into lanes or sections while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with the background color. The rearrangement follows specific spatial rules, likely mimicking a sprite sheet or organized display, with components sorted and positioned to avoid overlaps and align properly across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (e.g., using stack/DFS) on non-background cells; each component tracks its bounding box (min/max row/col) and cells.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common internal color—this seems crucial for categorizing into types like "8-framed" or "2-framed" objects.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) for ordered placement; 8-framed components go into left-side "lanes" (e.g., columns 0-5 or similar), 2-framed into right-side lanes (e.g., columns 12-17 or 17+), with logic to handle vertical stacking and gaps (e.g., new row if below previous max_row +1).
 * Placement involves horizontal shifting (dx based on target lane minus original min_c) while keeping original rows; clip if out of bounds, but this can cause partial overlaps or truncations—subtle issue if shapes span multiple lanes.
 * Output starts as a full background grid, then overlays shifted components; preserve exact internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's, 6's inside shapes) but ensure no overlaps or distortions.
 * Subtleties: Shapes may have internal variations (e.g., a 3 inside a 2-frame), frames might not be uniform (hence boundary voting), and layout alternates lanes for 2-frames (e.g., [17,12] cycling). Gaps between sections (e.g., full background rows) must match input structure. Easy to miss: Some components might not be framed by 8/2 (ignore? or handle separately), vertical alignment must respect original row positions to keep multi-row shapes intact, and background varies (4 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 9 in test). Clipping during shift can lose parts of shapes. Sorting order affects which shape goes where—top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement. In ex3, top sections have misplaced 2's and 8's, suggesting lane logic fails when shapes are stacked closely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; useful across all examples.)

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)

```
(This is core and helpful: accurately detects connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for extraction in all examples, as shapes are preserved internally.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-bottom, left-to-right; essential for consistent placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled training example 1, extracting and placing all components accurately with proper lanes and no overlaps.
 * For training example 2 (bg=4), component extraction worked (shapes like 9's, 3's, 5's, 6's, 1's intact), but placement failed: 5-shaped and 3-shaped components in rows 2-5 were swapped/mispositioned (generated has 5's right of 3's in row 3, but expected has 5's left of 3's; row 5 has extra 4's invading 2-lane instead of clean 3's). Also, row 15 has 1's in wrong sub-position within 2-lane (generated columns 17-19 as 1's, expected 19-21). Row 16-17 show 1's and 6's shifted incorrectly, with 8's overlapping oddly. Gap rows (e.g., row 7,13) are correct as full bg.
 * For training example 3 (bg=1), extraction mostly worked (e.g., 2's,3's,5's,6's preserved), but placement severely off: Top rows 0-2 have 2's starting too early in columns 17-21 instead of later; rows 1-5 misplaced 8-frames with 2's inside shifted left. Rows 8-12 have 6's and 5's in wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 8 generated has 6's in 2-lane but expected empty). Bottom 8-frames in rows 14-19 are better but 4's and 3's swapped (generated 4's where expected 2's sub-shapes). Overall, lane alternation and gap logic (e.g., new lane after row gap) failed, causing overlaps and misalignments.
 * The lane logic for 8-comps (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5; dx shift) works partially for stacked left-side but fails when shapes span gaps or need wider lanes (e.g., ex3 top has 8's too narrow). For 2-comps, fixed alternating lanes [17,12] causes cycling issues (e.g., ex2 row15 1's in wrong lane; ex3 row0 2's in 17 but expected elsewhere).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program() placement (hardcoded lanes, simple dx shift without vertical adjustment or overlap checks) is broken for multi-section layouts—don't reuse as-is; extraction functions are solid and essential for identifying frame types and shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=9) does not look correct; while extraction seems okay (e.g., internal 3's,4's,6's,7's preserved in shapes), placement has similar issues as training 2/3: Rows 0-2 have 2's and 4's starting in column 17 but expected likely shifted right or alternated differently (e.g., row2 generated 2's in 12-16 overlapping 4's in 18-20, but expected may separate them cleanly). Rows 3-7 show 8-frames with 4's and 3's misplaced (generated 3's in column 13-15 but 4's invading row5 column 17+; expected probably swaps or spaces them like ex2's 5's/3's). Rows 8-13 have 8's with 7's internal okay, but 2's in row13 column5-9 seem out of place (expected in right lanes). Rows 14-21: 2-frames with 6's and 3's shifted wrong (e.g., row15 6's in 6-8 but expected centered in lane; row17 8-3's overlapping 2's). No full bg rows where gaps needed (e.g., between sections), leading to crowded layout—doesn't match organized sprite-sheet feel of expecteds, with shapes bleeding across lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python

    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom placement order.)

    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

```
(This reliably identifies background as most common value; essential and correct across attempts.)

                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc

                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:

                    'component': component,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent pixel colors, requiring the extraction of connected components (objects or blobs) excluding the background, identification of a "frame" color for each component based on boundary cells, and rearrangement of these components into fixed "lanes" (columns or positions) in a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to simulate assembling puzzle pieces into a standardized layout, likely for a game or matching challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to find connected non-background cells; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement.
 * Frame color is determined from the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use the most common color in the whole component.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain input order.
 * Placement rules: 8-framed components go into specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5, grouped by vertical adjacency into blocks and cycled across lanes); 2-framed into lanes like 12 or 17 based on original position; other frames may need different handling (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 not fully addressed).
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed column offsets; shift entire component horizontally by dx = target_lane - min_c, but only place if nc in bounds (0 to n-1); vertical position stays the same as original.
 * Grouping for 8s: Vertically adjacent components (min_r <= prev_max_r +1) form "blocks" placed alternately in lanes; non-adjacent start new blocks.
 * Easy to miss: Boundaries include out-of-grid adjacencies; components with no explicit boundary might default incorrectly; 1s seem to be background in some cases but not always; test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1).
 * All other non-8/2 components (e.g., framed with 3,4,5,6) are not placed in this attempt, leading to missing elements.
 * Preserve exact shapes: Overwrite output only where placing, no rotation/scaling.
 * n=22 in examples, but generalize to any n.
 * Potential overlap: Placement might overwrite if lanes conflict, but examples avoid it.

(This is essential: correctly extracts components, computes bounding boxes, and determines frame via boundary analysis; handles edge cases like no boundary; use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))

(Helpful for ordering components by position; preserves input layout order.)

    for r, c in comp['component']:

        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Core placement function; shifts horizontally while keeping rows fixed; bounds-check prevents overflow; reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for 8s (lanes 0/5, grouped blocks) and 2s (lanes 12/17 based on original min_c <=8 or >8) worked perfectly, including background fill with 1s.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., row 0 has [2,2,2,2,2,1,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,2,2]; rows 1-4 have 8s and 2s/3s shifted left with extra 2s in columns 0-4 where expected has 8s and 1s; row 6 has [8,6,6,6,8,1,...] but expected has [1,1,1,1,1,8,6,...] (6s shifted right into lane 6); rows 13-21 mostly match but top has anomalies; overall, 8-block grouping failed for upper components, treating them as separate and placing in wrong lanes, and 3-framed components (e.g., the 3s in expected rows 1-4 col 18-20) not placed at all (missing in generated).
 * 2-framed placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) worked in trains 1-2 but may overgeneralize; in train 3, it placed some 2s incorrectly in upper rows.
 * No handling for other frames (3,4,5,6): These are extracted but never placed, causing missing elements like the 3s,4s,5s,6s in expected train 3 (e.g., 3s in rows 15-17 cols 18-20, 4s in row 13 cols 18-20, 5s in rows 9-11 cols 13-15, 6s in rows 6-8 cols 6-8).
 * place_eights groups vertically adjacent 8-comps into blocks and cycles lanes 0/5, which succeeded in trains 1-2 but failed in train 3 by not grouping a upper block properly (placed small 8s/2s mix in cols 0-4 instead of full 8-frame in cols 0-4).
 * Background correctly 1 in trains, but placement overwrites incorrectly without preserving empty lanes fully.
 * No rotation or vertical shift; assumes original rows preserved, which matches expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It shows background 9 (plausible if most common), with 8-framed components placed in lanes 0/5 (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 has 8/4s, rows 8-12 cols 1-4 has 8/7s/1s, rows 16-20 cols 5-9 has 8/3s), 2-framed in lanes ~12-17 (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 12-16 has 2/4s, rows 13-17 cols 12-16 has 2/6s/3s), which aligns with rules; however, other frames like 1,3,4,6,7 are placed inconsistently or not at all (e.g., 7s in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 but expected likely needs them in a dedicated lane like 6-8; 1s scattered as if background but sometimes framed; 3s in row 16 col 13-15 and row 17 col 12-14 seem shifted wrong, possibly from unhandled 3-frame logic).
 * Missing elements: No clear placement for 5,6,7 frames (e.g., 6s in rows 14-16 cols 1-3 and row 16 col 12-14 look like partial 6-blobs, but expected probably groups them into lane 6 or similar); upper rows 0-2 have 2/4s in col 12-16 and 8/4s misplaced in row 3 col 0-4, suggesting 4-framed not handled (similar to train 3's missing 4s).
 * Overlaps or gaps: Rows 12-13 cols 0-4 empty-ish with 2s/8s bleeding; row 21 all 9s ok, but test likely expects fuller lanes for all frames (e.g., 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s in sequential lanes like 12,17,6, etc.); differences from expected unknown without input grid, but pattern mismatches train 3 errors (unplaced non-2/8 frames, bad grouping), so probably incorrect for similar reasons—e.g., 4s in row 0 col 13-15 and row 3 col 1-3 should be in a right-side lane, not split.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:15:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where connected components (blobs of non-background cells) are identified, classified by a "frame" color (most common color on their boundary adjacent to background or grid edges), and rearranged into a standardized output grid. Components framed in 8 are placed in two left-side lanes (columns 0 and 5) with vertical non-overlap and alternating placement, while components framed in 2 are placed in right-side lanes (around columns 12 or 17) based on their original horizontal position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components must be extracted fully, including their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for positioning.
 * Frame determination: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common color among boundary cells. If no boundary (rare, internal component), use most common color in the whole component. This is crucial for classifying as 8-framed or 2-framed.
 * Placement rules: Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c). For 8-framed: Use two lanes (cols 0 and 5); place in a lane without vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; alternate lanes per "group" separated by row gaps; if no fit, force into lane 0. For 2-framed: Place left-leaning (min_c <=8) in col 12 lane, right-leaning in col 17 lane, shifting horizontally to align min_c.
 * Subtleties: Components may touch edges, so boundaries include out-of-bounds checks. Overlap avoidance is only vertical per lane (not horizontal across lanes). Gaps in rows (max_r +1 < next min_r) reset lane alternation. Output initializes to background; placements overwrite without merging or rotation. Colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7 are inner fills, not frames. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions per cell; components can be irregular shapes (e.g., L-shapes or with holes? but code assumes no holes in connectivity).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within component. Grid size n=22 fixed? (from outputs). Ensure placements stay within bounds (code checks nc < n).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background, e.g., 1 in example 3.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:

                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:

                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: Extracts components with bounding boxes and frames correctly; uses DFS for connectivity and boundary detection.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering placements by original top-left position.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for shifting and placing without rotation; bounds-checked.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identified background (1 in example 3), extracted components, computed frames (8 and 2), and separated/sorted them, which worked for training 1 and 2.
 * Placement logic for 8-framed components in lanes 0/5 with vertical overlap avoidance and alternation worked for training 1/2 but failed in 3: Generated misplaced a 3-filled component (originally right-side) into left lanes, and top rows had incorrect 2/3 placements (e.g., row 1 generated [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected all 1's except right; row 2 had 8,2,2,2,8 but shifted wrong).
 * For 2-framed: Placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8, but in example 3, this put a left-leaning 3-component (frame 2?) too far left, overlapping or misaligning with expected right-side 3's in cols 18-20.
 * Boundary/frame detection worked (e.g., 8-frames for boxes around 2/3/4/5/6 fills), but subtle issue: Some components' boundaries might include inner colors if not purely edged, leading to wrong frame (unknown if this caused example 3 failure).
 * Lane alternation reset on row gaps is good but in example 3, global_max_r tracking may have failed to group properly, causing overflow to lane 0 prematurely.
 * No merging of components; assumes disjoint, which held.
 * Overall, core extraction and simple placements succeeded in 2/3 cases, but complex interleaving/overlap in denser grids (example 3) broke.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (common), with 8-framed components (e.g., boxes around 4's,7's,3's,6's) placed in left lanes 0/5-ish, but some shifts are off (e.g., row 3 has 8,4,4,4,8 starting col 0, good; but row 15 has 2,6,6,6,2 in col 0 lane, which should be 8-framed if boxed). 2-framed placements on right (e.g., 4's in cols 13-15, 3's in 14-16) seem aligned to 12/17, but row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col 12 with trailing 2's extending to col 21, which matches no-overwrite but may clip or misalign if original min_c >8. Top rows have 2's misplaced (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but expected might have cleaner 9's). Inner fills (1,3,4,5,6,7) preserved, but a 1-component in rows 8-11 cols 6-8 seems unplaced or merged wrong (appears in lane 5?). Overall, it partially matches rules (lanes used, no overlaps), but likely wrong frames or sorting caused extra 2's on left and missing some 8-boxes on right; doesn't fully make sense without input grid, but differences suggest placement order bug for mixed frames.

[2025-10-01 20:15:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []

                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))

                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])

    if not placed:

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the filler color, e.g., 1 or 9 in examples; essential first step.)

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent pixel colors, requiring the extraction of connected components (objects or blobs) excluding the background, identification of a "frame" color for each component based on boundary cells, and rearrangement of these components into fixed "lanes" (columns or positions) in a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to simulate assembling puzzle pieces into a standardized layout, likely for a game or matching challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to find connected non-background cells; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement.
 * Frame color is determined from the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use the most common color in the whole component.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain input order.
 * Placement rules: 8-framed components go into specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5, grouped by vertical adjacency into blocks and cycled across lanes); 2-framed into lanes like 12 or 17 based on original position; other frames may need different handling (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 not fully addressed).
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed column offsets; shift entire component horizontally by dx = target_lane - min_c, but only place if nc in bounds (0 to n-1); vertical position stays the same as original.
 * Grouping for 8s: Vertically adjacent components (min_r <= prev_max_r +1) form "blocks" placed alternately in lanes; non-adjacent start new blocks.
 * Easy to miss: Boundaries include out-of-grid adjacencies; components with no explicit boundary might default incorrectly; 1s seem to be background in some cases but not always; test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1).
 * All other non-8/2 components (e.g., framed with 3,4,5,6) are not placed in this attempt, leading to missing elements.
 * Preserve exact shapes: Overwrite output only where placing, no rotation/scaling.
 * n=22 in examples, but generalize to any n.
 * Potential overlap: Placement might overwrite if lanes conflict, but examples avoid it.

        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Core placement function; shifts horizontally while keeping rows fixed; bounds-check prevents overflow; reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for 8s (lanes 0/5, grouped blocks) and 2s (lanes 12/17 based on original min_c <=8 or >8) worked perfectly, including background fill with 1s.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., row 0 has [2,2,2,2,2,1,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,2,2]; rows 1-4 have 8s and 2s/3s shifted left with extra 2s in columns 0-4 where expected has 8s and 1s; row 6 has [8,6,6,6,8,1,...] but expected has [1,1,1,1,1,8,6,...] (6s shifted right into lane 6); rows 13-21 mostly match but top has anomalies; overall, 8-block grouping failed for upper components, treating them as separate and placing in wrong lanes, and 3-framed components (e.g., the 3s in expected rows 1-4 col 18-20) not placed at all (missing in generated).
 * 2-framed placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) worked in trains 1-2 but may overgeneralize; in train 3, it placed some 2s incorrectly in upper rows.
 * No handling for other frames (3,4,5,6): These are extracted but never placed, causing missing elements like the 3s,4s,5s,6s in expected train 3 (e.g., 3s in rows 15-17 cols 18-20, 4s in row 13 cols 18-20, 5s in rows 9-11 cols 13-15, 6s in rows 6-8 cols 6-8).
 * place_eights groups vertically adjacent 8-comps into blocks and cycles lanes 0/5, which succeeded in trains 1-2 but failed in train 3 by not grouping a upper block properly (placed small 8s/2s mix in cols 0-4 instead of full 8-frame in cols 0-4).
 * Background correctly 1 in trains, but placement overwrites incorrectly without preserving empty lanes fully.
 * No rotation or vertical shift; assumes original rows preserved, which matches expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It shows background 9 (plausible if most common), with 8-framed components placed in lanes 0/5 (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 has 8/4s, rows 8-12 cols 1-4 has 8/7s/1s, rows 16-20 cols 5-9 has 8/3s), 2-framed in lanes ~12-17 (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 12-16 has 2/4s, rows 13-17 cols 12-16 has 2/6s/3s), which aligns with rules; however, other frames like 1,3,4,6,7 are placed inconsistently or not at all (e.g., 7s in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 but expected likely needs them in a dedicated lane like 6-8; 1s scattered as if background but sometimes framed; 3s in row 16 col 13-15 and row 17 col 12-14 seem shifted wrong, possibly from unhandled 3-frame logic).
 * Missing elements: No clear placement for 5,6,7 frames (e.g., 6s in rows 14-16 cols 1-3 and row 16 col 12-14 look like partial 6-blobs, but expected probably groups them into lane 6 or similar); upper rows 0-2 have 2/4s in col 12-16 and 8/4s misplaced in row 3 col 0-4, suggesting 4-framed not handled (similar to train 3's missing 4s).
 * Overlaps or gaps: Rows 12-13 cols 0-4 empty-ish with 2s/8s bleeding; row 21 all 9s ok, but test likely expects fuller lanes for all frames (e.g., 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s in sequential lanes like 12,17,6, etc.); differences from expected unknown without input grid, but pattern mismatches train 3 errors (unplaced non-2/8 frames, bad grouping), so probably incorrect for similar reasons—e.g., 4s in row 0 col 13-15 and row 3 col 1-3 should be in a right-side lane, not split.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where connected components (blobs of non-background cells) are identified, classified by a "frame" color (most common color on their boundary adjacent to background or grid edges), and rearranged into a standardized output grid. Components framed in 8 are placed in two left-side lanes (columns 0 and 5) with vertical non-overlap and alternating placement, while components framed in 2 are placed in right-side lanes (around columns 12 or 17) based on their original horizontal position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components must be extracted fully, including their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for positioning.
 * Frame determination: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common color among boundary cells. If no boundary (rare, internal component), use most common color in the whole component. This is crucial for classifying as 8-framed or 2-framed.
 * Placement rules: Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c). For 8-framed: Use two lanes (cols 0 and 5); place in a lane without vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; alternate lanes per "group" separated by row gaps; if no fit, force into lane 0. For 2-framed: Place left-leaning (min_c <=8) in col 12 lane, right-leaning in col 17 lane, shifting horizontally to align min_c.
 * Subtleties: Components may touch edges, so boundaries include out-of-bounds checks. Overlap avoidance is only vertical per lane (not horizontal across lanes). Gaps in rows (max_r +1 < next min_r) reset lane alternation. Output initializes to background; placements overwrite without merging or rotation. Colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7 are inner fills, not frames. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions per cell; components can be irregular shapes (e.g., L-shapes or with holes? but code assumes no holes in connectivity).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within component. Grid size n=22 fixed? (from outputs). Ensure placements stay within bounds (code checks nc < n).

                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: Extracts components with bounding boxes and frames correctly; uses DFS for connectivity and boundary detection.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering placements by original top-left position.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for shifting and placing without rotation; bounds-checked.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identified background (1 in example 3), extracted components, computed frames (8 and 2), and separated/sorted them, which worked for training 1 and 2.
 * Placement logic for 8-framed components in lanes 0/5 with vertical overlap avoidance and alternation worked for training 1/2 but failed in 3: Generated misplaced a 3-filled component (originally right-side) into left lanes, and top rows had incorrect 2/3 placements (e.g., row 1 generated [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected all 1's except right; row 2 had 8,2,2,2,8 but shifted wrong).
 * For 2-framed: Placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8, but in example 3, this put a left-leaning 3-component (frame 2?) too far left, overlapping or misaligning with expected right-side 3's in cols 18-20.
 * Boundary/frame detection worked (e.g., 8-frames for boxes around 2/3/4/5/6 fills), but subtle issue: Some components' boundaries might include inner colors if not purely edged, leading to wrong frame (unknown if this caused example 3 failure).
 * Lane alternation reset on row gaps is good but in example 3, global_max_r tracking may have failed to group properly, causing overflow to lane 0 prematurely.
 * No merging of components; assumes disjoint, which held.
 * Overall, core extraction and simple placements succeeded in 2/3 cases, but complex interleaving/overlap in denser grids (example 3) broke.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (common), with 8-framed components (e.g., boxes around 4's,7's,3's,6's) placed in left lanes 0/5-ish, but some shifts are off (e.g., row 3 has 8,4,4,4,8 starting col 0, good; but row 15 has 2,6,6,6,2 in col 0 lane, which should be 8-framed if boxed). 2-framed placements on right (e.g., 4's in cols 13-15, 3's in 14-16) seem aligned to 12/17, but row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col 12 with trailing 2's extending to col 21, which matches no-overwrite but may clip or misalign if original min_c >8. Top rows have 2's misplaced (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but expected might have cleaner 9's). Inner fills (1,3,4,5,6,7) preserved, but a 1-component in rows 8-11 cols 6-8 seems unplaced or merged wrong (appears in lane 5?). Overall, it partially matches rules (lanes used, no overlaps), but likely wrong frames or sorting caused extra 2's on left and missing some 8-boxes on right; doesn't fully make sense without input grid, but differences suggest placement order bug for mixed frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:18:48] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify the background color, extract connected components (blobs of non-background cells), determine a "frame" color for each component based on its boundary cells, and then rearrange these components into fixed "lanes" on a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to standardize the layout, likely simulating a puzzle where objects are sorted or organized by frame type (e.g., 8 or 2) into specific columns, handling overlaps by alternating lanes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form components via 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Components must track bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for overlap detection and placement; sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent order.
 * Frame color is the most common value on the component's boundary (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary exists (rare, fully enclosed), fall back to most common value in the component— this subtlety handles isolated or inner blobs.
 * Placement rules: For frame=8 components, use lanes at columns 0 and 5, alternating based on index and checking row-overlaps in occupied lanes; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, fallback to 0. For frame=2, place in lane 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17— this assumes binary left/right positioning but may fail if components span mid-grid.
 * Overlap check only considers row ranges (min_r to max_r), ignoring columns, which can cause vertical stacking issues if components have varying heights.
 * Output must exactly replicate component shapes by shifting horizontally (dx = target_lane - original_min_c) without rotation, scaling, or modification; cells outside bounds are ignored, but no vertical shifting occurs.
 * Subtle edge case: Components touching the grid edge count as boundary; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing. In examples, numbers like 1-9 represent colors/patterns, with 4/1/9 often as backgrounds.
 * Potential miss: Not all components are placed (code filters only frame=8 and 2, ignoring others like frame=3 or 6); this works for train1 but fails train2/3 where other frames (e.g., 3-blobs) need handling or are inner to frames.
 * Grid size is fixed at n x something (22 in examples? but code assumes square nxn); outputs are flattened rows but represent 2D.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 correct: Successfully identified background=4, extracted components, framed correctly (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frames in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frames in 12/17 based on position, matching expected layout exactly.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated places some 8-frame components (e.g., the 8-3-3-3 blob in rows 9-12) shifted right to start at column 5 instead of 0, resulting in leading 4's where expected 8's; inner 3-blobs preserved but position wrong; upper 8-9-9-9 and 2-5-5-5 correct, but lower 8-3 and 8-1-6 mismatched lanes; 2-6-6-6 placed in lane 12 correctly but overall layout offset.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated misplaces top-left components, e.g., places a 2-3-3-3 blob at columns 0-4 in rows 1-4 where expected 1-background and 8-2-2-2 in columns 0-4; 8-6-6-6 placed correctly in row7-8 but shifted; 2-5-5-5 in lane12 correct, but entire top section has 2-blobs where 1's expected, and lower 8-3-3-3 in correct position but preceded by wrong 2-placement; suggests failure to filter non-8/2 frames or wrong lane assignment for left-side blobs.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames works in train1 (no conflicts) but fails in train2/3 by not alternating properly or ignoring non-8 components (e.g., bare 3 or 6 blobs get framed wrong or skipped).
 * Component extraction via DFS/stack is solid and helpful, correctly finds connected groups and boundaries; Counter for frame is key but assumes boundary always exists (fallback rare).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures order but may not match puzzle's intended "reading order" if components overlap in rows.
 * Lane hardcoding (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) works for train1 but brittle—train2/3 show need for dynamic lanes or handling more frame types (e.g., place all in sequence?).
 * No vertical adjustment; assumes original rows preserved, which matches examples but could fail if components need stacking.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct (used in all), but boundary detection misses if component has no edge-touch (though examples do); unhelpful if we add diagonal connectivity (but 4-way is right).
 * The main program ties it together but is broken for multi-frame or overlap-heavy cases; place_component is helpful but ignores out-of-bounds (clips, which happened in test?).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct and shows similar issues to train2/3: Background seems 9 (most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-4-4-4, 2-4-4-4, 8-1-1-1 with inner 7? wait, 7 not in input?), but placements are off—e.g., upper 8-4-4-4 starts at col0 row3 correctly? but row8 has 9-8-8-8-8-8-1-1-1-8-9... suggesting 8-frame with inner1 placed at col1-9? mismatched; lower 2-6-6-6 at col0-4 row14-17 but then 8-3-3-3 at col5-9 row16-18, indicating overlap failure like train2 (shifted right instead of alternating lanes).
 * Missing or wrong: No clear handling for inner components (e.g., 7 in row9-10 col2-4, but input likely has no 7—possible extraction error); 2-3-3-3 in row17-20 col5-9 but expected probably lane0/5; overall, looks like 8-frames crammed into lanes 0/5 but with clipping or wrong dx (e.g., row3 [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] good, but row8 shifted left with leading9's where frame should start at0).
 * Does not make sense fully: Inner values preserved (e.g., 4 in 8-frame, 3 in 2-frame), but positions suggest the lane alternation/overlap check is buggy (e.g., multiple 8's overlapping rows, not switching lanes properly); compared to train2, it's a repeat of the shift error, so likely incorrect without expected, but patterns don't align to a clean standardized layout (e.g., lanes not purely occupied without bleed).

[2025-10-01 20:18:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify the background color, extract connected components (blobs of non-background cells), determine a "frame" color for each component based on its boundary cells, and then rearrange these components into fixed "lanes" on a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to standardize the layout, likely simulating a puzzle where objects are sorted or organized by frame type (e.g., 8 or 2) into specific columns, handling overlaps by alternating lanes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form components via 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Components must track bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for overlap detection and placement; sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent order.
 * Frame color is the most common value on the component's boundary (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary exists (rare, fully enclosed), fall back to most common value in the component— this subtlety handles isolated or inner blobs.
 * Placement rules: For frame=8 components, use lanes at columns 0 and 5, alternating based on index and checking row-overlaps in occupied lanes; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, fallback to 0. For frame=2, place in lane 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17— this assumes binary left/right positioning but may fail if components span mid-grid.
 * Overlap check only considers row ranges (min_r to max_r), ignoring columns, which can cause vertical stacking issues if components have varying heights.
 * Output must exactly replicate component shapes by shifting horizontally (dx = target_lane - original_min_c) without rotation, scaling, or modification; cells outside bounds are ignored, but no vertical shifting occurs.
 * Subtle edge case: Components touching the grid edge count as boundary; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing. In examples, numbers like 1-9 represent colors/patterns, with 4/1/9 often as backgrounds.
 * Potential miss: Not all components are placed (code filters only frame=8 and 2, ignoring others like frame=3 or 6); this works for train1 but fails train2/3 where other frames (e.g., 3-blobs) need handling or are inner to frames.
 * Grid size is fixed at n x something (22 in examples? but code assumes square nxn); outputs are flattened rows but represent 2D.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()

        for j in range(n):

(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential and correct.)

```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])

    if not placed:

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the filler color, e.g., 1 or 9 in examples; essential first step.)

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent pixel colors, requiring the extraction of connected components (objects or blobs) excluding the background, identification of a "frame" color for each component based on boundary cells, and rearrangement of these components into fixed "lanes" (columns or positions) in a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to simulate assembling puzzle pieces into a standardized layout, likely for a game or matching challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to find connected non-background cells; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement.
 * Frame color is determined from the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use the most common color in the whole component.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain input order.
 * Placement rules: 8-framed components go into specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5, grouped by vertical adjacency into blocks and cycled across lanes); 2-framed into lanes like 12 or 17 based on original position; other frames may need different handling (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 not fully addressed).
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed column offsets; shift entire component horizontally by dx = target_lane - min_c, but only place if nc in bounds (0 to n-1); vertical position stays the same as original.
 * Grouping for 8s: Vertically adjacent components (min_r <= prev_max_r +1) form "blocks" placed alternately in lanes; non-adjacent start new blocks.
 * Easy to miss: Boundaries include out-of-grid adjacencies; components with no explicit boundary might default incorrectly; 1s seem to be background in some cases but not always; test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1).
 * All other non-8/2 components (e.g., framed with 3,4,5,6) are not placed in this attempt, leading to missing elements.
 * Preserve exact shapes: Overwrite output only where placing, no rotation/scaling.
 * n=22 in examples, but generalize to any n.
 * Potential overlap: Placement might overwrite if lanes conflict, but examples avoid it.

        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Core placement function; shifts horizontally while keeping rows fixed; bounds-check prevents overflow; reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for 8s (lanes 0/5, grouped blocks) and 2s (lanes 12/17 based on original min_c <=8 or >8) worked perfectly, including background fill with 1s.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., row 0 has [2,2,2,2,2,1,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,2,2]; rows 1-4 have 8s and 2s/3s shifted left with extra 2s in columns 0-4 where expected has 8s and 1s; row 6 has [8,6,6,6,8,1,...] but expected has [1,1,1,1,1,8,6,...] (6s shifted right into lane 6); rows 13-21 mostly match but top has anomalies; overall, 8-block grouping failed for upper components, treating them as separate and placing in wrong lanes, and 3-framed components (e.g., the 3s in expected rows 1-4 col 18-20) not placed at all (missing in generated).
 * 2-framed placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) worked in trains 1-2 but may overgeneralize; in train 3, it placed some 2s incorrectly in upper rows.
 * No handling for other frames (3,4,5,6): These are extracted but never placed, causing missing elements like the 3s,4s,5s,6s in expected train 3 (e.g., 3s in rows 15-17 cols 18-20, 4s in row 13 cols 18-20, 5s in rows 9-11 cols 13-15, 6s in rows 6-8 cols 6-8).
 * place_eights groups vertically adjacent 8-comps into blocks and cycles lanes 0/5, which succeeded in trains 1-2 but failed in train 3 by not grouping a upper block properly (placed small 8s/2s mix in cols 0-4 instead of full 8-frame in cols 0-4).
 * Background correctly 1 in trains, but placement overwrites incorrectly without preserving empty lanes fully.
 * No rotation or vertical shift; assumes original rows preserved, which matches expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It shows background 9 (plausible if most common), with 8-framed components placed in lanes 0/5 (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 has 8/4s, rows 8-12 cols 1-4 has 8/7s/1s, rows 16-20 cols 5-9 has 8/3s), 2-framed in lanes ~12-17 (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 12-16 has 2/4s, rows 13-17 cols 12-16 has 2/6s/3s), which aligns with rules; however, other frames like 1,3,4,6,7 are placed inconsistently or not at all (e.g., 7s in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 but expected likely needs them in a dedicated lane like 6-8; 1s scattered as if background but sometimes framed; 3s in row 16 col 13-15 and row 17 col 12-14 seem shifted wrong, possibly from unhandled 3-frame logic).
 * Missing elements: No clear placement for 5,6,7 frames (e.g., 6s in rows 14-16 cols 1-3 and row 16 col 12-14 look like partial 6-blobs, but expected probably groups them into lane 6 or similar); upper rows 0-2 have 2/4s in col 12-16 and 8/4s misplaced in row 3 col 0-4, suggesting 4-framed not handled (similar to train 3's missing 4s).
 * Overlaps or gaps: Rows 12-13 cols 0-4 empty-ish with 2s/8s bleeding; row 21 all 9s ok, but test likely expects fuller lanes for all frames (e.g., 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s in sequential lanes like 12,17,6, etc.); differences from expected unknown without input grid, but pattern mismatches train 3 errors (unplaced non-2/8 frames, bad grouping), so probably incorrect for similar reasons—e.g., 4s in row 0 col 13-15 and row 3 col 1-3 should be in a right-side lane, not split.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where connected components (blobs of non-background cells) are identified, classified by a "frame" color (most common color on their boundary adjacent to background or grid edges), and rearranged into a standardized output grid. Components framed in 8 are placed in two left-side lanes (columns 0 and 5) with vertical non-overlap and alternating placement, while components framed in 2 are placed in right-side lanes (around columns 12 or 17) based on their original horizontal position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components must be extracted fully, including their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for positioning.
 * Frame determination: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common color among boundary cells. If no boundary (rare, internal component), use most common color in the whole component. This is crucial for classifying as 8-framed or 2-framed.
 * Placement rules: Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c). For 8-framed: Use two lanes (cols 0 and 5); place in a lane without vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; alternate lanes per "group" separated by row gaps; if no fit, force into lane 0. For 2-framed: Place left-leaning (min_c <=8) in col 12 lane, right-leaning in col 17 lane, shifting horizontally to align min_c.
 * Subtleties: Components may touch edges, so boundaries include out-of-bounds checks. Overlap avoidance is only vertical per lane (not horizontal across lanes). Gaps in rows (max_r +1 < next min_r) reset lane alternation. Output initializes to background; placements overwrite without merging or rotation. Colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7 are inner fills, not frames. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions per cell; components can be irregular shapes (e.g., L-shapes or with holes? but code assumes no holes in connectivity).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within component. Grid size n=22 fixed? (from outputs). Ensure placements stay within bounds (code checks nc < n).

                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: Extracts components with bounding boxes and frames correctly; uses DFS for connectivity and boundary detection.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering placements by original top-left position.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for shifting and placing without rotation; bounds-checked.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identified background (1 in example 3), extracted components, computed frames (8 and 2), and separated/sorted them, which worked for training 1 and 2.
 * Placement logic for 8-framed components in lanes 0/5 with vertical overlap avoidance and alternation worked for training 1/2 but failed in 3: Generated misplaced a 3-filled component (originally right-side) into left lanes, and top rows had incorrect 2/3 placements (e.g., row 1 generated [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected all 1's except right; row 2 had 8,2,2,2,8 but shifted wrong).
 * For 2-framed: Placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8, but in example 3, this put a left-leaning 3-component (frame 2?) too far left, overlapping or misaligning with expected right-side 3's in cols 18-20.
 * Boundary/frame detection worked (e.g., 8-frames for boxes around 2/3/4/5/6 fills), but subtle issue: Some components' boundaries might include inner colors if not purely edged, leading to wrong frame (unknown if this caused example 3 failure).
 * Lane alternation reset on row gaps is good but in example 3, global_max_r tracking may have failed to group properly, causing overflow to lane 0 prematurely.
 * No merging of components; assumes disjoint, which held.
 * Overall, core extraction and simple placements succeeded in 2/3 cases, but complex interleaving/overlap in denser grids (example 3) broke.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (common), with 8-framed components (e.g., boxes around 4's,7's,3's,6's) placed in left lanes 0/5-ish, but some shifts are off (e.g., row 3 has 8,4,4,4,8 starting col 0, good; but row 15 has 2,6,6,6,2 in col 0 lane, which should be 8-framed if boxed). 2-framed placements on right (e.g., 4's in cols 13-15, 3's in 14-16) seem aligned to 12/17, but row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col 12 with trailing 2's extending to col 21, which matches no-overwrite but may clip or misalign if original min_c >8. Top rows have 2's misplaced (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but expected might have cleaner 9's). Inner fills (1,3,4,5,6,7) preserved, but a 1-component in rows 8-11 cols 6-8 seems unplaced or merged wrong (appears in lane 5?). Overall, it partially matches rules (lanes used, no overlaps), but likely wrong frames or sorting caused extra 2's on left and missing some 8-boxes on right; doesn't fully make sense without input grid, but differences suggest placement order bug for mixed frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:24:05] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the goal is to identify connected "components" (non-background blobs or objects), classify them by a "frame" value (e.g., based on boundary colors), and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into specific horizontal "lanes" while preserving their internal structure and avoiding overlaps. The output grid maintains the same size and background value, effectively sorting and positioning objects like in a puzzle assembly or inventory layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs, ignoring isolated pixels or background.
 * Components are classified by "frame": the most common value on the boundary pixels (those touching background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully enclosed, rare), use the most common internal value. Frames like 8 or 2 seem to denote object types (e.g., 8 for framed boxes, 2 for simpler shapes).
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to process in reading order.
 * Placement uses fixed lanes: for frame=8 components, lanes at columns 0 and 5 with overlap avoidance based on row ranges (min_r to max_r); alternate lanes per "group" of vertically stacked components, resetting lane choice if a gap in rows (>1). For frame=2, lanes at 12 (leftish) or 17 (rightish) based on original min_c (<=8 or >8).
 * Subtleties: Boundary detection must strictly check adjacency to background/edge; enclosed components fallback to internal mode. Overlap check for lanes considers vertical row spans only (ignores horizontal, assuming fixed lane width fits). Components may shift horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) but rows stay fixed (no vertical shifting). Preserve exact pixel values when placing.
 * Potential misses: Assumes only frames 2 and 8; other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) in grids are internals, not frames—may need handling if they appear as frames. Lanes are hardcoded and may not scale; test grids have n=22, but logic assumes this. No rotation or scaling of components. Gaps between components (e.g., row skips) trigger lane reset for stacking. Background fills unoccupied cells.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components touching multiple frames or irregular shapes; boundary counter only on perimeter, not full component. If no boundary pixels, fallback may misclassify. Placement can clip if dx pushes outside bounds (code checks 0<=nc<n but still places if yes—potential partial clip). Sorting is stable by position, but ties may affect order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common value; essential and correct.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary/frame detection is core and helpful; captures bounding boxes and preserves structure accurately. Use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but effective for processing order; helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified background (1), extracted components, classified frames (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frame in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frame in 12/17, resulting in exact match.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated top rows (0-4) misplaced a 2/3 shape on left (e.g., row0 all 2's then 1's; row1-4 has 3's framed by 2's on left, 8's with 2's on right), while expected has 1's background on top row, then right-side 8-frame with internal 2's and 3's starting row1. Also, 6-shape in rows7-9 generated with 8-frame on left but expected shifted right (under 1's in cols0-4, 8-frame cols5-9); unknown why lanes misassigned or order wrong—possibly frame misclassification for top components (3's boundary as 2 vs expected 8?) or sorting/placement not respecting vertical groups.
 * place_component and place_two_components are helpful but hardcoded lanes (12/17) worked for trains 1-2; in train3, two_comps placement correct for bottom but top misplacement suggests eight_comps logic failed (e.g., overlaps not detected, lane alternation wrong).
 * place_eight_components is partially helpful (overlap avoidance via row spans) but buggy: In train3, it stacked 6's too high/early (row6-9 vs expected row6-8 under 1's), and top 8/2/3 not isolated to right lane; global_max_r reset logic may fail on multi-group stacks, forcing default lane0. Doesn't handle left-shifted 1's prefix in expected rows6-8/10-12.
 * Overall, component extraction works (blobs intact), but classification/placement fails when components have irregular frames (e.g., 3-internal as non-8) or vertical spacing triggers wrong lane choice.
 * No unhelpful functions; all build toward solution, but lane hardcoding limits generality (e.g., test has bg=9, different lanes?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct or consistent with puzzle rules; it has irregular placements (e.g., top rows0-3 mix 9-bg, 2/4 on right col12-17, but 8/4 frame on left col0-4 row3-7 overlaps vertically without clear lane separation; row3 has 8's on left then 2/4 on right, but internals like 3's in row5-6 col17-20 shifted oddly).
 * Missing expected structure: Expected likely mirrors train3 pattern—background 9 fills most, with 8-frames in lanes ~0/5 for boxed shapes (e.g., 4's,6's,7's,3's internals), 2-frames in ~12/17; but generated places 2/4 early on right (rows0-2 col12-17), then 8/4 left (rows3-7 col0-4), 8/7 mid-left (rows8-11 col1-4? with 1's internal?), 2/6 mid (rows14-17 col0-4 and col12-16?), bottom 8/3 right-misplaced. This suggests overlap or lane mischoice (e.g., 8-comps not alternating properly, treating spaced groups as one).
 * Does not make sense: Clipping or out-of-bounds? No, but e.g., row12 all 8's/9's but no internals; bottom row18-21 has 8/3 in col5-9 but expected probably stacked cleaner. Differs from train3 failure (misplaced top) by having more left-right mixing; likely same root cause (frame=8 over/under-placement). To fix, refine lane alternation for gaps and classify non-8/2 frames (e.g., if boundary=2 but internal=3, still place as 2-lane?).

[2025-10-01 20:24:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify the background color, extract connected components (blobs of non-background cells), determine a "frame" color for each component based on its boundary cells, and then rearrange these components into fixed "lanes" on a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to standardize the layout, likely simulating a puzzle where objects are sorted or organized by frame type (e.g., 8 or 2) into specific columns, handling overlaps by alternating lanes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form components via 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Components must track bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for overlap detection and placement; sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent order.
 * Frame color is the most common value on the component's boundary (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary exists (rare, fully enclosed), fall back to most common value in the component— this subtlety handles isolated or inner blobs.
 * Placement rules: For frame=8 components, use lanes at columns 0 and 5, alternating based on index and checking row-overlaps in occupied lanes; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, fallback to 0. For frame=2, place in lane 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17— this assumes binary left/right positioning but may fail if components span mid-grid.
 * Overlap check only considers row ranges (min_r to max_r), ignoring columns, which can cause vertical stacking issues if components have varying heights.
 * Output must exactly replicate component shapes by shifting horizontally (dx = target_lane - original_min_c) without rotation, scaling, or modification; cells outside bounds are ignored, but no vertical shifting occurs.
 * Subtle edge case: Components touching the grid edge count as boundary; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing. In examples, numbers like 1-9 represent colors/patterns, with 4/1/9 often as backgrounds.
 * Potential miss: Not all components are placed (code filters only frame=8 and 2, ignoring others like frame=3 or 6); this works for train1 but fails train2/3 where other frames (e.g., 3-blobs) need handling or are inner to frames.
 * Grid size is fixed at n x something (22 in examples? but code assumes square nxn); outputs are flattened rows but represent 2D.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 correct: Successfully identified background=4, extracted components, framed correctly (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frames in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frames in 12/17 based on position, matching expected layout exactly.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated places some 8-frame components (e.g., the 8-3-3-3 blob in rows 9-12) shifted right to start at column 5 instead of 0, resulting in leading 4's where expected 8's; inner 3-blobs preserved but position wrong; upper 8-9-9-9 and 2-5-5-5 correct, but lower 8-3 and 8-1-6 mismatched lanes; 2-6-6-6 placed in lane 12 correctly but overall layout offset.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated misplaces top-left components, e.g., places a 2-3-3-3 blob at columns 0-4 in rows 1-4 where expected 1-background and 8-2-2-2 in columns 0-4; 8-6-6-6 placed correctly in row7-8 but shifted; 2-5-5-5 in lane12 correct, but entire top section has 2-blobs where 1's expected, and lower 8-3-3-3 in correct position but preceded by wrong 2-placement; suggests failure to filter non-8/2 frames or wrong lane assignment for left-side blobs.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames works in train1 (no conflicts) but fails in train2/3 by not alternating properly or ignoring non-8 components (e.g., bare 3 or 6 blobs get framed wrong or skipped).
 * Component extraction via DFS/stack is solid and helpful, correctly finds connected groups and boundaries; Counter for frame is key but assumes boundary always exists (fallback rare).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures order but may not match puzzle's intended "reading order" if components overlap in rows.
 * Lane hardcoding (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) works for train1 but brittle—train2/3 show need for dynamic lanes or handling more frame types (e.g., place all in sequence?).
 * No vertical adjustment; assumes original rows preserved, which matches examples but could fail if components need stacking.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct (used in all), but boundary detection misses if component has no edge-touch (though examples do); unhelpful if we add diagonal connectivity (but 4-way is right).
 * The main program ties it together but is broken for multi-frame or overlap-heavy cases; place_component is helpful but ignores out-of-bounds (clips, which happened in test?).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct and shows similar issues to train2/3: Background seems 9 (most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-4-4-4, 2-4-4-4, 8-1-1-1 with inner 7? wait, 7 not in input?), but placements are off—e.g., upper 8-4-4-4 starts at col0 row3 correctly? but row8 has 9-8-8-8-8-8-1-1-1-8-9... suggesting 8-frame with inner1 placed at col1-9? mismatched; lower 2-6-6-6 at col0-4 row14-17 but then 8-3-3-3 at col5-9 row16-18, indicating overlap failure like train2 (shifted right instead of alternating lanes).
 * Missing or wrong: No clear handling for inner components (e.g., 7 in row9-10 col2-4, but input likely has no 7—possible extraction error); 2-3-3-3 in row17-20 col5-9 but expected probably lane0/5; overall, looks like 8-frames crammed into lanes 0/5 but with clipping or wrong dx (e.g., row3 [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] good, but row8 shifted left with leading9's where frame should start at0).
 * Does not make sense fully: Inner values preserved (e.g., 4 in 8-frame, 3 in 2-frame), but positions suggest the lane alternation/overlap check is buggy (e.g., multiple 8's overlapping rows, not switching lanes properly); compared to train2, it's a repeat of the shift error, so likely incorrect without expected, but patterns don't align to a clean standardized layout (e.g., lanes not purely occupied without bleed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int):
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        # Fallback to first lane
        lane = lanes8[0]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

```python

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))

(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

```

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent pixel colors, requiring the extraction of connected components (objects or blobs) excluding the background, identification of a "frame" color for each component based on boundary cells, and rearrangement of these components into fixed "lanes" (columns or positions) in a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to simulate assembling puzzle pieces into a standardized layout, likely for a game or matching challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to find connected non-background cells; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement.
 * Frame color is determined from the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use the most common color in the whole component.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain input order.
 * Placement rules: 8-framed components go into specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5, grouped by vertical adjacency into blocks and cycled across lanes); 2-framed into lanes like 12 or 17 based on original position; other frames may need different handling (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 not fully addressed).
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed column offsets; shift entire component horizontally by dx = target_lane - min_c, but only place if nc in bounds (0 to n-1); vertical position stays the same as original.
 * Grouping for 8s: Vertically adjacent components (min_r <= prev_max_r +1) form "blocks" placed alternately in lanes; non-adjacent start new blocks.
 * Easy to miss: Boundaries include out-of-grid adjacencies; components with no explicit boundary might default incorrectly; 1s seem to be background in some cases but not always; test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1).
 * All other non-8/2 components (e.g., framed with 3,4,5,6) are not placed in this attempt, leading to missing elements.
 * Preserve exact shapes: Overwrite output only where placing, no rotation/scaling.
 * n=22 in examples, but generalize to any n.
 * Potential overlap: Placement might overwrite if lanes conflict, but examples avoid it.

```
(This is essential: correctly extracts components, computes bounding boxes, and determines frame via boundary analysis; handles edge cases like no boundary; use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful for ordering components by position; preserves input layout order.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Core placement function; shifts horizontally while keeping rows fixed; bounds-check prevents overflow; reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for 8s (lanes 0/5, grouped blocks) and 2s (lanes 12/17 based on original min_c <=8 or >8) worked perfectly, including background fill with 1s.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., row 0 has [2,2,2,2,2,1,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,2,2]; rows 1-4 have 8s and 2s/3s shifted left with extra 2s in columns 0-4 where expected has 8s and 1s; row 6 has [8,6,6,6,8,1,...] but expected has [1,1,1,1,1,8,6,...] (6s shifted right into lane 6); rows 13-21 mostly match but top has anomalies; overall, 8-block grouping failed for upper components, treating them as separate and placing in wrong lanes, and 3-framed components (e.g., the 3s in expected rows 1-4 col 18-20) not placed at all (missing in generated).
 * 2-framed placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) worked in trains 1-2 but may overgeneralize; in train 3, it placed some 2s incorrectly in upper rows.
 * No handling for other frames (3,4,5,6): These are extracted but never placed, causing missing elements like the 3s,4s,5s,6s in expected train 3 (e.g., 3s in rows 15-17 cols 18-20, 4s in row 13 cols 18-20, 5s in rows 9-11 cols 13-15, 6s in rows 6-8 cols 6-8).
 * place_eights groups vertically adjacent 8-comps into blocks and cycles lanes 0/5, which succeeded in trains 1-2 but failed in train 3 by not grouping a upper block properly (placed small 8s/2s mix in cols 0-4 instead of full 8-frame in cols 0-4).
 * Background correctly 1 in trains, but placement overwrites incorrectly without preserving empty lanes fully.
 * No rotation or vertical shift; assumes original rows preserved, which matches expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It shows background 9 (plausible if most common), with 8-framed components placed in lanes 0/5 (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 has 8/4s, rows 8-12 cols 1-4 has 8/7s/1s, rows 16-20 cols 5-9 has 8/3s), 2-framed in lanes ~12-17 (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 12-16 has 2/4s, rows 13-17 cols 12-16 has 2/6s/3s), which aligns with rules; however, other frames like 1,3,4,6,7 are placed inconsistently or not at all (e.g., 7s in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 but expected likely needs them in a dedicated lane like 6-8; 1s scattered as if background but sometimes framed; 3s in row 16 col 13-15 and row 17 col 12-14 seem shifted wrong, possibly from unhandled 3-frame logic).
 * Missing elements: No clear placement for 5,6,7 frames (e.g., 6s in rows 14-16 cols 1-3 and row 16 col 12-14 look like partial 6-blobs, but expected probably groups them into lane 6 or similar); upper rows 0-2 have 2/4s in col 12-16 and 8/4s misplaced in row 3 col 0-4, suggesting 4-framed not handled (similar to train 3's missing 4s).
 * Overlaps or gaps: Rows 12-13 cols 0-4 empty-ish with 2s/8s bleeding; row 21 all 9s ok, but test likely expects fuller lanes for all frames (e.g., 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s in sequential lanes like 12,17,6, etc.); differences from expected unknown without input grid, but pattern mismatches train 3 errors (unplaced non-2/8 frames, bad grouping), so probably incorrect for similar reasons—e.g., 4s in row 0 col 13-15 and row 3 col 1-3 should be in a right-side lane, not split.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where connected components (blobs of non-background cells) are identified, classified by a "frame" color (most common color on their boundary adjacent to background or grid edges), and rearranged into a standardized output grid. Components framed in 8 are placed in two left-side lanes (columns 0 and 5) with vertical non-overlap and alternating placement, while components framed in 2 are placed in right-side lanes (around columns 12 or 17) based on their original horizontal position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components must be extracted fully, including their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for positioning.
 * Frame determination: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common color among boundary cells. If no boundary (rare, internal component), use most common color in the whole component. This is crucial for classifying as 8-framed or 2-framed.
 * Placement rules: Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c). For 8-framed: Use two lanes (cols 0 and 5); place in a lane without vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; alternate lanes per "group" separated by row gaps; if no fit, force into lane 0. For 2-framed: Place left-leaning (min_c <=8) in col 12 lane, right-leaning in col 17 lane, shifting horizontally to align min_c.
 * Subtleties: Components may touch edges, so boundaries include out-of-bounds checks. Overlap avoidance is only vertical per lane (not horizontal across lanes). Gaps in rows (max_r +1 < next min_r) reset lane alternation. Output initializes to background; placements overwrite without merging or rotation. Colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7 are inner fills, not frames. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions per cell; components can be irregular shapes (e.g., L-shapes or with holes? but code assumes no holes in connectivity).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within component. Grid size n=22 fixed? (from outputs). Ensure placements stay within bounds (code checks nc < n).

    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: Extracts components with bounding boxes and frames correctly; uses DFS for connectivity and boundary detection.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering placements by original top-left position.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for shifting and placing without rotation; bounds-checked.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identified background (1 in example 3), extracted components, computed frames (8 and 2), and separated/sorted them, which worked for training 1 and 2.
 * Placement logic for 8-framed components in lanes 0/5 with vertical overlap avoidance and alternation worked for training 1/2 but failed in 3: Generated misplaced a 3-filled component (originally right-side) into left lanes, and top rows had incorrect 2/3 placements (e.g., row 1 generated [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected all 1's except right; row 2 had 8,2,2,2,8 but shifted wrong).
 * For 2-framed: Placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8, but in example 3, this put a left-leaning 3-component (frame 2?) too far left, overlapping or misaligning with expected right-side 3's in cols 18-20.
 * Boundary/frame detection worked (e.g., 8-frames for boxes around 2/3/4/5/6 fills), but subtle issue: Some components' boundaries might include inner colors if not purely edged, leading to wrong frame (unknown if this caused example 3 failure).
 * Lane alternation reset on row gaps is good but in example 3, global_max_r tracking may have failed to group properly, causing overflow to lane 0 prematurely.
 * No merging of components; assumes disjoint, which held.
 * Overall, core extraction and simple placements succeeded in 2/3 cases, but complex interleaving/overlap in denser grids (example 3) broke.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (common), with 8-framed components (e.g., boxes around 4's,7's,3's,6's) placed in left lanes 0/5-ish, but some shifts are off (e.g., row 3 has 8,4,4,4,8 starting col 0, good; but row 15 has 2,6,6,6,2 in col 0 lane, which should be 8-framed if boxed). 2-framed placements on right (e.g., 4's in cols 13-15, 3's in 14-16) seem aligned to 12/17, but row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col 12 with trailing 2's extending to col 21, which matches no-overwrite but may clip or misalign if original min_c >8. Top rows have 2's misplaced (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but expected might have cleaner 9's). Inner fills (1,3,4,5,6,7) preserved, but a 1-component in rows 8-11 cols 6-8 seems unplaced or merged wrong (appears in lane 5?). Overall, it partially matches rules (lanes used, no overlaps), but likely wrong frames or sorting caused extra 2's on left and missing some 8-boxes on right; doesn't fully make sense without input grid, but differences suggest placement order bug for mixed frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the goal is to identify connected "components" (non-background blobs or objects), classify them by a "frame" value (e.g., based on boundary colors), and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into specific horizontal "lanes" while preserving their internal structure and avoiding overlaps. The output grid maintains the same size and background value, effectively sorting and positioning objects like in a puzzle assembly or inventory layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs, ignoring isolated pixels or background.
 * Components are classified by "frame": the most common value on the boundary pixels (those touching background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully enclosed, rare), use the most common internal value. Frames like 8 or 2 seem to denote object types (e.g., 8 for framed boxes, 2 for simpler shapes).
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to process in reading order.
 * Placement uses fixed lanes: for frame=8 components, lanes at columns 0 and 5 with overlap avoidance based on row ranges (min_r to max_r); alternate lanes per "group" of vertically stacked components, resetting lane choice if a gap in rows (>1). For frame=2, lanes at 12 (leftish) or 17 (rightish) based on original min_c (<=8 or >8).
 * Subtleties: Boundary detection must strictly check adjacency to background/edge; enclosed components fallback to internal mode. Overlap check for lanes considers vertical row spans only (ignores horizontal, assuming fixed lane width fits). Components may shift horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) but rows stay fixed (no vertical shifting). Preserve exact pixel values when placing.
 * Potential misses: Assumes only frames 2 and 8; other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) in grids are internals, not frames—may need handling if they appear as frames. Lanes are hardcoded and may not scale; test grids have n=22, but logic assumes this. No rotation or scaling of components. Gaps between components (e.g., row skips) trigger lane reset for stacking. Background fills unoccupied cells.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components touching multiple frames or irregular shapes; boundary counter only on perimeter, not full component. If no boundary pixels, fallback may misclassify. Placement can clip if dx pushes outside bounds (code checks 0<=nc<n but still places if yes—potential partial clip). Sorting is stable by position, but ties may affect order.

(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary/frame detection is core and helpful; captures bounding boxes and preserves structure accurately. Use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but effective for processing order; helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified background (1), extracted components, classified frames (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frame in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frame in 12/17, resulting in exact match.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated top rows (0-4) misplaced a 2/3 shape on left (e.g., row0 all 2's then 1's; row1-4 has 3's framed by 2's on left, 8's with 2's on right), while expected has 1's background on top row, then right-side 8-frame with internal 2's and 3's starting row1. Also, 6-shape in rows7-9 generated with 8-frame on left but expected shifted right (under 1's in cols0-4, 8-frame cols5-9); unknown why lanes misassigned or order wrong—possibly frame misclassification for top components (3's boundary as 2 vs expected 8?) or sorting/placement not respecting vertical groups.
 * place_component and place_two_components are helpful but hardcoded lanes (12/17) worked for trains 1-2; in train3, two_comps placement correct for bottom but top misplacement suggests eight_comps logic failed (e.g., overlaps not detected, lane alternation wrong).
 * place_eight_components is partially helpful (overlap avoidance via row spans) but buggy: In train3, it stacked 6's too high/early (row6-9 vs expected row6-8 under 1's), and top 8/2/3 not isolated to right lane; global_max_r reset logic may fail on multi-group stacks, forcing default lane0. Doesn't handle left-shifted 1's prefix in expected rows6-8/10-12.
 * Overall, component extraction works (blobs intact), but classification/placement fails when components have irregular frames (e.g., 3-internal as non-8) or vertical spacing triggers wrong lane choice.
 * No unhelpful functions; all build toward solution, but lane hardcoding limits generality (e.g., test has bg=9, different lanes?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct or consistent with puzzle rules; it has irregular placements (e.g., top rows0-3 mix 9-bg, 2/4 on right col12-17, but 8/4 frame on left col0-4 row3-7 overlaps vertically without clear lane separation; row3 has 8's on left then 2/4 on right, but internals like 3's in row5-6 col17-20 shifted oddly).
 * Missing expected structure: Expected likely mirrors train3 pattern—background 9 fills most, with 8-frames in lanes ~0/5 for boxed shapes (e.g., 4's,6's,7's,3's internals), 2-frames in ~12/17; but generated places 2/4 early on right (rows0-2 col12-17), then 8/4 left (rows3-7 col0-4), 8/7 mid-left (rows8-11 col1-4? with 1's internal?), 2/6 mid (rows14-17 col0-4 and col12-16?), bottom 8/3 right-misplaced. This suggests overlap or lane mischoice (e.g., 8-comps not alternating properly, treating spaced groups as one).
 * Does not make sense: Clipping or out-of-bounds? No, but e.g., row12 all 8's/9's but no internals; bottom row18-21 has 8/3 in col5-9 but expected probably stacked cleaner. Differs from train3 failure (misplaced top) by having more left-right mixing; likely same root cause (frame=8 over/under-placement). To fix, refine lane alternation for gaps and classify non-8/2 frames (e.g., if boundary=2 but internal=3, still place as 2-lane?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 20:31:24] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors or shapes) where the task is to identify distinct "objects" or connected components framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8), then horizontally shift and align them into predefined "lanes" (vertical strips) while preserving their internal structure and overwriting the background, effectively organizing scattered objects into a standardized layout without altering their shapes or overlapping them incorrectly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background is the most frequent color (often 0 or 1 or 4 or 9 depending on the grid), and components are 4-connected non-background regions; however, only certain components with "frames" (boundary colors, typically 2 or 8) are relevant—inner components without clear frames or with other boundary colors (e.g., 3,5,6) should not be shifted independently but may be part of larger framed objects.
 * Frames are determined by the most common color on the boundary of a component (cells adjacent to background or edge); if no boundary exists (fully enclosed), fall back to most common internal color—but this can misidentify inner blobs as separate if not handled hierarchically.
 * Lanes are fixed vertical positions (e.g., starting at columns 0,5,12,17), determined by frame color and rough horizontal position (left/right half of grid); shifts are horizontal only (dx = target_lane - min_c), and components must be copied exactly without rotation, scaling, or vertical shifts.
 * Objects often have nested structures: outer frames (2/8) contain inner colored blobs (1,3,4,5,6,7,9); shifting must preserve the entire framed object, including inners, but the program treats them as flat components, leading to fragmentation.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, but overlaps during copying are resolved by later components overwriting earlier ones (background init helps, but missing frames cause gaps).
 * Subtle: Some objects span multiple rows/columns irregularly; boundaries include grid edges; components touching but not connected via non-background are separate; in some examples, left-side objects use frame 8 and align left (lane 0 or 5), right-side use 2 and align right (12 or 17), but position-based lane choice (min_c <=8) fails if objects are offset.
 * Easy to miss: Full object extraction requires recursive or hierarchical component finding (e.g., treat inners as part of outer frame); not all non-background is relevant—ignore small or unframed blobs; output must match expected exactly, including restoring frames where missing in input.
 * Across examples: Train1 has vertical misalignment in bottom lanes (missing left 8-frames); Train2 has incomplete shifting for bottom-right inners (1's and 6's not framed properly); Train3 has extra/missing 2-frames on left and unshifted inners; test has fragmented 8-frames and unaligned 7's/3's/6's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background as most common color; useful for all attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This performs flood-fill for connected components and bounding boxes; essential for object extraction, but broken for nested structures as it flattens inners into separate components.)

```python
def sort_relevant_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    relevant = [c for c in components if c['frame'] in (2, 8)]
    return sorted(relevant, key=lambda c: (c['min_r'], c['min_c']))
```
(Filtering and sorting by frame and position is helpful for ordering, but misses that not all 2/8 are top-level—subtly, some 2/8 are inner frames.)

```python
def shift_and_copy_bb(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r in range(comp['min_r'], comp['max_r'] + 1):
        for c in range(comp['min_c'], comp['max_c'] + 1):
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shifting/copying works for non-overlapping cases, but uses bounding box which includes background gaps inside objects, leading to copied empties; better to copy only component cells.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background and finds connected components via flood-fill, which is a strong start for object extraction.
 * Component dicts with bounding boxes and frame detection (boundary most-common) are helpful but flawed: treats nested inners (e.g., 1's inside 8-frame) as separate components with wrong frames, causing fragmentation and missing outer copies.
 * Filtering to only frame 2/8 is partially correct (matches examples), but over-relies on it—some relevant objects have mixed boundaries or no clear boundary, leading to skipped parts (e.g., Train1 bottom 8-frames not fully copied).
 * Lane determination (0/5 for 8 left, 12/17 for 2 right, based on min_c <=8) works for top objects but fails for bottom ones offset differently; shifts are computed right but copying overwrites incompletely due to separate component processing.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures order but doesn't handle vertical stacking or overlaps well.
 * Train1: Generated misses left 8-frames for bottom objects (e.g., row15 expected [8,8,8,8,8,...] but generated [0,0,...]), and row13 has extra 2's where expected has none; also, row14 generated has 2,2,2,2,2 but expected has none there—unknown why 2-frame was misdetected for unframed area.
 * Train2: Generated has correct top but bottom-right 1's/6's unframed and not shifted fully (e.g., row16 expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,...] but generated [8,1,1,1,8,4,4,...] with lingering 4's); row19 generated misses 4's shift.
 * Train3: Generated adds extra 2's on left (e.g., row0 expected all 1's but generated has 2's); unshifts some inners (e.g., row1 expected 8's then 1's but generated has 8's then 2's/3's misplaced).
 * Function `determine_lane` is helpful but broken for position-based splits (min_c <=8 assumes grid half, but objects vary); not unhelpful overall.
 * No unhelpful functions— all provided are relevant but need refinement for hierarchy.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It fragments objects (e.g., top 4's shifted to lane but missing surrounding 8's in rows 3-6; expected likely has full 8-4-8 frames aligned left like Train1/2).
 * Middle 7's (rows 9-12) are partially framed by 8's but shifted wrong, leaving gaps with 9's; expected should align to a lane (e.g., 5 or 12) with full frame intact, but generated has incomplete 8's on left.
 * Bottom 3's/6's are misaligned (e.g., row16 generated has 2,6,6,6,2 but no left frame; expected probably mirrors Train1 with 8-3-8 or 8-6-8 in lane 0/5).
 * Right-side 2-frames for 3's/6's are copied but not shifted to 12/17, causing overlap with background 9's; overall, lacks hierarchical copying, resulting in missing frames and unaligned inners—does not make sense as a complete organization.

[2025-10-01 20:31:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify the background color, extract connected components (blobs of non-background cells), determine a "frame" color for each component based on its boundary cells, and then rearrange these components into fixed "lanes" on a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to standardize the layout, likely simulating a puzzle where objects are sorted or organized by frame type (e.g., 8 or 2) into specific columns, handling overlaps by alternating lanes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form components via 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Components must track bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for overlap detection and placement; sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent order.
 * Frame color is the most common value on the component's boundary (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary exists (rare, fully enclosed), fall back to most common value in the component— this subtlety handles isolated or inner blobs.
 * Placement rules: For frame=8 components, use lanes at columns 0 and 5, alternating based on index and checking row-overlaps in occupied lanes; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, fallback to 0. For frame=2, place in lane 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17— this assumes binary left/right positioning but may fail if components span mid-grid.
 * Overlap check only considers row ranges (min_r to max_r), ignoring columns, which can cause vertical stacking issues if components have varying heights.
 * Output must exactly replicate component shapes by shifting horizontally (dx = target_lane - original_min_c) without rotation, scaling, or modification; cells outside bounds are ignored, but no vertical shifting occurs.
 * Subtle edge case: Components touching the grid edge count as boundary; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing. In examples, numbers like 1-9 represent colors/patterns, with 4/1/9 often as backgrounds.
 * Potential miss: Not all components are placed (code filters only frame=8 and 2, ignoring others like frame=3 or 6); this works for train1 but fails train2/3 where other frames (e.g., 3-blobs) need handling or are inner to frames.
 * Grid size is fixed at n x something (22 in examples? but code assumes square nxn); outputs are flattened rows but represent 2D.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 correct: Successfully identified background=4, extracted components, framed correctly (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frames in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frames in 12/17 based on position, matching expected layout exactly.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated places some 8-frame components (e.g., the 8-3-3-3 blob in rows 9-12) shifted right to start at column 5 instead of 0, resulting in leading 4's where expected 8's; inner 3-blobs preserved but position wrong; upper 8-9-9-9 and 2-5-5-5 correct, but lower 8-3 and 8-1-6 mismatched lanes; 2-6-6-6 placed in lane 12 correctly but overall layout offset.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated misplaces top-left components, e.g., places a 2-3-3-3 blob at columns 0-4 in rows 1-4 where expected 1-background and 8-2-2-2 in columns 0-4; 8-6-6-6 placed correctly in row7-8 but shifted; 2-5-5-5 in lane12 correct, but entire top section has 2-blobs where 1's expected, and lower 8-3-3-3 in correct position but preceded by wrong 2-placement; suggests failure to filter non-8/2 frames or wrong lane assignment for left-side blobs.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames works in train1 (no conflicts) but fails in train2/3 by not alternating properly or ignoring non-8 components (e.g., bare 3 or 6 blobs get framed wrong or skipped).
 * Component extraction via DFS/stack is solid and helpful, correctly finds connected groups and boundaries; Counter for frame is key but assumes boundary always exists (fallback rare).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures order but may not match puzzle's intended "reading order" if components overlap in rows.
 * Lane hardcoding (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) works for train1 but brittle—train2/3 show need for dynamic lanes or handling more frame types (e.g., place all in sequence?).
 * No vertical adjustment; assumes original rows preserved, which matches examples but could fail if components need stacking.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct (used in all), but boundary detection misses if component has no edge-touch (though examples do); unhelpful if we add diagonal connectivity (but 4-way is right).
 * The main program ties it together but is broken for multi-frame or overlap-heavy cases; place_component is helpful but ignores out-of-bounds (clips, which happened in test?).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct and shows similar issues to train2/3: Background seems 9 (most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-4-4-4, 2-4-4-4, 8-1-1-1 with inner 7? wait, 7 not in input?), but placements are off—e.g., upper 8-4-4-4 starts at col0 row3 correctly? but row8 has 9-8-8-8-8-8-1-1-1-8-9... suggesting 8-frame with inner1 placed at col1-9? mismatched; lower 2-6-6-6 at col0-4 row14-17 but then 8-3-3-3 at col5-9 row16-18, indicating overlap failure like train2 (shifted right instead of alternating lanes).
 * Missing or wrong: No clear handling for inner components (e.g., 7 in row9-10 col2-4, but input likely has no 7—possible extraction error); 2-3-3-3 in row17-20 col5-9 but expected probably lane0/5; overall, looks like 8-frames crammed into lanes 0/5 but with clipping or wrong dx (e.g., row3 [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] good, but row8 shifted left with leading9's where frame should start at0).
 * Does not make sense fully: Inner values preserved (e.g., 4 in 8-frame, 3 in 2-frame), but positions suggest the lane alternation/overlap check is buggy (e.g., multiple 8's overlapping rows, not switching lanes properly); compared to train2, it's a repeat of the shift error, so likely incorrect without expected, but patterns don't align to a clean standardized layout (e.g., lanes not purely occupied without bleed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors or shapes) where the task is to identify distinct "objects" or connected components framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8), then horizontally shift and align them into predefined "lanes" (vertical strips) while preserving their internal structure and overwriting the background, effectively organizing scattered objects into a standardized layout without altering their shapes or overlapping them incorrectly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background is the most frequent color (often 0 or 1 or 4 or 9 depending on the grid), and components are 4-connected non-background regions; however, only certain components with "frames" (boundary colors, typically 2 or 8) are relevant—inner components without clear frames or with other boundary colors (e.g., 3,5,6) should not be shifted independently but may be part of larger framed objects.
 * Frames are determined by the most common color on the boundary of a component (cells adjacent to background or edge); if no boundary exists (fully enclosed), fall back to most common internal color—but this can misidentify inner blobs as separate if not handled hierarchically.
 * Lanes are fixed vertical positions (e.g., starting at columns 0,5,12,17), determined by frame color and rough horizontal position (left/right half of grid); shifts are horizontal only (dx = target_lane - min_c), and components must be copied exactly without rotation, scaling, or vertical shifts.
 * Objects often have nested structures: outer frames (2/8) contain inner colored blobs (1,3,4,5,6,7,9); shifting must preserve the entire framed object, including inners, but the program treats them as flat components, leading to fragmentation.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, but overlaps during copying are resolved by later components overwriting earlier ones (background init helps, but missing frames cause gaps).
 * Subtle: Some objects span multiple rows/columns irregularly; boundaries include grid edges; components touching but not connected via non-background are separate; in some examples, left-side objects use frame 8 and align left (lane 0 or 5), right-side use 2 and align right (12 or 17), but position-based lane choice (min_c <=8) fails if objects are offset.
 * Easy to miss: Full object extraction requires recursive or hierarchical component finding (e.g., treat inners as part of outer frame); not all non-background is relevant—ignore small or unframed blobs; output must match expected exactly, including restoring frames where missing in input.
 * Across examples: Train1 has vertical misalignment in bottom lanes (missing left 8-frames); Train2 has incomplete shifting for bottom-right inners (1's and 6's not framed properly); Train3 has extra/missing 2-frames on left and unshifted inners; test has fragmented 8-frames and unaligned 7's/3's/6's.

                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This performs flood-fill for connected components and bounding boxes; essential for object extraction, but broken for nested structures as it flattens inners into separate components.)

```python
def sort_relevant_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    relevant = [c for c in components if c['frame'] in (2, 8)]
    return sorted(relevant, key=lambda c: (c['min_r'], c['min_c']))
```
(Filtering and sorting by frame and position is helpful for ordering, but misses that not all 2/8 are top-level—subtly, some 2/8 are inner frames.)

```python
def shift_and_copy_bb(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r in range(comp['min_r'], comp['max_r'] + 1):
        for c in range(comp['min_c'], comp['max_c'] + 1):
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shifting/copying works for non-overlapping cases, but uses bounding box which includes background gaps inside objects, leading to copied empties; better to copy only component cells.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background and finds connected components via flood-fill, which is a strong start for object extraction.
 * Component dicts with bounding boxes and frame detection (boundary most-common) are helpful but flawed: treats nested inners (e.g., 1's inside 8-frame) as separate components with wrong frames, causing fragmentation and missing outer copies.
 * Filtering to only frame 2/8 is partially correct (matches examples), but over-relies on it—some relevant objects have mixed boundaries or no clear boundary, leading to skipped parts (e.g., Train1 bottom 8-frames not fully copied).
 * Lane determination (0/5 for 8 left, 12/17 for 2 right, based on min_c <=8) works for top objects but fails for bottom ones offset differently; shifts are computed right but copying overwrites incompletely due to separate component processing.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures order but doesn't handle vertical stacking or overlaps well.
 * Train1: Generated misses left 8-frames for bottom objects (e.g., row15 expected [8,8,8,8,8,...] but generated [0,0,...]), and row13 has extra 2's where expected has none; also, row14 generated has 2,2,2,2,2 but expected has none there—unknown why 2-frame was misdetected for unframed area.
 * Train2: Generated has correct top but bottom-right 1's/6's unframed and not shifted fully (e.g., row16 expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,...] but generated [8,1,1,1,8,4,4,...] with lingering 4's); row19 generated misses 4's shift.
 * Train3: Generated adds extra 2's on left (e.g., row0 expected all 1's but generated has 2's); unshifts some inners (e.g., row1 expected 8's then 1's but generated has 8's then 2's/3's misplaced).
 * Function `determine_lane` is helpful but broken for position-based splits (min_c <=8 assumes grid half, but objects vary); not unhelpful overall.
 * No unhelpful functions— all provided are relevant but need refinement for hierarchy.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It fragments objects (e.g., top 4's shifted to lane but missing surrounding 8's in rows 3-6; expected likely has full 8-4-8 frames aligned left like Train1/2).
 * Middle 7's (rows 9-12) are partially framed by 8's but shifted wrong, leaving gaps with 9's; expected should align to a lane (e.g., 5 or 12) with full frame intact, but generated has incomplete 8's on left.
 * Bottom 3's/6's are misaligned (e.g., row16 generated has 2,6,6,6,2 but no left frame; expected probably mirrors Train1 with 8-3-8 or 8-6-8 in lane 0/5).
 * Right-side 2-frames for 3's/6's are copied but not shifted to 12/17, causing overlap with background 9's; overall, lacks hierarchical copying, resulting in missing frames and unaligned inners—does not make sense as a complete organization.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance; the row-range check is a good approximation, but fallback may cause issues—refine for better overlap handling.)

def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

(This DFS-based component finder with boundary detection for frames is core and helpful; tracks bounds for overlap/placement; handles connected regions correctly but assumes 4-connectivity—may miss diagonal if puzzle uses 8.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(This extracts connected components with DFS, computes bounds, and determines frame; essential for object detection, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify if shapes lack clear outlines.)

```python

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))

(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.)

        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(not (comp['max_r'] < pmin or comp['min_r'] > pmax) for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:

            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: extracts connected components, computes bounding box, and determines frame color accurately; boundary logic handles enclosure well but may misframe if boundaries have mixed colors.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for consistent top-to-bottom placement order.)

```python
def place_eight_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, occupied8: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]], lanes8: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    placed = False
    for lidx, lane in enumerate(lanes8):
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        overlaps = any(comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin for pmin, pmax in occupied8[lidx])
        if not overlaps:
            for r, c in comp['component']:
                nc = c + dx
                if 0 <= nc < n:
                    out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
            occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
            placed = True
            break
    if not placed:
        lidx = 0
        lane = lanes8[lidx]
        dx = lane - comp['min_c']
        for r, c in comp['component']:
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
        occupied8[lidx].append((comp['min_r'], comp['max_r']))
```
(Helpful for 8-frame placement with overlap avoidance, but the +2 gap and force-to-lane-0 logic is buggy for dense vertical stacking.)

```python
def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int) -> None:
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17
    dx = lane - comp['min_c']
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

```

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent pixel colors, requiring the extraction of connected components (objects or blobs) excluding the background, identification of a "frame" color for each component based on boundary cells, and rearrangement of these components into fixed "lanes" (columns or positions) in a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to simulate assembling puzzle pieces into a standardized layout, likely for a game or matching challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to find connected non-background cells; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement.
 * Frame color is determined from the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use the most common color in the whole component.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain input order.
 * Placement rules: 8-framed components go into specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5, grouped by vertical adjacency into blocks and cycled across lanes); 2-framed into lanes like 12 or 17 based on original position; other frames may need different handling (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 not fully addressed).
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed column offsets; shift entire component horizontally by dx = target_lane - min_c, but only place if nc in bounds (0 to n-1); vertical position stays the same as original.
 * Grouping for 8s: Vertically adjacent components (min_r <= prev_max_r +1) form "blocks" placed alternately in lanes; non-adjacent start new blocks.
 * Easy to miss: Boundaries include out-of-grid adjacencies; components with no explicit boundary might default incorrectly; 1s seem to be background in some cases but not always; test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1).
 * All other non-8/2 components (e.g., framed with 3,4,5,6) are not placed in this attempt, leading to missing elements.
 * Preserve exact shapes: Overwrite output only where placing, no rotation/scaling.
 * n=22 in examples, but generalize to any n.
 * Potential overlap: Placement might overwrite if lanes conflict, but examples avoid it.

(This is essential: correctly extracts components, computes bounding boxes, and determines frame via boundary analysis; handles edge cases like no boundary; use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))

(Helpful for ordering components by position; preserves input layout order.)

    for r, c in comp['component']:

        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Core placement function; shifts horizontally while keeping rows fixed; bounds-check prevents overflow; reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for 8s (lanes 0/5, grouped blocks) and 2s (lanes 12/17 based on original min_c <=8 or >8) worked perfectly, including background fill with 1s.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., row 0 has [2,2,2,2,2,1,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,2,2]; rows 1-4 have 8s and 2s/3s shifted left with extra 2s in columns 0-4 where expected has 8s and 1s; row 6 has [8,6,6,6,8,1,...] but expected has [1,1,1,1,1,8,6,...] (6s shifted right into lane 6); rows 13-21 mostly match but top has anomalies; overall, 8-block grouping failed for upper components, treating them as separate and placing in wrong lanes, and 3-framed components (e.g., the 3s in expected rows 1-4 col 18-20) not placed at all (missing in generated).
 * 2-framed placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) worked in trains 1-2 but may overgeneralize; in train 3, it placed some 2s incorrectly in upper rows.
 * No handling for other frames (3,4,5,6): These are extracted but never placed, causing missing elements like the 3s,4s,5s,6s in expected train 3 (e.g., 3s in rows 15-17 cols 18-20, 4s in row 13 cols 18-20, 5s in rows 9-11 cols 13-15, 6s in rows 6-8 cols 6-8).
 * place_eights groups vertically adjacent 8-comps into blocks and cycles lanes 0/5, which succeeded in trains 1-2 but failed in train 3 by not grouping a upper block properly (placed small 8s/2s mix in cols 0-4 instead of full 8-frame in cols 0-4).
 * Background correctly 1 in trains, but placement overwrites incorrectly without preserving empty lanes fully.
 * No rotation or vertical shift; assumes original rows preserved, which matches expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It shows background 9 (plausible if most common), with 8-framed components placed in lanes 0/5 (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 has 8/4s, rows 8-12 cols 1-4 has 8/7s/1s, rows 16-20 cols 5-9 has 8/3s), 2-framed in lanes ~12-17 (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 12-16 has 2/4s, rows 13-17 cols 12-16 has 2/6s/3s), which aligns with rules; however, other frames like 1,3,4,6,7 are placed inconsistently or not at all (e.g., 7s in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 but expected likely needs them in a dedicated lane like 6-8; 1s scattered as if background but sometimes framed; 3s in row 16 col 13-15 and row 17 col 12-14 seem shifted wrong, possibly from unhandled 3-frame logic).
 * Missing elements: No clear placement for 5,6,7 frames (e.g., 6s in rows 14-16 cols 1-3 and row 16 col 12-14 look like partial 6-blobs, but expected probably groups them into lane 6 or similar); upper rows 0-2 have 2/4s in col 12-16 and 8/4s misplaced in row 3 col 0-4, suggesting 4-framed not handled (similar to train 3's missing 4s).
 * Overlaps or gaps: Rows 12-13 cols 0-4 empty-ish with 2s/8s bleeding; row 21 all 9s ok, but test likely expects fuller lanes for all frames (e.g., 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s in sequential lanes like 12,17,6, etc.); differences from expected unknown without input grid, but pattern mismatches train 3 errors (unplaced non-2/8 frames, bad grouping), so probably incorrect for similar reasons—e.g., 4s in row 0 col 13-15 and row 3 col 1-3 should be in a right-side lane, not split.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where connected components (blobs of non-background cells) are identified, classified by a "frame" color (most common color on their boundary adjacent to background or grid edges), and rearranged into a standardized output grid. Components framed in 8 are placed in two left-side lanes (columns 0 and 5) with vertical non-overlap and alternating placement, while components framed in 2 are placed in right-side lanes (around columns 12 or 17) based on their original horizontal position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components must be extracted fully, including their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for positioning.
 * Frame determination: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common color among boundary cells. If no boundary (rare, internal component), use most common color in the whole component. This is crucial for classifying as 8-framed or 2-framed.
 * Placement rules: Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c). For 8-framed: Use two lanes (cols 0 and 5); place in a lane without vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; alternate lanes per "group" separated by row gaps; if no fit, force into lane 0. For 2-framed: Place left-leaning (min_c <=8) in col 12 lane, right-leaning in col 17 lane, shifting horizontally to align min_c.
 * Subtleties: Components may touch edges, so boundaries include out-of-bounds checks. Overlap avoidance is only vertical per lane (not horizontal across lanes). Gaps in rows (max_r +1 < next min_r) reset lane alternation. Output initializes to background; placements overwrite without merging or rotation. Colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7 are inner fills, not frames. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions per cell; components can be irregular shapes (e.g., L-shapes or with holes? but code assumes no holes in connectivity).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within component. Grid size n=22 fixed? (from outputs). Ensure placements stay within bounds (code checks nc < n).

        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for shifting and placing without rotation; bounds-checked.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identified background (1 in example 3), extracted components, computed frames (8 and 2), and separated/sorted them, which worked for training 1 and 2.
 * Placement logic for 8-framed components in lanes 0/5 with vertical overlap avoidance and alternation worked for training 1/2 but failed in 3: Generated misplaced a 3-filled component (originally right-side) into left lanes, and top rows had incorrect 2/3 placements (e.g., row 1 generated [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected all 1's except right; row 2 had 8,2,2,2,8 but shifted wrong).
 * For 2-framed: Placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8, but in example 3, this put a left-leaning 3-component (frame 2?) too far left, overlapping or misaligning with expected right-side 3's in cols 18-20.
 * Boundary/frame detection worked (e.g., 8-frames for boxes around 2/3/4/5/6 fills), but subtle issue: Some components' boundaries might include inner colors if not purely edged, leading to wrong frame (unknown if this caused example 3 failure).
 * Lane alternation reset on row gaps is good but in example 3, global_max_r tracking may have failed to group properly, causing overflow to lane 0 prematurely.
 * No merging of components; assumes disjoint, which held.
 * Overall, core extraction and simple placements succeeded in 2/3 cases, but complex interleaving/overlap in denser grids (example 3) broke.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (common), with 8-framed components (e.g., boxes around 4's,7's,3's,6's) placed in left lanes 0/5-ish, but some shifts are off (e.g., row 3 has 8,4,4,4,8 starting col 0, good; but row 15 has 2,6,6,6,2 in col 0 lane, which should be 8-framed if boxed). 2-framed placements on right (e.g., 4's in cols 13-15, 3's in 14-16) seem aligned to 12/17, but row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col 12 with trailing 2's extending to col 21, which matches no-overwrite but may clip or misalign if original min_c >8. Top rows have 2's misplaced (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but expected might have cleaner 9's). Inner fills (1,3,4,5,6,7) preserved, but a 1-component in rows 8-11 cols 6-8 seems unplaced or merged wrong (appears in lane 5?). Overall, it partially matches rules (lanes used, no overlaps), but likely wrong frames or sorting caused extra 2's on left and missing some 8-boxes on right; doesn't fully make sense without input grid, but differences suggest placement order bug for mixed frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the goal is to identify connected "components" (non-background blobs or objects), classify them by a "frame" value (e.g., based on boundary colors), and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into specific horizontal "lanes" while preserving their internal structure and avoiding overlaps. The output grid maintains the same size and background value, effectively sorting and positioning objects like in a puzzle assembly or inventory layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs, ignoring isolated pixels or background.
 * Components are classified by "frame": the most common value on the boundary pixels (those touching background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully enclosed, rare), use the most common internal value. Frames like 8 or 2 seem to denote object types (e.g., 8 for framed boxes, 2 for simpler shapes).
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to process in reading order.
 * Placement uses fixed lanes: for frame=8 components, lanes at columns 0 and 5 with overlap avoidance based on row ranges (min_r to max_r); alternate lanes per "group" of vertically stacked components, resetting lane choice if a gap in rows (>1). For frame=2, lanes at 12 (leftish) or 17 (rightish) based on original min_c (<=8 or >8).
 * Subtleties: Boundary detection must strictly check adjacency to background/edge; enclosed components fallback to internal mode. Overlap check for lanes considers vertical row spans only (ignores horizontal, assuming fixed lane width fits). Components may shift horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) but rows stay fixed (no vertical shifting). Preserve exact pixel values when placing.
 * Potential misses: Assumes only frames 2 and 8; other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) in grids are internals, not frames—may need handling if they appear as frames. Lanes are hardcoded and may not scale; test grids have n=22, but logic assumes this. No rotation or scaling of components. Gaps between components (e.g., row skips) trigger lane reset for stacking. Background fills unoccupied cells.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components touching multiple frames or irregular shapes; boundary counter only on perimeter, not full component. If no boundary pixels, fallback may misclassify. Placement can clip if dx pushes outside bounds (code checks 0<=nc<n but still places if yes—potential partial clip). Sorting is stable by position, but ties may affect order.

                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)

                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary/frame detection is core and helpful; captures bounding boxes and preserves structure accurately. Use in future.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but effective for processing order; helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified background (1), extracted components, classified frames (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frame in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frame in 12/17, resulting in exact match.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated top rows (0-4) misplaced a 2/3 shape on left (e.g., row0 all 2's then 1's; row1-4 has 3's framed by 2's on left, 8's with 2's on right), while expected has 1's background on top row, then right-side 8-frame with internal 2's and 3's starting row1. Also, 6-shape in rows7-9 generated with 8-frame on left but expected shifted right (under 1's in cols0-4, 8-frame cols5-9); unknown why lanes misassigned or order wrong—possibly frame misclassification for top components (3's boundary as 2 vs expected 8?) or sorting/placement not respecting vertical groups.
 * place_component and place_two_components are helpful but hardcoded lanes (12/17) worked for trains 1-2; in train3, two_comps placement correct for bottom but top misplacement suggests eight_comps logic failed (e.g., overlaps not detected, lane alternation wrong).
 * place_eight_components is partially helpful (overlap avoidance via row spans) but buggy: In train3, it stacked 6's too high/early (row6-9 vs expected row6-8 under 1's), and top 8/2/3 not isolated to right lane; global_max_r reset logic may fail on multi-group stacks, forcing default lane0. Doesn't handle left-shifted 1's prefix in expected rows6-8/10-12.
 * Overall, component extraction works (blobs intact), but classification/placement fails when components have irregular frames (e.g., 3-internal as non-8) or vertical spacing triggers wrong lane choice.
 * No unhelpful functions; all build toward solution, but lane hardcoding limits generality (e.g., test has bg=9, different lanes?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct or consistent with puzzle rules; it has irregular placements (e.g., top rows0-3 mix 9-bg, 2/4 on right col12-17, but 8/4 frame on left col0-4 row3-7 overlaps vertically without clear lane separation; row3 has 8's on left then 2/4 on right, but internals like 3's in row5-6 col17-20 shifted oddly).
 * Missing expected structure: Expected likely mirrors train3 pattern—background 9 fills most, with 8-frames in lanes ~0/5 for boxed shapes (e.g., 4's,6's,7's,3's internals), 2-frames in ~12/17; but generated places 2/4 early on right (rows0-2 col12-17), then 8/4 left (rows3-7 col0-4), 8/7 mid-left (rows8-11 col1-4? with 1's internal?), 2/6 mid (rows14-17 col0-4 and col12-16?), bottom 8/3 right-misplaced. This suggests overlap or lane mischoice (e.g., 8-comps not alternating properly, treating spaced groups as one).
 * Does not make sense: Clipping or out-of-bounds? No, but e.g., row12 all 8's/9's but no internals; bottom row18-21 has 8/3 in col5-9 but expected probably stacked cleaner. Differs from train3 failure (misplaced top) by having more left-right mixing; likely same root cause (frame=8 over/under-placement). To fix, refine lane alternation for gaps and classify non-8/2 frames (e.g., if boundary=2 but internal=3, still place as 2-lane?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:32:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the task is to identify and extract connected components (blobs or "panels") framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2), determine the background as the most frequent color, and rearrange these components into a new grid layout using predefined "lanes" or column alignments to avoid overlaps, simulating a reorganized comic strip or panel arrangement. The rearrangement preserves the relative shapes and internal colors of components but shifts them horizontally based on frame type and original position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9); all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are extracted as potential panels.
 * Components must exclude background; use flood-fill (DFS or BFS via stack) to find them, tracking bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for placement.
 * Frame color determination: For each component, identify boundary pixels (those adjacent to background or grid edge via 4 directions); frame is the most common color among boundary pixels. If no boundary (rare, fully internal), fall back to most common color in the entire component—this is a subtlety that might not trigger often but ensures robustness.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) to process in top-left to bottom-right order, which influences placement sequence and lane alternation.
 * Placement logic separates by frame: Frame=8 components go to left "lanes" (e.g., starting columns 0 and 5), alternating lanes per "row group" (if current min_r > previous max_r +1, reset to lane 0; else alternate) to stack vertically without overlap; check for row-range overlaps in a lane before placing, fallback to other lane, then force to lane 0 if needed. Frame=2 components go to right lanes (e.g., 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), placed directly without alternation.
 * Subtle overlap avoidance: When placing, compute dx = target_lane - original_min_c to shift horizontally; only place if new columns fit (0 to n-1), but code doesn't clip—potential issue if dx causes out-of-bounds. Preserve all internal colors; output initializes to background.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check both out-of-bounds and background adjacency; components might touch edges, so frame could include edge-touching colors. Lanes are fixed (hardcoded), assuming n=22; alternation is per vertical "block" based on row gaps, not strict rows.
 * Components with other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are ignored in placement (only 8 and 2 handled), which worked for training 1-2 but may discard key elements in 3.
 * Grid size n x n (e.g., 22); outputs are flattened rows for comparison, but preserve 2D structure.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background as most frequent color; essential and working across attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components with bounding boxes and frame detection; core and mostly working, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify in complex shapes.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by position; helpful for sequential placement.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic placement shifter; useful but lacks clipping for out-of-bounds, which could silently drop pixels.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt; successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 by correctly extracting and placing frame=8 and frame=2 components without overlaps, preserving shapes and internals.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output misplaced a top-left frame=8 component with internal 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 5-9 (e.g., row 0 has 2's in 5-9, row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in 5-9), while expected shifts it right to columns 17-21 (e.g., row 0 all 1's until 17-21 with 2's, row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in 17-21); this suggests lane alternation or starting column logic failed for the first component, treating it as already in a "continued" block instead of resetting.
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection (identified 8 and 2 correctly), sorting, and basic placement without corruption; lower sections (e.g., rows 6-21) match expected closely, including the 6's, 5's, and bottom 4's/3's.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for eight_comps—code's global_max_r reset logic didn't trigger properly for the top component (min_r=0), leading to placement in lane 0 (dx=0 - min_c, assuming min_c=0) instead of a right-side or adjusted lane; also, two_comps placement seems correct but overshadowed by eight_comps error. Overlap check in place_eight_components alternates but forces to lane 0 if both fail, which may have caused crowding on left.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this iteration demonstrates partial understanding: Core extraction works, but placement heuristics (alternation based on row gaps) are brittle for varying layouts.
 * Function `place_eight_components` is helpful but flawed—its overlap detection uses row ranges but assumes vertical stacking; the fallback to lane 0 overrides alternation, causing left-bias in dense cases like training 3.
 * Function `place_two_components` is simple and worked (placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8), but hardcoded lanes assume specific grid width/original positions.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though frame detection could be refined for multi-color boundaries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming bg=9) partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It extracts and places components similarly (e.g., frame=8 blocks with internals like 4's/3's on leftish lanes, frame=2 with 4's/6's/3's on right), preserving shapes, but shows potential misplacements like the top 2's/4's block in columns 12-16 (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but extends to 21 with extras), and a misplaced 3's in row 3 columns 19-21 overlapping what seems like a separate component; compared to training 3 error, it likely suffers from the same left-bias in eight_comps placement (e.g., 8's with 4's starting in col 0-4, but internals bleeding into col 7+ without proper shift).
 * Issues: Row 3 has 2's in 12-16 then 2,3,3,3,2 in 17-21, suggesting two components merged or overlapped incorrectly; bottom sections (e.g., rows 14-20 with 6's/3's in lanes ~0-4 and 12-16) look aligned but the 8's in row 16 col 5-9 indicate failed alternation, placing in lane 5 instead of alternating properly. Without input grid, can't confirm exact expected, but it doesn't match the clean lane separation in expected training 3 (e.g., no bleed-over in right lanes). This reinforces that placement logic needs better reset for new vertical blocks and stricter overlap rejection.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify the background color, extract connected components (blobs of non-background cells), determine a "frame" color for each component based on its boundary cells, and then rearrange these components into fixed "lanes" on a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to standardize the layout, likely simulating a puzzle where objects are sorted or organized by frame type (e.g., 8 or 2) into specific columns, handling overlaps by alternating lanes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form components via 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Components must track bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for overlap detection and placement; sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent order.
 * Frame color is the most common value on the component's boundary (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary exists (rare, fully enclosed), fall back to most common value in the component— this subtlety handles isolated or inner blobs.
 * Placement rules: For frame=8 components, use lanes at columns 0 and 5, alternating based on index and checking row-overlaps in occupied lanes; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, fallback to 0. For frame=2, place in lane 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17— this assumes binary left/right positioning but may fail if components span mid-grid.
 * Overlap check only considers row ranges (min_r to max_r), ignoring columns, which can cause vertical stacking issues if components have varying heights.
 * Output must exactly replicate component shapes by shifting horizontally (dx = target_lane - original_min_c) without rotation, scaling, or modification; cells outside bounds are ignored, but no vertical shifting occurs.
 * Subtle edge case: Components touching the grid edge count as boundary; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing. In examples, numbers like 1-9 represent colors/patterns, with 4/1/9 often as backgrounds.
 * Potential miss: Not all components are placed (code filters only frame=8 and 2, ignoring others like frame=3 or 6); this works for train1 but fails train2/3 where other frames (e.g., 3-blobs) need handling or are inner to frames.
 * Grid size is fixed at n x something (22 in examples? but code assumes square nxn); outputs are flattened rows but represent 2D.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 correct: Successfully identified background=4, extracted components, framed correctly (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frames in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frames in 12/17 based on position, matching expected layout exactly.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated places some 8-frame components (e.g., the 8-3-3-3 blob in rows 9-12) shifted right to start at column 5 instead of 0, resulting in leading 4's where expected 8's; inner 3-blobs preserved but position wrong; upper 8-9-9-9 and 2-5-5-5 correct, but lower 8-3 and 8-1-6 mismatched lanes; 2-6-6-6 placed in lane 12 correctly but overall layout offset.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated misplaces top-left components, e.g., places a 2-3-3-3 blob at columns 0-4 in rows 1-4 where expected 1-background and 8-2-2-2 in columns 0-4; 8-6-6-6 placed correctly in row7-8 but shifted; 2-5-5-5 in lane12 correct, but entire top section has 2-blobs where 1's expected, and lower 8-3-3-3 in correct position but preceded by wrong 2-placement; suggests failure to filter non-8/2 frames or wrong lane assignment for left-side blobs.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames works in train1 (no conflicts) but fails in train2/3 by not alternating properly or ignoring non-8 components (e.g., bare 3 or 6 blobs get framed wrong or skipped).
 * Component extraction via DFS/stack is solid and helpful, correctly finds connected groups and boundaries; Counter for frame is key but assumes boundary always exists (fallback rare).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures order but may not match puzzle's intended "reading order" if components overlap in rows.
 * Lane hardcoding (0/5 for 8, 12/17 for 2) works for train1 but brittle—train2/3 show need for dynamic lanes or handling more frame types (e.g., place all in sequence?).
 * No vertical adjustment; assumes original rows preserved, which matches examples but could fail if components need stacking.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct (used in all), but boundary detection misses if component has no edge-touch (though examples do); unhelpful if we add diagonal connectivity (but 4-way is right).
 * The main program ties it together but is broken for multi-frame or overlap-heavy cases; place_component is helpful but ignores out-of-bounds (clips, which happened in test?).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct and shows similar issues to train2/3: Background seems 9 (most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-4-4-4, 2-4-4-4, 8-1-1-1 with inner 7? wait, 7 not in input?), but placements are off—e.g., upper 8-4-4-4 starts at col0 row3 correctly? but row8 has 9-8-8-8-8-8-1-1-1-8-9... suggesting 8-frame with inner1 placed at col1-9? mismatched; lower 2-6-6-6 at col0-4 row14-17 but then 8-3-3-3 at col5-9 row16-18, indicating overlap failure like train2 (shifted right instead of alternating lanes).
 * Missing or wrong: No clear handling for inner components (e.g., 7 in row9-10 col2-4, but input likely has no 7—possible extraction error); 2-3-3-3 in row17-20 col5-9 but expected probably lane0/5; overall, looks like 8-frames crammed into lanes 0/5 but with clipping or wrong dx (e.g., row3 [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] good, but row8 shifted left with leading9's where frame should start at0).
 * Does not make sense fully: Inner values preserved (e.g., 4 in 8-frame, 3 in 2-frame), but positions suggest the lane alternation/overlap check is buggy (e.g., multiple 8's overlapping rows, not switching lanes properly); compared to train2, it's a repeat of the shift error, so likely incorrect without expected, but patterns don't align to a clean standardized layout (e.g., lanes not purely occupied without bleed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors or shapes) where the task is to identify distinct "objects" or connected components framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8), then horizontally shift and align them into predefined "lanes" (vertical strips) while preserving their internal structure and overwriting the background, effectively organizing scattered objects into a standardized layout without altering their shapes or overlapping them incorrectly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background is the most frequent color (often 0 or 1 or 4 or 9 depending on the grid), and components are 4-connected non-background regions; however, only certain components with "frames" (boundary colors, typically 2 or 8) are relevant—inner components without clear frames or with other boundary colors (e.g., 3,5,6) should not be shifted independently but may be part of larger framed objects.
 * Frames are determined by the most common color on the boundary of a component (cells adjacent to background or edge); if no boundary exists (fully enclosed), fall back to most common internal color—but this can misidentify inner blobs as separate if not handled hierarchically.
 * Lanes are fixed vertical positions (e.g., starting at columns 0,5,12,17), determined by frame color and rough horizontal position (left/right half of grid); shifts are horizontal only (dx = target_lane - min_c), and components must be copied exactly without rotation, scaling, or vertical shifts.
 * Objects often have nested structures: outer frames (2/8) contain inner colored blobs (1,3,4,5,6,7,9); shifting must preserve the entire framed object, including inners, but the program treats them as flat components, leading to fragmentation.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, but overlaps during copying are resolved by later components overwriting earlier ones (background init helps, but missing frames cause gaps).
 * Subtle: Some objects span multiple rows/columns irregularly; boundaries include grid edges; components touching but not connected via non-background are separate; in some examples, left-side objects use frame 8 and align left (lane 0 or 5), right-side use 2 and align right (12 or 17), but position-based lane choice (min_c <=8) fails if objects are offset.
 * Easy to miss: Full object extraction requires recursive or hierarchical component finding (e.g., treat inners as part of outer frame); not all non-background is relevant—ignore small or unframed blobs; output must match expected exactly, including restoring frames where missing in input.
 * Across examples: Train1 has vertical misalignment in bottom lanes (missing left 8-frames); Train2 has incomplete shifting for bottom-right inners (1's and 6's not framed properly); Train3 has extra/missing 2-frames on left and unshifted inners; test has fragmented 8-frames and unaligned 7's/3's/6's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    n = len(g)

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This performs flood-fill for connected components and bounding boxes; essential for object extraction, but broken for nested structures as it flattens inners into separate components.)

```python
def sort_relevant_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    relevant = [c for c in components if c['frame'] in (2, 8)]
    return sorted(relevant, key=lambda c: (c['min_r'], c['min_c']))
```
(Filtering and sorting by frame and position is helpful for ordering, but misses that not all 2/8 are top-level—subtly, some 2/8 are inner frames.)

```python
def shift_and_copy_bb(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r in range(comp['min_r'], comp['max_r'] + 1):
        for c in range(comp['min_c'], comp['max_c'] + 1):
            nc = c + dx
            if 0 <= nc < n:
                out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic shifting/copying works for non-overlapping cases, but uses bounding box which includes background gaps inside objects, leading to copied empties; better to copy only component cells.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background and finds connected components via flood-fill, which is a strong start for object extraction.
 * Component dicts with bounding boxes and frame detection (boundary most-common) are helpful but flawed: treats nested inners (e.g., 1's inside 8-frame) as separate components with wrong frames, causing fragmentation and missing outer copies.
 * Filtering to only frame 2/8 is partially correct (matches examples), but over-relies on it—some relevant objects have mixed boundaries or no clear boundary, leading to skipped parts (e.g., Train1 bottom 8-frames not fully copied).
 * Lane determination (0/5 for 8 left, 12/17 for 2 right, based on min_c <=8) works for top objects but fails for bottom ones offset differently; shifts are computed right but copying overwrites incompletely due to separate component processing.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures order but doesn't handle vertical stacking or overlaps well.
 * Train1: Generated misses left 8-frames for bottom objects (e.g., row15 expected [8,8,8,8,8,...] but generated [0,0,...]), and row13 has extra 2's where expected has none; also, row14 generated has 2,2,2,2,2 but expected has none there—unknown why 2-frame was misdetected for unframed area.
 * Train2: Generated has correct top but bottom-right 1's/6's unframed and not shifted fully (e.g., row16 expected [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,...] but generated [8,1,1,1,8,4,4,...] with lingering 4's); row19 generated misses 4's shift.
 * Train3: Generated adds extra 2's on left (e.g., row0 expected all 1's but generated has 2's); unshifts some inners (e.g., row1 expected 8's then 1's but generated has 8's then 2's/3's misplaced).
 * Function `determine_lane` is helpful but broken for position-based splits (min_c <=8 assumes grid half, but objects vary); not unhelpful overall.
 * No unhelpful functions— all provided are relevant but need refinement for hierarchy.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It fragments objects (e.g., top 4's shifted to lane but missing surrounding 8's in rows 3-6; expected likely has full 8-4-8 frames aligned left like Train1/2).
 * Middle 7's (rows 9-12) are partially framed by 8's but shifted wrong, leaving gaps with 9's; expected should align to a lane (e.g., 5 or 12) with full frame intact, but generated has incomplete 8's on left.
 * Bottom 3's/6's are misaligned (e.g., row16 generated has 2,6,6,6,2 but no left frame; expected probably mirrors Train1 with 8-3-8 or 8-6-8 in lane 0/5).
 * Right-side 2-frames for 3's/6's are copied but not shifted to 12/17, causing overlap with background 9's; overall, lacks hierarchical copying, resulting in missing frames and unaligned inners—does not make sense as a complete organization.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected "components" (shapes or objects) from an input grid, where components are defined by non-background cells framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2 on boundaries), and rearranging them into fixed "lanes" in an output grid while preserving their shapes and relative vertical order, with the background filling the rest. The goal is to simulate a sorted or organized layout, likely representing a puzzle like reassembling picture elements into shelves or rows without overlaps in assigned positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; isolated cells or shapes without a clear frame might be handled differently, but all non-background must be captured.
 * Frame color for a component is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in the component— this is crucial for classifying into "eight_comps" (frame==8, placed left) vs. "two_comps" (frame==2, placed right), but may misclassify if boundaries are noisy or shared.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve rough vertical/top-to-bottom order.
 * Placement uses horizontal shifts to "lanes": for frame=8, lanes at columns 0 and 5 (alternating with overlap checks based on row ranges; fallback to first lane if overlap); for frame=2, lanes at 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (if >8), no overlap checks—subtle issue: no vertical stacking logic beyond order, and no rotation/flipping; out-of-bounds cells are ignored, potentially cropping shapes.
 * Overlaps are checked only by row ranges (min_r to max_r) per lane, not pixel-level, which can cause partial overlaps or gaps; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component size, leading to clipping if wide.
 * Subtleties: Components might touch or share boundaries, risking merged detection; empty or single-cell components might not have boundaries, defaulting to internal most-common (could misframe); grid is square (n x n, e.g., 22x22), output must match size with background init; preserve exact pixel values during shift, but no rotation or scaling.
 * All non-background must be placed somewhere; if a component doesn't fit a lane, it forces placement anyway (as in code fallbacks), but this can distort; training 3 shows misplacements suggest lane selection or overlap logic fails for certain shapes (e.g., vertical alignment issues).
 * Considerations across attempts: No handling for other frame colors (e.g., if frame=3 or 4 appears, it's ignored/unplaced); sorting is row-then-col, but placement alternates lanes without resetting per "section" properly (global_max_r tries to group, but buggy); test has background=9, frames like 8/2/3/4/6/7, so classification must be robust; potential for multiple components per "object" if disconnected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as most common color; essential and correct.)

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)

```
(This DFS-based component extraction with boundary frame detection is core and helpful; tracks bounds for placement; handles connected components correctly, but may merge adjacent if same color—useful for object isolation.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by top-left; helpful for order preservation.)

(The placement functions like place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful for lane logic but buggy—see below; include for reference but note flaws.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating core component extraction, frame detection, and basic lane placement (left for 8, right for 2) works for simpler layouts with minimal overlaps or standard shapes.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated output places a 2-3-3-3-2 shape in top-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) instead of right lane (expected rows 1-4, cols 17-21 with 3s); also shifts 8-6-6-6-8 to rows 6-8 cols 1-4 but expected in cols 5-9 with leading 1s as background; row 0 has 2s in cols 0-4 (generated) vs. 1s and trailing 2s (expected); row 9 has 8s in cols 5-9 (generated) vs. expected; overall, overlap checks or lane alternation fails, causing left-side crowding and right-side omissions (e.g., 3-3-3 missing in expected positions); unknown why 2-3-3-3-2 frames as 2 but places wrong—possibly min_c threshold or global_max_r reset buggy.
 * place_eight_components: Helpful for alternating lanes 0/5 and overlap avoidance via row ranges, but doesn't work—ignores pixel-level collisions, forces placement if overlap (e.g., stacks vertically without gap), and lane_index %2 alternates blindly without full section grouping; global_max_r reset to 0 on gaps is attempted but fails for spaced components.
 * place_two_components: Simple lane choice (12 if min_c<=8 else 17) works for binary split but doesn't in training 3—likely because some frame=2 components are misclassified or shifted wrong; no overlap check means potential stomping if multiple in same lane.
 * find_components is solid for extraction but boundary detection might miss if component touches another (shared edge not background); Counter for frame is good but assumes majority rules—subtle if ties.
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of extraction/sorting but weak on precise placement rules (e.g., no dynamic lane selection beyond fixed; ignores potential for more lanes or vertical packing); unhelpful: No validation function to check output against input coverage (all pixels placed?); program assumes only frames 2/8, ignores others (e.g., 3/4/5/6 in grids).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places components in expected lanes (e.g., frame=8 shapes in cols 0-4/5-9 left, frame=2 in cols 12-16/17-21 right) but with distortions—e.g., row 3 has 8-4-4-4-8 in cols 0-4, then 2-4-4-4-2 in cols 12-16, but trailing 2-2-3-3-3-2 suggests partial overlap or crop; row 6 has 8-4-4-4-8 left and 9s middle but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, matching a pattern but with extra 2s in col 17-21 (generated [2,3,3,3,2] vs. potential full shape); background=9 fills well, but row 8 has 8-8-8-8-8 full left lane, then scattered 9s and right 9-9-9-9-9—no clear omissions, but shapes like 2-6-6-6-2 in rows 14-17 cols 0-4 seem shifted up/down from expected vertical order; compared to training 3 issues, likely same overlap/lane fallback bug causes minor misalignments (e.g., 7-7-7 in row 9 cols 2-4 inside 8 frame, but if input has vertical span, it might clip); without input grid, hard to verify exact, but output has no overlaps (good) yet fragmented right-side (e.g., row 16 has 2-6-6-6-2 left but 2-3-3-3-2 right starting col 12, suggesting order preserved but lanes misassigned for some); does not fully match puzzle intent—missing cohesive "shelves" (e.g., row 12 all 9s left/mid, but test has placements bleeding); account for variable frames (3,4,6,7) by generalizing beyond 2/8 classification to place all framed components in right lanes if not 8.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes or objects) from a grid that are "framed" by specific boundary colors (primarily 2 or 8), determining the background as the most common color, and rearranging these components into designated horizontal "lanes" in a new output grid while preserving their internal pixel values and avoiding row overlaps for certain frames. The goal is to reposition frames based on their type (e.g., 8's in left lanes, 2's in right lanes) and original position, creating a standardized layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are identified, but only those with frame colors 2 or 8 are relevant—frame is determined by the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge).
 * Boundary cells are those touching the background or grid edges; if no boundary exists (rare), fall back to most common color in the whole component— this can lead to misclassification if components are fully internal.
 * Components are sorted by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain order.
 * For frame 8 components: Place horizontally shifted into lanes at columns 0 or 5 (left side), checking for row-range overlaps with previously placed items in those lanes; if overlap in both, fallback to first lane (0) without checking— this avoids vertical stacking conflicts but may cause unintended overlaps.
 * For frame 2 components: Fixed lanes based on original min_c (12 if <=8, else 17, right side); no overlap checking, simple shift— this assumes binary left/right origin but may fail if components span the threshold.
 * Output starts as all-background grid; placements overwrite by shifting entire component horizontally (dx = target_lane - min_c), but only if new column nc is in bounds [0,n)—clipping can distort shapes if they overhang.
 * Subtle: Lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2), suggesting a 22x22 grid with space for multiple shapes per side; other colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are internals of components and must be preserved exactly during shift.
 * Easy to miss: Components may have internal structures (e.g., 3's inside an 8-frame), so placement must copy all pixels in the component, not just the frame; sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, but original positions influence lane choice only for 2's.
 * Overlap check for 8's is row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, which is efficient but approximate—may allow minor intrusions if shapes have irregular heights.
 * Grid size n=22 implied; all placements are horizontal shifts only (no rotation or vertical adjust); irrelevant components (other frames) are ignored entirely.
 * Potential edge cases: Fully enclosed components without boundary (fallback may mis-frame); large components spanning multiple lanes; background=1 or 9 in examples, but logic is general; test inputs may have different backgrounds/colors.

```
(Basic shift for 2-frames; helpful but simplistic—no overlap check, relies on original position threshold which may misplace spanning components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully extracting and placing 2/8-framed components into lanes without overlaps or distortions, preserving internal colors (e.g., 3's, 5's inside frames).
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., top horizontal 2's bar placed in left columns 0-4 row 0 instead of right columns 17-21; inner 3's in an 8-frame (around rows 1-4, columns 6-9) incorrectly positioned at left (columns 1-3) rather than integrated into right-side 8-frame (expected columns 18-20); additionally, a 6's shape (rows 6-8) shifted to left 8-lane but expected more centered or differently; bottom 3's in 8-frame (rows 14-17) correctly framed but overall layout has extra 2's intrusions (e.g., row 2 has misplaced 2's inside 8's).
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection via boundary, filtering to 2/8, sorting, and basic shifting preserved shapes in 1/2; overlap avoidance for 8's prevented vertical collisions in simple cases.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for 2's too rigid (min_c <=8 threshold failed for components originating rightward); 8's placement allowed fallback overlaps or wrong lane choice, leading to left-biased positioning; no pixel-level overlap resolution, causing subtle distortions (e.g., unknown reason for 3's not aligning in expected right 8-frame—possibly sorting or dx calc error); ignored other potential frames or internals.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and reusable; place functions are helpful but need refinement for overlap and lane logic.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though the overlap check in place_eight_shape is approximate and contributed to train3 failure (not broken, but insufficient for complex layouts).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic (background=9, extracts 2/8-frames, places 8's in left lanes 0/5 with some overlaps avoided, 2's in right 12/17), resulting in shapes like 4's inside 2-frame (rows 1-3, columns 12-16), 3's in right 2-frames (rows 4-7 and 16-19), 7's in middle 8-frame (rows 9-11, columns 2-4), 6's in left 2-frame? (rows 14-15, columns 1-3, but framed by 2's—wait, frame detection may have misclassified), and horizontal 8-bars at rows 7 and 20.
 * It does not look fully correct without the input grid, but inconsistencies suggest flaws: e.g., a 3's shape in row 4 columns 18-20 inside what seems a 2-frame, but placement has irregular clipping (row 3 has 2's extending oddly); left 8-frames have 4's and 7's internals preserved, but a 1's horizontal in row 8 columns 6-9 looks like an unframed or misextracted component (program ignores non-2/8, so possibly a bug in filtering); right-side 2-frames have overlapping 3's and 2's (rows 16-19), indicating failed overlap logic extension; overall, it mirrors train3 issues (left-biased or misplaced internals), so likely incorrect for test—e.g., expected might route all 8's cleanly to left without 1's intrusions, and 2's to right without clipping.
 * To handle test: Extend overlap checking to 2-frames; use more lanes or dynamic positioning; verify frame on full boundary to avoid misclassifying internals like 1's as frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) that are framed by specific colors (like 8 or 2), extract them while preserving their internal structure, and rearrange them into predefined "lanes" or positions in a new output grid filled with the background color, likely to form a standardized layout such as panels or strips. The rearrangement rules appear to group and position components based on their frame color, original positions (e.g., row-based for some, column-based for others), and sorting to maintain order, but the exact placement logic (e.g., lanes at specific columns) must align with implicit puzzle rules for vertical or horizontal alignment.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9), and components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells.
 * Components must be identified via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with stack), tracking bounds (min/max row/col) for placement offsets.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color on the boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles enclosed shapes but can misidentify if boundaries are sparse.
 * Only components with specific frame colors (8 for one group, 2 for another) are rearranged; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are ignored or left in place? No, the code only places 8-framed and 2-framed, filling rest with background, but expected outputs retain some non-framed elements in positions, suggesting all visible non-background must be preserved or repositioned differently.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) preserves top-to-bottom, left-to-right order within frame groups.
 * Placement for 8-framed: Uses dynamic "lanes" (col 0 or 5) based on row gaps (if min_r > max_row8 +1, new lane at 0, else shift to 5), with dx offset to align min_c to lane—subtlety: this assumes vertical stacking with horizontal shifts to avoid overlap, but fails if components span rows incorrectly or if lanes need to alternate differently (e.g., for multi-panel layouts).
 * Placement for 2-framed: Fixed lanes (12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), suggesting left/right split based on original horizontal position, but this binary threshold may not capture vertical or nested components.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries include out-of-grid checks, so edge-touching cells count as boundary even without background. Components may be nested or adjacent, but code treats them separately. Outputs must exactly match shapes/colors, including internal non-frame colors (e.g., 3 inside 2-frame, 6 inside 8-frame). Puzzle likely ignores or backgrounds non-8/2-framed components entirely, but expected shows some retained (e.g., row0 2's in expected train3 are not framed?). Overlaps during placement are prevented by dx checks, but out-of-bounds are clipped (only place if 0<=nc<n). Easy to miss: Frame detection fails if boundary has mixed colors (e.g., most_common picks wrong if ties). Row-based lane switching for 8's assumes sequential vertical placement, but may need per-component row checks or global layout planning.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might have overplaced all components; current handles separation but misaligns lanes (e.g., places top 8's too right). Consider rotation/flipping? No evidence. Grid size n=22 fixed? Yes from outputs.

(This is core for extracting components with bounds and frame; helpful but boundary/frame logic can err on mixed boundaries; fix min_c typo if present. Essential for all future attempts.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering components top-to-left; keeps relative positions.)

The placement functions (place_component, place_eight_components, place_two_components) are partially helpful for shifting but broken for lane logic (see below); retain place_component for copying, but revise lane assignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection (8/2 separation), sorting, and basic placement worked for simpler layouts where 8-comps stacked in left lanes without row gaps, and 2-comps split left/right correctly.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated placed top 8-framed component (rows 1-5, cols ~5-9) shifted to cols 5-9 instead of 0-4; row0 2's placed early at cols 5-9 instead of 17-21; bottom 8-framed (rows 14-18, cols 0-4) correct, but internal 3's misplaced vertically (row15 has 4's instead of 3's? Wait, no—generated row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2; expected row15: 8,3,3,3,8 then 1's then 2,4,4,4,2—actually similar, but top mismatch dominates. Row1 generated 8's at 5-9 vs expected at 0-4; row6-11 8's with 6's correct but shifted? Overall, lane switching for 8's failed due to row gap detection (max_row8 not updating properly for multi-block 8's), placing second 8-block overlapping or wrong lane. 2-comps in rows 8-12 placed ok but top 2's (row0) treated as 2-framed wrongly or mis-laned (min_c >8? No, placed at lane 5 erroneously). Frame detection possibly wrong for unfilled top (generated row0 2's as separate comp with frame 2?).
 * place_eight_components broken: Lane logic (if min_r > max_row8 +1 then lane=0 else 5) assumes strict vertical sequencing but doesn't handle disconnected 8-blocks (e.g., top and bottom 8's in train3 should be lane 0 and then 5? But generated put top at 5). max_row8 updates per comp but starts -1, so first always lane=0, but in generated top went to 5—bug in code? Code shows lane=0 if gap, else 5, but perhaps comp order after sort causes wrong max_row8 propagation.
 * place_two_components unhelpful/broken: Fixed lanes 12 (if min_c<=8) or 17 assume horizontal split, but in train3 top 2's (likely min_c high) went to wrong lane (5?), and bottom 2's with internals (4's,5's) placed at 12/17 but expected has 2,3's at 17-21 with different internals—suggests 2-comps need row-based lanes too, not just col threshold.
 * find_background and find_components essential and worked across all (correctly isolated blobs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond placements; avoid global out init without placing non-8/2 comps (code backgrounds them, but expected retains some like row0 2's if not framed).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Background is 9 (correct mode), but placements seem misaligned similar to train3—e.g., top 2-framed (rows0-2, cols12-16 with 4's) placed at cols12-16, but a 8-framed with 4's (rows3-7, cols0-4) placed correctly left; however, another 8 with 3's (rows16-20, cols5-9?) shifted to cols0-4 overlapping? Wait, row16: 9's then 8,3,3,3,8 at cols5-9? No, output row16: 9,9,... then 2,6,6,6,2 at cols5-9, then 2,2,2,2,2 at 12-16—suggests 8-comps placed in lanes 0/5 but internals (3's,4's) wrong (row4 has 4's in 8-frame but placed with 2's nearby). Bottom 2,3's at cols12-16 row17-20 correct shape but possibly wrong lane (expected likely cols17+ like train3). 7's in 8-frame rows9-12 placed at cols5-9 ok, but 6's above at cols5-9. Overall, doesn't match a clean panel layout—overlaps or missing shifts (e.g., row3 8's at 0-4, but row8 8's at 5-9 with 8's extending wrong); lane logic failed again for multi-8 blocks, and 2-comps not all right-aligned (some at 12 vs 17). Subtle: Test has more nested frames (3 in 2, 4 in 8, 7 in 8), but output preserves internals ok, just positions wrong—suggests core extraction works, but placement needs dynamic cols based on count or rows, not fixed 0/5/12/17. To handle test, update 8-placement to alternate lanes per block (e.g., col = 0 + 5*block_index), and 2-placement to vertical lanes (e.g., row-based for right side).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract connected components (shapes) from an input grid, identify their "frame" colors based on boundary cells, and rearrange them into a new output grid by placing them in specific horizontal "lanes" (columns) without overlapping, while filling the rest with the background color. The placement rules prioritize components framed in color 8 into early lanes (0 and 5), and those framed in 2 into later lanes (12 or 17, depending on original position), maintaining their relative shapes and colors during relocation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid; all non-background connected regions (4-directional adjacency) are treated as components.
 * Components must be sorted by their top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to preserve order.
 * Frame color is determined by the most common color among boundary cells of a component (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, fall back to most common in the whole component—this handles fully enclosed shapes but can be error-prone if boundaries are ambiguous.
 * Placement for 8-framed components: Try lanes 0 and 5 in order, shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) only if no vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; fallback to lane 0 if both fail, which risks overlaps or clipping.
 * Placement for 2-framed components: Deterministic lanes based on original min_c (<=8 -> lane 12, else 17), with horizontal shift; no overlap checking, assuming they fit without conflict.
 * Subtlety: Components may include internal colors different from frame (e.g., a 2-frame around 3's or 5's), so preserve exact pixel colors when placing—don't recolor to frame.
 * Clipping: If shift causes parts to go out-of-bounds (nc <0 or >=n), they are dropped, which can distort shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap check for 8-components only considers vertical row ranges (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, so side-by-side in same lane might overlap undetected; lanes are fixed and don't adapt to component width.
 * Grid size n x n (here n=22), output starts as background-filled; only place detected components, ignore others (e.g., no handling for frames like 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 explicitly).
 * Potential issues: Assumes all relevant components have frames 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are placed only if part of a 2/8-framed component, but unplaced components leave gaps.

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but essential for ordering components by appearance.)

(The main program function integrates these but has placement bugs; the component extraction is solid across attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating good background detection, component extraction, and basic lane placement for 8/2 frames).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in multiple regions—e.g., rows 1-4 have 3's placed left-of-center with misplaced 2's and 8's bleeding into top (generated: [2,3,3,3,2,...] in row1, but expected: [8,8,8,8,8,...] on left and 3's on right in rows 15-17); row 6 has 8's full-width but expected has gaps with 1's; rows 7-8 have 6's shifted right in generated but expected in center with 1's on left; unknown reason for exact misplacement, possibly overlap check failing or wrong lane assignment for a 3-containing component.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) worked for order in trains 1/2 but likely caused wrong prioritization in train 3, leading to 8-components overwriting or skipping lanes.
 * Boundary frame detection mostly worked (correctly IDs 8/2 frames in trains 1/2) but may misclassify in train 3 if boundaries have mixed colors (e.g., a component with 3 interior but 2/8 boundary).
 * Placement logic for 8-components (lanes 0/5 with overlap check) succeeded in trains 1/2 but failed in train 3, as evidenced by 8's appearing in wrong columns (e.g., expected 8's in col 0-4 rows 1-5, but generated has them mixed with 2/3); fallback to lane 0 likely caused clipping or overlap.
 * 2-component placement (lanes 12/17 based on min_c <=8) worked in trains 1/2 but in train 3, resulted in 5's and 2's in correct lanes but wrong vertical alignment (e.g., row 9 generated has 2,5,5,5,2 but expected similar; however, surrounding 1's are wrong).
 * No handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 components not extracted/placed if not 2/8-framed), which is fine if puzzle only requires 2/8 but may explain gaps in train 3.
 * Overall, component extraction and background/frame logic demonstrate core understanding, but placement (esp. overlap and lane selection) is brittle and doesn't adapt to varying component widths/heights.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears significantly distorted compared to patterns in training examples—e.g., background is 9 (plausible as most common), but 8-framed components are placed erratically (e.g., rows 3-7 have 8's and 4's mixed in cols 0-4, but with 2's and 3's intruding in row 3 col 16-21, unlike clean lane separation in expected train outputs); 2-framed components like 4's and 3's are shifted to lanes ~12-17 but overlap or clip (e.g., row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col12-16 but then 2,2,3,3,3,2 spilling right, suggesting failed overlap or wrong dx).
 * Top rows (0-2) have 2's and 4's in lane ~12 but with 9's dominating left, whereas training expects structured lanes from top; row 16 has 2,6,6,6,2 in early cols mixed with 8's, indicating possible mis-sorting or frame misdetection (6's should be interior to a frame).
 * Bottom rows (20-21) are all 9's (background), which is fine, but mid-sections like rows 8-13 show 8's in col1-4 with 1's/7's interior, but then empty lanes, suggesting unplaced components or clipping—does not match the full-lane filling seen in train expecteds.
 * Overall, test output lacks the clean horizontal lane structure (e.g., no clear separation of 8-lanes at 0/5 and 2-lanes at 12/17); shapes are preserved but positions are wrong, likely due to same overlap/fallback issues as in train 3—e.g., a 4-component is split across lanes, and 3's appear in multiple mismatched spots (rows 3,5-6,16-19).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (shapes or objects), determine their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries or overall), and reposition specific components (those framed by 2 or 8) into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated "lanes" or columns while avoiding overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or sorting the shapes into a new layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs/shapes.
 * For each component, compute boundaries (cells adjacent to background or grid edge) and use the most common color on those boundaries as the "frame" (fallback to overall most common if no boundaries); only process components with frame 2 or 8.
 * Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to ensure consistent order.
 * Placement: For frame=8 components, try to place in specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 or 5) without vertical row overlaps (check min/max_r against occupied ranges per lane); if overlap, force into first lane. For frame=2, place in fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if left-leaning, 17 if right-leaning) without overlap checks.
 * Output grid starts as all background; copy component pixels horizontally shifted (no rotation or scaling); ensure shifts keep pixels within bounds [0, n-1].
 * Subtleties: Components may have internal colors different from frame (e.g., filled shapes); boundaries must correctly identify edge-touching cells; overlap avoidance is lane-specific and vertical-only (row ranges); sorting prevents placement order issues; unhandled frames (e.g., other numbers like 3,4,5,6) are omitted entirely; grids are square (n x n, here n=22); potential for multi-lane occupation or forced placements if overlaps occur.
 * Easy-to-miss: Frame detection fails if boundaries are empty (rare, but fallback to internal); horizontal shifts assume rigid translation without clipping internals; lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), possibly puzzle-specific; components may span multiple rows/columns, so min/max tracking is crucial for overlap checks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or vertical shifting; assume all relevant shapes are 2/8-framed; background fills empty output areas; test inputs may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1 or 2).

(Handles overlap-avoidant placement for frame=8; the overlap check uses negation correctly but assumes vertical-only conflicts; forced placement to lane 0 if all overlap.)

def place_two_shape(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, n: int):
    lane = 12 if comp['min_c'] <= 8 else 17

        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
( Simple shift for frame=2 based on original position; no overlap check, which may cause issues in dense areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT – all components properly extracted, framed, sorted, and placed in lanes without overlaps or mis-shifts.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT – similar success, indicating core extraction and placement logic works for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT – generated output has misplaced shapes: top-left 3's blob is shifted to columns ~1-3 instead of right-side (expected columns 17-21 framed by 2); bottom-left 3's (framed by 8) are in rows 15-17 columns 1-3 but expected in rows 15-18 columns 17-21; 6's blob is in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 (expected rows 6-8 columns 1-4? wait, actually expected has 6's in rows 6-8 columns 6-8 but framed differently? No, expected shifts 6's to left under 8-frame); upper 3's in row 1-4 expected right but generated leftish; overall, lane assignments or overlap handling failed for multiple 2/8 frames, leading to clustered left-side placements instead of distributed lanes; unknown why sorting or frame detection didn't catch the right-side 2-framed 3's correctly.
 * The program filters only frame 2/8 components, omitting others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 internals stay in place? No, output shows only placed ones, others omitted); this worked for train 1/2 but missed in train 3 where multiple similar frames overlap in lanes.
 * find_components is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection may undercount frames if shapes touch edges subtly.
 * place_eight_shape's overlap check prevented some placements but forced others incorrectly, causing pile-up in lane 0.
 * place_two_shape's binary lane choice (12 vs 17 based on min_c <=8) is too simplistic, possibly misplacing right-leaning shapes in train 3.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant but need tuning for overlap/lane logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: it correctly identifies background as 9, extracts and places several 2/8-framed components (e.g., 3's and 4's shifted to right lanes ~12-17, 6's to left ~1-4, 7's in middle ~2-4 rows 9-11, 1's minimally placed), and avoids some overlaps in lanes 0/5/8-ish for 8-frames; however, it shows anomalies like fragmented 2's and 3's in row 3 columns 16-21 (possibly clipped or mis-sorted), 4's duplicated across rows 3-5 and 14-16 (suggesting overlap failure or double-placement), and bottom 3's in rows 17-19 columns 6-9 instead of expected right/bottom distribution; upper 4's in row 4 columns 1-4 look shifted correctly but 8-frame around them is incomplete (missing full enclosure); overall, it demonstrates core understanding (extraction/placement) but fails on precise lane distribution and overlap resolution, likely placing too many in left lanes and omitting or clipping some right components – this mirrors train 3 issues, so lanes need dynamic assignment or better checks to handle denser test grids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (shapes) framed by specific colors (like 2 or 8) are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into designated "lanes" (columns) in an output grid, while preserving the background color and avoiding overlaps in row ranges for certain frames. The goal is to relocate these framed objects horizontally to fixed positions without altering their internal structure or vertical positioning, simulating a sorting or alignment of visual elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-connected, i.e., up/down/left/right) are identified using flood-fill or stack-based traversal.
 * For each component, the "frame" is determined by the most common color on its boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edges); if no boundary exists (e.g., fully internal), fall back to the most common color in the component— this can lead to misclassification if components are enclosed.
 * Only components with frame colors 2 or 8 are relocated; others (e.g., frames 3,4,5,6) stay in place or are ignored in placement, but the code filters only 2/8, potentially leaving others unmoved incorrectly.
 * Placement rules: Shapes with frame 8 are placed in specific lanes (columns 0 or 5) by shifting horizontally (dx = lane - min_c), preferring non-overlapping row ranges (min_r to max_r); if overlap, force into first lane. Frame 2 shapes go to lane 12 (if original min_c <=8) or 17 (otherwise), without overlap checks.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing, which affects placement order.
 * Subtlety: Overlap check for 8-frames only considers row ranges (comp['min_r'] < pmax + 2 and comp['max_r'] >= pmin), allowing a 1-row gap but potentially causing tight packing issues; the +2 might be an attempt to allow spacing but can fail if shapes are vertically adjacent.
 * Grids are 22x22 (n=22), lanes are hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), suggesting fixed puzzle structure; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (if nc <0 or >=n, skipped).
 * Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly when shifting; background fills the output initially.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components might touch but not merge if different colors (code correctly handles color-agnostic connectivity for non-bg).
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (no dx possible), zero-boundary components, or multiple components sharing rows across lanes.
 * All attempts assume only 2/8 frames matter, but training 3 shows other frames (3,4,5,6) need relocation or different handling, as expected has 3's moved inside 2-frames.

            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for simple 2-frame shifts, but lacks overlap checks, leading to potential collisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt shown, but it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (full correct outputs), demonstrating core component extraction, frame detection, and lane-based shifting work for simpler cases with fewer or non-overlapping 8-frames.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated a misplaced small 3-shape (rows 1-4, cols 1-4 as 2 3 3 3 2) where expected has it in rows 1-4, cols 17-21; also, an 8-frame with internal 2's in rows 2-4 cols 6-9 (generated) vs. expected clean 8's with 2's elsewhere; bottom 8-frame with 3's is shifted left in generated (cols 0-4 rows 14-18) but expected has it in cols 0-4 rows 14-18 correctly, but surrounding 1's/bg differ—likely due to incorrect filtering (only moving 2/8 frames, leaving 3/4/5 unmoved or misframed).
 * Sorting and placement order caused top components (e.g., the 3-blob) to be treated as frame-2 and placed early in wrong lanes (e.g., lane 12 instead of 17), overlapping or shifting incorrectly.
 * Overlap logic for 8-frames allowed +2 gap but forced placement into lane 0 on conflict, which worked for train 1/2 but caused vertical crowding in train 3 (e.g., multiple 8's stacking too close, altering internal 2/3 placements).
 * Frame detection mostly correct but subtle issue: In train 3 generated, a component with mixed boundary colors picked wrong frame (e.g., 3-blob framed as 2?), leading to it being relocated instead of staying or moving differently.
 * No handling for non-2/8 frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 blobs need to be placed inside 2/8 frames or in other lanes), causing expected internal fillings (like 3's inside bottom 2-frame) to be missing in generated.
 * Component extraction is solid (no missed merges or splits noted), but place_two_shape's lane choice (based on original min_c <=8) fails when components shift across midline.
 * The program initializes output with bg and only places 2/8, leaving other areas bg— this mismatched train 3 where expected has preserved non-2/8 elements in new positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows plausible lane placements: 8-frames in cols 0-4 (multiple stacked vertically, e.g., rows 3-7 with internal 4's, rows 8-11 with 7's, rows 14-20 with 3's); 2-frames in cols 12-16 (e.g., rows 0-2 with 4's, rows 15-19 with 3's and 6's); background 9 elsewhere, with some preserved internals like 1's in col 7-9.
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to train 3, small components (e.g., 4-blob in rows 0-2 cols 12-16) are placed as if framed by 2, but expected likely requires them inside specific 8/2 frames (e.g., 4's should be internal to a 8-frame, not standalone); a 3-blob in rows 3-6 cols 18-21 seems shifted wrong, overlapping a 2-frame; vertical stacking of 8-frames (e.g., rows 3-7 and 14-20) has no gaps, potentially colliding internals (unknown if expected allows this); top row has 2's in col 12-16 but expected might have them elsewhere based on sorting.
 * Missing preservation: Non-2/8 elements like the 1-blob (rows 8-11 col 7-9) stayed in place, but expected probably relocates them inside lanes; 6-blob (rows 14-17 cols 1-4) is placed inside what looks like a 2-frame, but position differs from train 3 pattern.
 * Overall, it follows the same logic as train 3 (which failed), so likely incorrect in frame classification (e.g., treating 3/4/6 as 2-frames) and lane assignment (e.g., 3's in col 18-21 instead of integrated); does not account for embedding smaller shapes into larger frames during placement.
 * To handle test, need better frame detection for inners (e.g., recursive component finding inside frames) and dynamic lanes for non-8/2 (e.g., 3/4 to col 17-21 inside 2's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to identify "objects" consisting of framed shapes (bounded by specific frame colors 2 or 8) and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by shifting them horizontally into designated vertical "lanes" while preserving their internal structure, against a background of the most common color. The output rearranges these objects from left to right in sorted order, placing 8-framed objects on the left side and 2-framed objects on the right side, without overlaps in row ranges for left placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells are considered for connected components.
 * Connected components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background color; each component gets a bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * A component's "frame" color is determined from its boundary cells (those touching the grid edge or background): most common color among those boundary cells' own colors. If no boundary cells (e.g., fully enclosed inner shapes not touching background), use the most common color in the entire component. Only components with frame color 2 or 8 are considered "framed objects" and extracted/placed; inner components without 2/8 frames are ignored unless copied via bounding box.
 * When placing, copy the entire bounding box contents from the original grid (not just the component cells), which includes inner colors/shapes within the frame (e.g., a 8-frame around 5's copies both 8's and 5's). This effectively extracts whole objects but can lead to overwriting if bounding boxes overlap in the output.
 * Sort candidate components (frame 2 or 8) by (min_r, min_c) for top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * For frame=8 objects: place in left "lanes" starting at column 0, then 5; check for row-range overlaps with previously placed objects in that lane (using occupied row intervals); if no overlap, place there by shifting dx = lane_start - min_c; if neither lane works, force to lane 0 (can cause overlaps/overwrites).
 * For frame=2 objects: place in right "lanes" at column 12 (if original min_c <=8, i.e., originally leftish) or 17 (if original min_c >8, i.e., originally rightish); no overlap checking, just shift dx = lane_start - min_c (can cause overlaps/overwrites with other right objects or background).
 * Subtlety: Bounding box copying includes any original grid cells in the row/col range, even if not part of the component (e.g., inner holes or adjacent non-component cells), which preserves object integrity but risks copying unintended background or adjacent elements if bounding box is loose.
 * Subtlety: Frame detection relies on boundary touching background/edge; fully internal same-color blobs without touching background get frame=their own color, so only framed objects (touching via boundary) with 2/8 are selected—unframed inners are skipped unless bounding box captures them.
 * Subtlety: No rotation, scaling, or modification of shapes; exact row-preserving horizontal shift only. Output starts as full background grid.
 * Subtlety: Overlap avoidance is only for frame=8 lanes (row-interval check); frame=2 has none, leading to potential overwrites. Forcing to lane 0 for unplaceable 8's can overwrite previous placements.
 * Subtlety: Grid size n=22 (inferred from outputs); placements clip if nc out of bounds (0 <= nc < n).
 * Easy to miss: Components are same-color connected, so frames (e.g., 8's) and inners (e.g., 5's) are separate components; only frame components trigger placement, but their bounding boxes pull in inners. If a frame has holes with different colors, they get copied as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary count uses g[r][c] of boundary cells (own color), so for a pure frame component, frame=frame_color; but if boundary includes mixed (unlikely in connected same-color), it could differ.
 * Consideration: Sorting ensures order, but placement order can cause later objects to overwrite earlier ones in same lane if no overlap check (especially for frame=2).
 * Consideration: Original position (min_c <=8) decides lane for frame=2, assuming original grid has left/right separation.
 * Consideration: If multiple objects share rows, lane assignment for 8's may fail avoidance, leading to forced overlaps.
 * Unhelpful: No diagonal connectivity (only 4-dir); no color changes during copy; no merging of adjacent components.

```

(Note: The main program function integrates these; it's helpful for extraction but needs better overlap handling in placement. No types like classes needed beyond Dict for components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core extraction via bounding box copy works (pulls in inner colors like 5's inside 8-frames), as seen in all generated outputs matching expected object shapes where placed correctly.
 * Frame detection correctly identifies 2/8-framed objects and ignores unframed inners (e.g., standalone 5's not placed directly).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order in train 2 (correct).
 * Lane logic partially works: left lanes 0/5 for 8-frames with overlap avoidance succeeds in simple cases (train 2); right lanes 12/17 for 2-frames based on original min_c <=8 succeeds in train 2.
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated places a 3's inner (from left 8-frame?) into right lane ~12-16 in row 11 (shows 2,3,3,3,2,2,9,9,9,2), overwriting expected 2's (2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,2); likely a left 8-frame object with 3's inner got misassigned or forced to right, or sorting/placement order caused overwrite of 2-frame area. Row 13 generated has full 2's row (correct), but overall object positions differ subtly in right side.
 * Train 2 correct: All placements match expected, including left 8-frames with inners (e.g., 6's,5's) in lanes 0/5 without overlaps, right 2-frames with inners (e.g., 4's) in 12/17; demonstrates core logic handles non-overlapping multi-object cases well.
 * Train 3 incorrect: Generated places extra small 2's block in row 2 columns 12-16 (8,2,2,2,8,... then 2,2,2,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2), where expected has background 1's (8,2,2,2,8,...1,1,1,1,1,...2,3,3,3,2); likely a minor 2-component (perhaps a thin frame or artifact) was extracted and placed in lane 12 without need, overwriting background. Other rows (e.g., 3's in right) match, but this extraneous placement breaks it. Background 1's in middle/right are preserved elsewhere.
 * Placement loop copies full bounding box (good for inners), but lack of overwrite protection for frame=2 lanes causes issues in train 1/3 (e.g., later 2-frame overwrites earlier or spills into wrong lane).
 * Overlap check for 8-lanes is row-range only (ignores column overlaps within lane), which is fine for vertical lanes but fails if bounding boxes are wide post-shift.
 * find_components is essential and correct for extraction (handles boundaries well); sort_components is helpful for ordering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (find_background, find_components, sort_components) are relevant, though placement in main program needs refinement (e.g., better lane choice or post-placement merge).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect in details, similar to train 1/3 errors: It correctly extracts and places 8-framed objects on left (e.g., row 3-6: 8,4,4,4,8 in lane ~0-4; row 8-11: 8,1/7,8 in lane ~0-4 and 8,8,8,8,8 in lane ~5?), copying inners like 4's,1's,7's; right 2-frames in lanes ~12-16/17-21 with inners 4's,3's,6's (e.g., row 1: 2,4,4,4,2; row 16: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,6,6,6,2). Background 9 filled elsewhere.
 * Does not look fully correct: Potential overwrite in right side, e.g., row 3: 2,4,4,4,2 then 2,2,3,3,3,2 (3's inner placed adjacent but possibly overlapping 2-frame area, like train 1's 3's overwrite); row 17: 2,3,3,3,2 then 2,2,2,2,2 (possible extraneous 3's or misplaced inner). Left has clean placements, but row 13: full 9's (no object) matches expected blank, but row 0 has 2's in 12-16 over 9's (possible unneeded 2-component like train 3). Without expected, it seems to follow rules but likely has overlap/forced placement errors (e.g., wide bounding boxes spilling into middle 9's or wrong lane for original position). To fix test, improve frame=2 overlap check (add row-interval tracking like for 8's) and validate lane choice against original min_c more strictly; avoid placing tiny/spurious 2-components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected non-background components (objects), classify them by a "frame" color (most common on boundaries), and reposition these objects horizontally into specific "lanes" (columns) in a new output grid while avoiding vertical overlaps for certain types, effectively reassembling or rearranging puzzle pieces into a standardized layout. The output grid uses the background as filler, and placements follow rules based on frame values like 8 (placed in early lanes with overlap avoidance) and 2 (placed in later lanes based on original position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components must be sorted top-to-left before placement to process in reading order.
 * Frame classification: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common value among boundary cells; if no boundary (impossible in practice), fall back to most common in whole component—this is crucial for distinguishing object types like "eight_shape" (frame=8) vs. "two_shape" (frame=2).
 * Placement rules: 8-frame components go into alternating lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5) with row-range overlap checks to stack vertically without collision; if overlap in preferred lane, try the other, else force into first lane. Reset lane if a vertical gap (>1 row) occurs. 2-frame components go to fixed lanes (e.g., 12 if originally left-leaning, 17 if right) without overlap checks—simple shift.
 * Subtle elements: Boundaries must correctly detect edges (out-of-bounds or background adjacency); empty components or single-cell objects might need handling but aren't seen. Overlap checks are row-range based (min_r to max_r), not pixel-level, assuming rigid horizontal shifts preserve shape. Grid size n=22 in examples; shifts must clip if nc out of bounds (0 to n-1). Other numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are inner fillings, preserved during copy but not used for classification.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components with internal backgrounds aren't split (since connected via non-bg); frame prioritizes boundaries over interiors. Sorting by (min_r, min_c) ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Global max_r tracks stacking for 8-frames to detect gaps. No rotation or scaling—pure translation. All cells in output start as background; only copy non-bg from components.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping; preserve exact pixel values/colors. Lanes are fixed (0,5 for 8; 12/17 for 2), but may need generalization if more types. Test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 1 vs. 9) or lane needs.

(These handle 8-frame stacking with gap detection and overlap avoidance, and simple 2-frame shifting; lanes8=[0,5] hardcoded but flexible. Useful for core placement logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly solved training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for those cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., top rows 0-4 show 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 0-4 with 8-frames misplaced (e.g., row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 0-4 instead of expected 1's filler until col 17), and a 3-filled shape in rows 14-17 cols 1-3 but with wrong surrounding 8's; also row 6 has 8,6,6,6,8 but expected has 1's in cols 0-4 for that area—likely due to wrong lane choice or overlap forcing for 8-frames, and 2-frames not shifted far enough right (e.g., row 0 expected all 1's until col 17, but generated has 2's early).
 * What worked: Background detection (1 in ex3), component finding (captures shapes like 8-frames and 2-frames), boundary frame calc (correctly IDs 8 and 2), sorting, and basic shifting/copy for non-overlapping cases.
 * What didn't: Overlap avoidance for 8-frames fails in denser vertical stacking (forces to lane 0 too often, causing left-side crowding); 2-frame lane choice (12/17 based on min_c <=8) places some too left (e.g., the top 2-filled bar should be at col 17+ but appears early); no handling for other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6 shapes are copied but perhaps need different lanes); global_max_r gap reset (+1) might be too strict, missing multi-lane resets.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential and mostly correct, but boundary detection could miss if components touch edges oddly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hardcoded lanes8=[0,5] and 12/17 for 2 may need tuning per example (e.g., ex3 expects 2-shapes more right-aligned); overlap check is row-range only, which works but assumes no horizontal spills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on patterns from training example 3—background is 9 (plausible as most common), components extracted (e.g., 8-frames in left lanes 0-4, 2-frames in mid-right like cols 12-17), but placements show issues like the top 2/4-filled shape in rows 0-2 cols 12-17 is good, yet a 3-filled in rows 4-5 cols 18-20 overlaps or shifts oddly with surrounding 2's; also rows 14-18 have a 3-shape in cols 13-15 but expected (inferring from ex3) might need it right-aligned to col 17+ without early 2's in row 3 col 17.
 * Missing right-alignment for some 2-frames (e.g., row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 in cols 12-16, but a 3 in row 17 cols 6-9 seems forced left, unlike ex3's right-heavy 3's); 8-frames in rows 3-7 and 8-12 look stacked correctly in lanes 0 and 5-ish, but a 6-shape in rows 14-15 cols 1-3 might be an unclassified frame misplaced.
 * Does not match inferred expected: Test has early left crowding (e.g., row 3: 8,4,4,4,8 in cols 0-4, but ex3 pattern suggests more filler 9's until later lanes for non-8); 7-shape in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 is inner but framed wrong, possibly misclassified as 8 and shifted to lane 0. Overall, overlap logic likely failed similarly to ex3, causing left bias—needs better candidate lane selection or more lanes for 2/3-frames to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or shapes) are identified, their "frame" color (most common color on boundaries) is determined, and relevant components framed by 2 or 8 are rearranged into a new output grid by shifting them horizontally into predefined vertical lanes while preserving their internal structure and vertical positions, with the rest filled by background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); ignore it when finding components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; track min/max row/col for bounding box.
 * Frame color is the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary, use most common in whole component—subtlety: boundaries must be explicitly checked for exposure to background/edge.
 * Only process components with frame color exactly 2 or 8; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6 framed or internal) stay in place or are not moved—easy to miss: non-2/8 components like the 3's in the top-right of example 3 must remain unmoved.
 * For 8-framed components: Place in alternating narrow vertical lanes (e.g., columns 0-4 and 5-9, but code uses 0 and 5 as starts); alternate lanes per component based on vertical gaps (if new min_r > prev max_r +1, reset to first lane, else switch); check for row-overlap in lane before placing, fall back to first lane if overlap; shift horizontally so min_c aligns to lane start.
 * For 2-framed components: Place in right-side lanes (e.g., 12 or 17 based on original min_c <=8); simpler shift, no overlap check or alternating.
 * Preserve exact pixel values when shifting; out-of-bounds shifts are clipped (don't place).
 * Sorting: Process components in row-major order (sorted by min_r, then min_c) to maintain top-to-bottom, left-to-right placement order.
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed-width implicitly by component size (e.g., 5-wide for 8's); global max_r tracks for gap detection in 8-placement.
 * Easy to miss: In example 3, 8-components from left are moved to lanes 0-4/5-9, but a top 2-component is incorrectly shifted left instead of staying/going right; 3's inside 8's move with them but shouldn't if not part of frame.
 * Components may have internal colors (e.g., 3's inside 8-frame); these move with the component.
 * Grid size n=22; lanes hardcoded (0,5 for 8; 12,17 for 2)—may need generalization if n varies, but fixed here.
 * No rotation/flipping; vertical positions unchanged.

(Helpful: Correctly finds connected components, bounding boxes, and frame colors via boundary analysis; works well for identifying 2/8-framed shapes in training 1/2, but in ex3, it includes extraneous 2's that shouldn't move or misidentifies frames.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Helpful: Ensures top-to-bottom processing order, which matched ex1/2 correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training 1 and 2: full rearrangement of 8/2 components into lanes without overlaps or misplacements.
 * Failed on training 3: Generated output misplaced a top horizontal 2-component too far left (row 0 cols 5-9 instead of 17-21), and incorrectly shifted some 2/3 elements in the top 8-component area (e.g., row1: 2,3,3,3,2 in cols5-9 instead of 1's, with 2,3,3,3,2 in cols17-21); internal 3's moved with 8 but a spurious 2 appeared where it shouldn't.
 * What worked: Background detection (1), component extraction, frame ID for most 8/2 shapes, lane placement for lower components (e.g., bottom 8 with 3's and 2 with 4's placed correctly in ex3), alternating lanes for 8's without overlap.
 * What didn't: For 8-placement, the overlap check and gap-based lane switching failed for top components, causing fallback to first lane and incorrect shifts; 2-placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) misfired for a left-origined 2, placing it in lane 12 (cols12-16) but expected right; no handling for components that might already be in target lanes or partial overlaps.
 * Relevant_comps filter [c for c in components if c['frame'] in {2, 8}] worked but may have included invalid 2-frames (e.g., internal 2's not true frames).
 * place_eight_shape has good overlap check and gap logic but buggy candidate selection (tries current/other, then forces first—caused ex3 top placement error); lanes8=[0,5] assumes 1-col lanes but components are wider (0-4,5-9 implicitly).
 * place_two_shape is simple but lane choice (12 if <=8 else 17) doesn't account for component width or existing positions, leading to ex3 row0 error.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are core but place_eight_shape needs refinement for lane indexing and fallback.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (background 9 correct, some 8-components shifted to left lanes 0-4/5-9 with internals like 4's/3's preserved, 2-components to right like cols12-16/17-21) but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules and ex3 patterns.
 * Issues: Top 2 with 4's placed in cols12-16 but extends to col17 with 2's overlapping—expected cleaner right placement without spillover; a 2 with 3's in rows15-19 cols12-16 but internals shifted oddly (3's in col17-19 instead of tight); bottom 8 with 3's in row16-19 cols0-4 but 8's in col5-9 misplaced (should alternate lanes better); row3 has 8's in 0-4 but then 2,4's in 12-16 with 3's spilling to 18-20—mismatch like ex3, suggesting same lane-switching/overlap bug.
 * Upper 8 with 7's and 1's placed correctly in lanes but a spurious 2 in row12 cols0-4 shouldn't be there (likely misidentified frame); overall, test shows similar ex3 errors (misplaced left 2's, spillover), so incorrect—needs better frame validation and lane width enforcement (e.g., dx to align min_c to lane start fully).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs or objects) framed by specific numbers (like 2 or 8), where the goal is to extract these components from an input grid, identify their "frame" type based on boundary colors, and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into fixed "lanes" (columns) while preserving their internal structure and respecting overlaps or ordering. The background is the most common cell value, and components are non-background connected regions (4-directional connectivity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 1 in training example 3 expected output, 9 in test output); it fills the output grid initially, and non-background cells are only placed if they belong to valid components.
 * Components are 4-connected regions (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; isolated cells or disconnected parts are treated separately.
 * Frame identification: For each component, compute boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame is the most common value among boundary cells. If no boundary (fully internal, rare), use most common in whole component. Only components with frame==8 or frame==2 are placed; others (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) are omitted or treated as internal/non-frame.
 * Placement rules: Eight_comps (frame==8) are sorted by (min_r, min_c) and placed into lanes [0,5] (left side), using a greedy non-overlapping row-range placement, alternating lanes, resetting lane on row gaps, with fallback to lane 0 if overlap. Two_comps (frame==2) sorted similarly, placed into lanes [17,12] (right side), with lane choice based on original min_c (>8 prefers 17 first, else 12 first), again greedy non-overlap in rows.
 * Subtleties: Lanes are fixed columns (0-based indexing, n=22); shifting uses dx = lane - min_c to align left edge to lane. Only place if nc in [0,n); overlaps in rows block placement in that lane. Sorting ensures top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Internal colors (e.g., 3 inside 8-frame) must be preserved exactly. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency; components touching multiple frames might misidentify. Output must exactly match expected structure, including background fills; no rotation or scaling.
 * Other considerations: Grid size n x n (inferred 22 from lanes up to 17); no diagonal connectivity; handle empty components or no-boundary cases gracefully. From training 3, frame detection or lane choice fails for right-side 2-frames containing 3/4/5, leading to misplacement. Test case likely has background 9, with 8-frames on left/mid and 2-frames on right/bottom, but placement order or overlap logic may ignore vertical stacking rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```
(This reliably identifies background as most common value; essential and correct across attempts.)

                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This extracts components with bounds and frame correctly; uses DFS stack for connectivity; boundary logic is solid but may overcount if component touches background incorrectly; helpful for all cases.)

(The main program function integrates these, sorts/filtering by frame, initializes output with background, and calls placement; overall structure is useful but placement buggy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the latest (and only provided) attempt; it correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating good understanding of background detection, component extraction, and basic left-lane placement for 8-frames.
 * For training example 3: Generated output has incorrect background fills (e.g., row 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...2,2,2,2,2]; row 1 has [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,...2,3,3,3,2]; the top-right 2-frame with 3s is shifted left into columns 17-21 but with wrong starting row/alignment, and left 8-frames (with internal 2s and 6s) are partially misplaced or overwritten; bottom 2-frames with 3/4/5 are in correct lanes but row-overlapped or unsorted, leading to 2s where 1s expected in rows 6-7; unknown reason for 2s leaking into background areas, possibly from unfiltered components or dx miscalculation.
 * Placement for two_comps assumes min_c >8 for lane order, but in training 3, some 2-frames are mid-grid, causing fallback to wrong lane (12 instead of 17), creating overlaps; eight_comps alternate lanes well but don't reset properly on row gaps, stacking incorrectly.
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for vertical order but misses horizontal priority in lanes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's place_eight_components and place_two_components are partially helpful (greedy overlap check is good) but flawed in lane selection and fallback (always to first lane causes crowding); unhelpful for cases with >2 components per lane type.
 * Function find_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but boundary frame logic may fail if boundaries have ties (uses most_common(1), assumes no ties).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (background 9 fills correctly; 8-frames placed in left lanes 0/4? with internals like 4/7 preserved; 2-frames in right lanes ~12/17 with internals 3/4/6; vertical stacking without major overlaps), but does not look fully correct—e.g., row 0 has 2-frame with 4s starting at col 12, but extends to col 21 with 9s bleeding in; row 3 has 8-frame with 4s in cols 0-4, but adjacent 2-frame in cols 12-21 has 3s shifted down; bottom rows (16-20) have 2-frames with 3s in lane 12-17, but row 16 has 8s intruding from above, suggesting overlap bug; mid-section (rows 7-13) has isolated 8s and 1s not in expected frame structure, possibly from unfiltered components; overall, it rearranges like training but misaligns some 2-frames vertically (e.g., 6s in row 14-15 not stacked properly under 4s), so likely incorrect for test rules—needs better row-gap reset and lane-specific sorting to match expected clean lanes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent pixel colors, requiring the extraction of connected components (objects or blobs) excluding the background, identification of a "frame" color for each component based on boundary cells, and rearrangement of these components into fixed "lanes" (columns or positions) in a new output grid while preserving their internal structure and filling the rest with background. The goal is to simulate assembling puzzle pieces into a standardized layout, likely for a game or matching challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) must be extracted as blobs.
 * Components are defined by flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to find connected non-background cells; track bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for placement.
 * Frame color is determined from the most common color on the component's boundary cells (cells adjacent to background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully internal, rare), use the most common color in the whole component.
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to maintain input order.
 * Placement rules: 8-framed components go into specific lanes (e.g., columns 0 and 5, grouped by vertical adjacency into blocks and cycled across lanes); 2-framed into lanes like 12 or 17 based on original position; other frames may need different handling (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7 not fully addressed).
 * Subtlety: Lanes are fixed column offsets; shift entire component horizontally by dx = target_lane - min_c, but only place if nc in bounds (0 to n-1); vertical position stays the same as original.
 * Grouping for 8s: Vertically adjacent components (min_r <= prev_max_r +1) form "blocks" placed alternately in lanes; non-adjacent start new blocks.
 * Easy to miss: Boundaries include out-of-grid adjacencies; components with no explicit boundary might default incorrectly; 1s seem to be background in some cases but not always; test grids may have different backgrounds (e.g., 9 vs 1).
 * All other non-8/2 components (e.g., framed with 3,4,5,6) are not placed in this attempt, leading to missing elements.
 * Preserve exact shapes: Overwrite output only where placing, no rotation/scaling.
 * n=22 in examples, but generalize to any n.
 * Potential overlap: Placement might overwrite if lanes conflict, but examples avoid it.

        if 0 <= nc < n:

```
(Core placement function; shifts horizontally while keeping rows fixed; bounds-check prevents overflow; reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Component extraction, frame detection, and lane placement for 8s (lanes 0/5, grouped blocks) and 2s (lanes 12/17 based on original min_c <=8 or >8) worked perfectly, including background fill with 1s.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., row 0 has [2,2,2,2,2,1,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,2,2]; rows 1-4 have 8s and 2s/3s shifted left with extra 2s in columns 0-4 where expected has 8s and 1s; row 6 has [8,6,6,6,8,1,...] but expected has [1,1,1,1,1,8,6,...] (6s shifted right into lane 6); rows 13-21 mostly match but top has anomalies; overall, 8-block grouping failed for upper components, treating them as separate and placing in wrong lanes, and 3-framed components (e.g., the 3s in expected rows 1-4 col 18-20) not placed at all (missing in generated).
 * 2-framed placement logic (lane=12 if min_c<=8 else 17) worked in trains 1-2 but may overgeneralize; in train 3, it placed some 2s incorrectly in upper rows.
 * No handling for other frames (3,4,5,6): These are extracted but never placed, causing missing elements like the 3s,4s,5s,6s in expected train 3 (e.g., 3s in rows 15-17 cols 18-20, 4s in row 13 cols 18-20, 5s in rows 9-11 cols 13-15, 6s in rows 6-8 cols 6-8).
 * place_eights groups vertically adjacent 8-comps into blocks and cycles lanes 0/5, which succeeded in trains 1-2 but failed in train 3 by not grouping a upper block properly (placed small 8s/2s mix in cols 0-4 instead of full 8-frame in cols 0-4).
 * Background correctly 1 in trains, but placement overwrites incorrectly without preserving empty lanes fully.
 * No rotation or vertical shift; assumes original rows preserved, which matches expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It shows background 9 (plausible if most common), with 8-framed components placed in lanes 0/5 (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 has 8/4s, rows 8-12 cols 1-4 has 8/7s/1s, rows 16-20 cols 5-9 has 8/3s), 2-framed in lanes ~12-17 (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 12-16 has 2/4s, rows 13-17 cols 12-16 has 2/6s/3s), which aligns with rules; however, other frames like 1,3,4,6,7 are placed inconsistently or not at all (e.g., 7s in rows 9-11 cols 2-4 but expected likely needs them in a dedicated lane like 6-8; 1s scattered as if background but sometimes framed; 3s in row 16 col 13-15 and row 17 col 12-14 seem shifted wrong, possibly from unhandled 3-frame logic).
 * Missing elements: No clear placement for 5,6,7 frames (e.g., 6s in rows 14-16 cols 1-3 and row 16 col 12-14 look like partial 6-blobs, but expected probably groups them into lane 6 or similar); upper rows 0-2 have 2/4s in col 12-16 and 8/4s misplaced in row 3 col 0-4, suggesting 4-framed not handled (similar to train 3's missing 4s).
 * Overlaps or gaps: Rows 12-13 cols 0-4 empty-ish with 2s/8s bleeding; row 21 all 9s ok, but test likely expects fuller lanes for all frames (e.g., 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s in sequential lanes like 12,17,6, etc.); differences from expected unknown without input grid, but pattern mismatches train 3 errors (unplaced non-2/8 frames, bad grouping), so probably incorrect for similar reasons—e.g., 4s in row 0 col 13-15 and row 3 col 1-3 should be in a right-side lane, not split.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where connected components (blobs of non-background cells) are identified, classified by a "frame" color (most common color on their boundary adjacent to background or grid edges), and rearranged into a standardized output grid. Components framed in 8 are placed in two left-side lanes (columns 0 and 5) with vertical non-overlap and alternating placement, while components framed in 2 are placed in right-side lanes (around columns 12 or 17) based on their original horizontal position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Components must be extracted fully, including their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) for positioning.
 * Frame determination: For each component, identify boundary cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); frame is the most common color among boundary cells. If no boundary (rare, internal component), use most common color in the whole component. This is crucial for classifying as 8-framed or 2-framed.
 * Placement rules: Sort components by top-left position (min_r, min_c). For 8-framed: Use two lanes (cols 0 and 5); place in a lane without vertical row overlap with existing placements in that lane; alternate lanes per "group" separated by row gaps; if no fit, force into lane 0. For 2-framed: Place left-leaning (min_c <=8) in col 12 lane, right-leaning in col 17 lane, shifting horizontally to align min_c.
 * Subtleties: Components may touch edges, so boundaries include out-of-bounds checks. Overlap avoidance is only vertical per lane (not horizontal across lanes). Gaps in rows (max_r +1 < next min_r) reset lane alternation. Output initializes to background; placements overwrite without merging or rotation. Colors like 1,3,4,5,6,7 are inner fills, not frames. Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check all 4 directions per cell; components can be irregular shapes (e.g., L-shapes or with holes? but code assumes no holes in connectivity).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within component. Grid size n=22 fixed? (from outputs). Ensure placements stay within bounds (code checks nc < n).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This is core and helpful: Extracts components with bounding boxes and frames correctly; uses DFS for connectivity and boundary detection.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering placements by original top-left position.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for shifting and placing without rotation; bounds-checked.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identified background (1 in example 3), extracted components, computed frames (8 and 2), and separated/sorted them, which worked for training 1 and 2.
 * Placement logic for 8-framed components in lanes 0/5 with vertical overlap avoidance and alternation worked for training 1/2 but failed in 3: Generated misplaced a 3-filled component (originally right-side) into left lanes, and top rows had incorrect 2/3 placements (e.g., row 1 generated [2,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected all 1's except right; row 2 had 8,2,2,2,8 but shifted wrong).
 * For 2-framed: Placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8, but in example 3, this put a left-leaning 3-component (frame 2?) too far left, overlapping or misaligning with expected right-side 3's in cols 18-20.
 * Boundary/frame detection worked (e.g., 8-frames for boxes around 2/3/4/5/6 fills), but subtle issue: Some components' boundaries might include inner colors if not purely edged, leading to wrong frame (unknown if this caused example 3 failure).
 * Lane alternation reset on row gaps is good but in example 3, global_max_r tracking may have failed to group properly, causing overflow to lane 0 prematurely.
 * No merging of components; assumes disjoint, which held.
 * Overall, core extraction and simple placements succeeded in 2/3 cases, but complex interleaving/overlap in denser grids (example 3) broke.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on inferred rules: Background seems 9 (common), with 8-framed components (e.g., boxes around 4's,7's,3's,6's) placed in left lanes 0/5-ish, but some shifts are off (e.g., row 3 has 8,4,4,4,8 starting col 0, good; but row 15 has 2,6,6,6,2 in col 0 lane, which should be 8-framed if boxed). 2-framed placements on right (e.g., 4's in cols 13-15, 3's in 14-16) seem aligned to 12/17, but row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 in col 12 with trailing 2's extending to col 21, which matches no-overwrite but may clip or misalign if original min_c >8. Top rows have 2's misplaced (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but expected might have cleaner 9's). Inner fills (1,3,4,5,6,7) preserved, but a 1-component in rows 8-11 cols 6-8 seems unplaced or merged wrong (appears in lane 5?). Overall, it partially matches rules (lanes used, no overlaps), but likely wrong frames or sorting caused extra 2's on left and missing some 8-boxes on right; doesn't fully make sense without input grid, but differences suggest placement order bug for mixed frames.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the goal is to identify connected "components" (non-background blobs or objects), classify them by a "frame" value (e.g., based on boundary colors), and rearrange them into a standardized output grid by placing them into specific horizontal "lanes" while preserving their internal structure and avoiding overlaps. The output grid maintains the same size and background value, effectively sorting and positioning objects like in a puzzle assembly or inventory layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid; all non-background connected components (4-directional adjacency) must be extracted as blobs, ignoring isolated pixels or background.
 * Components are classified by "frame": the most common value on the boundary pixels (those touching background or grid edge); if no boundary (fully enclosed, rare), use the most common internal value. Frames like 8 or 2 seem to denote object types (e.g., 8 for framed boxes, 2 for simpler shapes).
 * Sorting components by top-left position (min_r, min_c) before placement to process in reading order.
 * Placement uses fixed lanes: for frame=8 components, lanes at columns 0 and 5 with overlap avoidance based on row ranges (min_r to max_r); alternate lanes per "group" of vertically stacked components, resetting lane choice if a gap in rows (>1). For frame=2, lanes at 12 (leftish) or 17 (rightish) based on original min_c (<=8 or >8).
 * Subtleties: Boundary detection must strictly check adjacency to background/edge; enclosed components fallback to internal mode. Overlap check for lanes considers vertical row spans only (ignores horizontal, assuming fixed lane width fits). Components may shift horizontally (dx = lane - min_c) but rows stay fixed (no vertical shifting). Preserve exact pixel values when placing.
 * Potential misses: Assumes only frames 2 and 8; other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7) in grids are internals, not frames—may need handling if they appear as frames. Lanes are hardcoded and may not scale; test grids have n=22, but logic assumes this. No rotation or scaling of components. Gaps between components (e.g., row skips) trigger lane reset for stacking. Background fills unoccupied cells.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components touching multiple frames or irregular shapes; boundary counter only on perimeter, not full component. If no boundary pixels, fallback may misclassify. Placement can clip if dx pushes outside bounds (code checks 0<=nc<n but still places if yes—potential partial clip). Sorting is stable by position, but ties may affect order.

    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple but effective for processing order; helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly identified background (1), extracted components, classified frames (e.g., 8 and 2), placed 8-frame in lanes 0/5 without overlap, 2-frame in 12/17, resulting in exact match.
 * Failed for training 3: Generated top rows (0-4) misplaced a 2/3 shape on left (e.g., row0 all 2's then 1's; row1-4 has 3's framed by 2's on left, 8's with 2's on right), while expected has 1's background on top row, then right-side 8-frame with internal 2's and 3's starting row1. Also, 6-shape in rows7-9 generated with 8-frame on left but expected shifted right (under 1's in cols0-4, 8-frame cols5-9); unknown why lanes misassigned or order wrong—possibly frame misclassification for top components (3's boundary as 2 vs expected 8?) or sorting/placement not respecting vertical groups.
 * place_component and place_two_components are helpful but hardcoded lanes (12/17) worked for trains 1-2; in train3, two_comps placement correct for bottom but top misplacement suggests eight_comps logic failed (e.g., overlaps not detected, lane alternation wrong).
 * place_eight_components is partially helpful (overlap avoidance via row spans) but buggy: In train3, it stacked 6's too high/early (row6-9 vs expected row6-8 under 1's), and top 8/2/3 not isolated to right lane; global_max_r reset logic may fail on multi-group stacks, forcing default lane0. Doesn't handle left-shifted 1's prefix in expected rows6-8/10-12.
 * Overall, component extraction works (blobs intact), but classification/placement fails when components have irregular frames (e.g., 3-internal as non-8) or vertical spacing triggers wrong lane choice.
 * No unhelpful functions; all build toward solution, but lane hardcoding limits generality (e.g., test has bg=9, different lanes?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct or consistent with puzzle rules; it has irregular placements (e.g., top rows0-3 mix 9-bg, 2/4 on right col12-17, but 8/4 frame on left col0-4 row3-7 overlaps vertically without clear lane separation; row3 has 8's on left then 2/4 on right, but internals like 3's in row5-6 col17-20 shifted oddly).
 * Missing expected structure: Expected likely mirrors train3 pattern—background 9 fills most, with 8-frames in lanes ~0/5 for boxed shapes (e.g., 4's,6's,7's,3's internals), 2-frames in ~12/17; but generated places 2/4 early on right (rows0-2 col12-17), then 8/4 left (rows3-7 col0-4), 8/7 mid-left (rows8-11 col1-4? with 1's internal?), 2/6 mid (rows14-17 col0-4 and col12-16?), bottom 8/3 right-misplaced. This suggests overlap or lane mischoice (e.g., 8-comps not alternating properly, treating spaced groups as one).
 * Does not make sense: Clipping or out-of-bounds? No, but e.g., row12 all 8's/9's but no internals; bottom row18-21 has 8/3 in col5-9 but expected probably stacked cleaner. Differs from train3 failure (misplaced top) by having more left-right mixing; likely same root cause (frame=8 over/under-placement). To fix, refine lane alternation for gaps and classify non-8/2 frames (e.g., if boundary=2 but internal=3, still place as 2-lane?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the task is to identify and extract connected components (blobs or "panels") framed by specific colors (e.g., 8 or 2), determine the background as the most frequent color, and rearrange these components into a new grid layout using predefined "lanes" or column alignments to avoid overlaps, simulating a reorganized comic strip or panel arrangement. The rearrangement preserves the relative shapes and internal colors of components but shifts them horizontally based on frame type and original position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the grid (e.g., 1 or 9); all non-background connected components (4-directional connectivity) are extracted as potential panels.
 * Components must exclude background; use flood-fill (DFS or BFS via stack) to find them, tracking bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for placement.
 * Frame color determination: For each component, identify boundary pixels (those adjacent to background or grid edge via 4 directions); frame is the most common color among boundary pixels. If no boundary (rare, fully internal), fall back to most common color in the entire component—this is a subtlety that might not trigger often but ensures robustness.
 * Sorting components by (min_r, min_c) to process in top-left to bottom-right order, which influences placement sequence and lane alternation.
 * Placement logic separates by frame: Frame=8 components go to left "lanes" (e.g., starting columns 0 and 5), alternating lanes per "row group" (if current min_r > previous max_r +1, reset to lane 0; else alternate) to stack vertically without overlap; check for row-range overlaps in a lane before placing, fallback to other lane, then force to lane 0 if needed. Frame=2 components go to right lanes (e.g., 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17), placed directly without alternation.
 * Subtle overlap avoidance: When placing, compute dx = target_lane - original_min_c to shift horizontally; only place if new columns fit (0 to n-1), but code doesn't clip—potential issue if dx causes out-of-bounds. Preserve all internal colors; output initializes to background.
 * Easy to miss: Boundary detection must check both out-of-bounds and background adjacency; components might touch edges, so frame could include edge-touching colors. Lanes are fixed (hardcoded), assuming n=22; alternation is per vertical "block" based on row gaps, not strict rows.
 * Components with other frames (e.g., 3,4,5,6) are ignored in placement (only 8 and 2 handled), which worked for training 1-2 but may discard key elements in 3.
 * Grid size n x n (e.g., 22); outputs are flattened rows for comparison, but preserve 2D structure.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background as most frequent color; essential and working across attempts.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts components with bounding boxes and frame detection; core and mostly working, but boundary/frame logic may misclassify in complex shapes.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Simple sort by position; helpful for sequential placement.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Basic placement shifter; useful but lacks clipping for out-of-bounds, which could silently drop pixels.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt; successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 by correctly extracting and placing frame=8 and frame=2 components without overlaps, preserving shapes and internals.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output misplaced a top-left frame=8 component with internal 2's and 3's shifted left into columns 5-9 (e.g., row 0 has 2's in 5-9, row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in 5-9), while expected shifts it right to columns 17-21 (e.g., row 0 all 1's until 17-21 with 2's, row 1 has 2,3,3,3,2 in 17-21); this suggests lane alternation or starting column logic failed for the first component, treating it as already in a "continued" block instead of resetting.
 * What worked: Component extraction, frame detection (identified 8 and 2 correctly), sorting, and basic placement without corruption; lower sections (e.g., rows 6-21) match expected closely, including the 6's, 5's, and bottom 4's/3's.
 * What didn't: Lane assignment for eight_comps—code's global_max_r reset logic didn't trigger properly for the top component (min_r=0), leading to placement in lane 0 (dx=0 - min_c, assuming min_c=0) instead of a right-side or adjusted lane; also, two_comps placement seems correct but overshadowed by eight_comps error. Overlap check in place_eight_components alternates but forces to lane 0 if both fail, which may have caused crowding on left.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this iteration demonstrates partial understanding: Core extraction works, but placement heuristics (alternation based on row gaps) are brittle for varying layouts.
 * Function `place_eight_components` is helpful but flawed—its overlap detection uses row ranges but assumes vertical stacking; the fallback to lane 0 overrides alternation, causing left-bias in dense cases like training 3.
 * Function `place_two_components` is simple and worked (placed in 12/17 based on min_c <=8), but hardcoded lanes assume specific grid width/original positions.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though frame detection could be refined for multi-color boundaries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming bg=9) partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It extracts and places components similarly (e.g., frame=8 blocks with internals like 4's/3's on leftish lanes, frame=2 with 4's/6's/3's on right), preserving shapes, but shows potential misplacements like the top 2's/4's block in columns 12-16 (row 0: 2's in 12-16, but extends to 21 with extras), and a misplaced 3's in row 3 columns 19-21 overlapping what seems like a separate component; compared to training 3 error, it likely suffers from the same left-bias in eight_comps placement (e.g., 8's with 4's starting in col 0-4, but internals bleeding into col 7+ without proper shift).
 * Issues: Row 3 has 2's in 12-16 then 2,3,3,3,2 in 17-21, suggesting two components merged or overlapped incorrectly; bottom sections (e.g., rows 14-20 with 6's/3's in lanes ~0-4 and 12-16) look aligned but the 8's in row 16 col 5-9 indicate failed alternation, placing in lane 5 instead of alternating properly. Without input grid, can't confirm exact expected, but it doesn't match the clean lane separation in expected training 3 (e.g., no bleed-over in right lanes). This reinforces that placement logic needs better reset for new vertical blocks and stricter overlap rejection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:35:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored pixels, where the task is to identify non-background connected components (objects) that are "framed" by specific colors (2 or 8), extract and rearrange these objects into a new output grid by placing them in predefined vertical "lanes" based on the frame color and their original positions, while filling the rest with the background color. The goal is to standardize the layout, likely simulating sorting or organizing puzzle pieces into lanes without overlapping or distorting their internal shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent number in the grid (e.g., 1 in training examples, 9 in test); everything else is potential foreground.
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; diagonal doesn't count.
 * For each component, identify "boundary" cells (those adjacent to background or grid edge); the frame color is the most common number on these boundary cells—if no boundary (rare, fully internal), fall back to most common in the whole component.
 * Only process components where frame is exactly 2 or 8; ignore others (e.g., components framed by 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are discarded).
 * Sort relevant components by top-left position (min_r, then min_c) for sequential placement.
 * Placement rules: Output starts as all-background grid. For frame=8 components, place in alternating lanes (columns starting at 0 and 5), switching lanes only if there's a row gap (>1 row since last max_r); track global max_r for 8's to detect gaps. For frame=2 components, place in lane 12 if original min_c <=8 (left side), else lane 17 (right side); no alternating or gap logic for 2's.
 * When placing, shift horizontally by dx = target_lane - original_min_c, but only copy cells within bounds (0 to n-1); vertical positions stay the same (no row shifting).
 * Subtleties: Components may touch or be adjacent but are separate if not connected; boundary detection must check all 4 directions for edge/background adjacency. Frame determination can fail if boundary has mixed colors—most_common(1) picks the dominant one, but ties aren't handled (assumes no ties). Lanes are fixed and narrow, so large components may clip if dx pushes them out of bounds (code clips by checking 0 <= nc < n). No rotation, scaling, or internal modification—preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within component. Easy to miss: 8's alternate lanes per "group" separated by row gaps, but 2's are strictly left/right based on original column. Background fill must be uniform. Components might overlap in output if lanes conflict, but rules aim to avoid this via sorting and lanes.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Gap detection for 8's uses minr > global_max_r8 +1, which assumes vertical stacking but may misgroup if components are horizontally offset. No handling for components spanning multiple lanes originally. Test grid has bg=9, different frames possible (e.g., 2,3,4,6,7,8), so generalization needed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    count = Counter()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            count[g[i][j]] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies background as the mode; useful for init.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int, n: int) -> List[Dict]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    component.append((r, c))
                    min_r = min(min_r, r)
                    max_r = max(max_r, r)
                    min_c = min(min_c, c)
                    max_c = max(max_c, c)
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                boundary = set()
                for r, c in component:
                    is_boundary = False
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if not (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n) or g[nr][nc] == background:
                            is_boundary = True
                            break
                    if is_boundary:
                        boundary.add((r, c))
                if boundary:
                    bound_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in boundary)
                    frame = bound_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                else:
                    all_count = Counter(g[r][c] for r, c in component)
                    frame = all_count.most_common(1)[0][0]
                comp_dict = {
                    'component': component,
                    'min_r': min_r,
                    'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c,
                    'max_c': max_c,
                    'frame': frame
                }
                components.append(comp_dict)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: DFS-based component extraction with bounding box and frame detection via boundary; handles empty boundary fallback. Essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))
```
(Useful for ordering placement top-to-left.)

```python
def place_component(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, dx: int, n: int) -> None:
    for r, c in comp['component']:
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nc < n:
            out[r][nc] = g[r][c]
```
(Helpful for non-destructive placement with clipping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training 1 and 2, demonstrating solid component detection, frame identification (2/8 filtering), sorting, and basic lane placement (e.g., 8's in 0/5 alternating, 2's in 12/17 based on side).
 * Failed training 3: Generated output misplaced several components—e.g., a top-left 3-framed object (rows 1-4, cols 1-3) was placed in lane 0 as [2,3,3,3,2,...] instead of being ignored (expected ignores it, placing 8's there); a small 2/3 object in expected rows 1-4 cols 17-21 is shifted wrong in generated (appears as 8's overlapping); row 0 in generated is all 2's early then 1's, but expected has 1's with late 2's; a 6-object in rows 6-8 is placed correctly but surrounding 1's/8's mismatch; overall, 8-components in rows 14-20 are correct, but upper half has swapped/misplaced 2/8/3 elements (unknown why 3's leaked in despite frame filter—possibly boundary misdetection on mixed objects).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_components serves as essential equivalent for pulling framed objects.
 * Lane alternation for 8's worked in trains 1/2 but failed in 3 due to gap detection: code switches lanes on minr > global_max_r8 +1, but in 3, a vertical gap was misread, causing non-alternating placement (e.g., consecutive 8's in same lane, overlapping or shifting 2's wrong).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though frame detection could be broken for components with tie boundaries (uses most_common(1), assumes dominance).
 * Consider problems where components have internal background holes (code treats as separate components, but boundary might undercount frame if hole mimics edge).
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (e.g., a 2/3 shape in expected rows 1-4 cols 17-21 appears distorted in generated as part of 8's in cols 5-9; possibly wrong dx calc or including non-framed cells).

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the same logic as the attempt but does not look fully correct based on inferred rules—e.g., it places a 4-object (rows 3-6, cols 12-16 in output) which should be ignored (frame likely 4, not 2/8), leaking non-relevant content; a 3-object in rows 16-19 cols 13-16 is placed but expected rules would discard it; 8-components (e.g., rows 3-7 cols 0-4 and rows 7-11 cols 0-4) alternate lanes correctly (0 then 5? Wait, output shows 8's in 0-4 for row3, then row7 in 0-4 again—gap detection failed, should switch to 5); 2-components like rows 0-2 cols 12-16 (4's inside) and rows 13-19 cols 12-16 (3's/6's) are placed in lane 12/17 appropriately but include ignored inners (e.g., 3/4/6 not framed by 2/8); bg=9 filled correctly, but upper rows 0-2 have extra 2's/4's in cols 12-21 that seem like left-side placement but distort original shapes (e.g., row2 has [2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] bleeding); lower 2/3/6 in rows 15-19 cols 12-16 mismatches expected purity (should only copy framed pixels, but extras appear); overall, it makes partial sense (structure preserved) but violates filtering (non-2/8 frames included) and alternation (no lane switch on row gap ~row12-13), likely failing like train3—account for stricter frame validation and better gap logic to handle test.
