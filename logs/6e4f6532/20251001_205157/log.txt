=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:51:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def extract_columns(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Extract columns from the grid."""
    if not g:
        return []
    height = len(g)
    width = len(g[0])
    return [[g[i][j] for i in range(height)] for j in range(width)]

def apply_gravity(col: List[int], empty: int = 0) -> List[int]:
    """Apply gravity to a column: move non-empty values to the bottom."""
    non_empty = [x for x in col if x != empty]
    num_empty = len(col) - len(non_empty)
    return [empty] * num_empty + non_empty

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:58:56] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a falling blocks or gravity-based puzzle (similar to games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Puyo Puyo) where numbered blocks (representing colors or types) fall downward under gravity within a grid, but with rules that likely involve connected groups of the same number falling as units, potential matching/removal of adjacent same-number blocks, and rebuilding the grid after falls. The goal is to simulate one step of falling and settling, resulting in a new grid configuration.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks fall downward (toward higher row indices, assuming row 0 is top) but only until they hit another block or the bottom; independent per-cell falling doesn't work, as seen in mismatches where groups shift together.
 * Connected components of the same number likely fall as rigid units if adjacent (horizontally or vertically), preserving their shape during descent, rather than per-column independent movement—this explains why simple column gravity scrambles group positions in expected outputs.
 * No explicit empty cells (0s) are visible in inputs/outputs; all cells seem filled with numbers (1-9), so "empty" might be implicit or handled differently (e.g., gaps created by falling but not shown, or the grid is always dense).
 * Matching rules may apply: adjacent (3+ in a row/column) same numbers might disappear before or after falling, creating space for further drops, but this isn't simulated in the attempt—subtle because outputs show rearranged but not removed blocks.
 * Grid is represented as List[List[int]] with rows as outer lists; falling affects vertical positions but may involve horizontal stability for connected blobs.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s in train 1/2) seem fixed or "floor" layers that don't move, suggesting gravity only applies above certain stable bases.
 * Subtle: Rotations, merges, or color-specific behaviors (e.g., 5s as background?) might occur, but easy to miss without full rules; outputs show specific repositions like 8s/9s clustering differently.
 * All attempts must preserve grid dimensions and number distributions—no creation/destruction except possibly via matches.
 * Consider iterative falling: blocks may need multiple passes until stable, as single-pass column gravity leaves floating groups in generated vs. expected.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple per-column gravity, which worked for basic downward movement in isolated columns (e.g., stacking non-empties at bottom) but failed to handle connected groups across columns, leading to scrambled positions.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps many 5s static and drops 8s/9s/2s/1s/4s incorrectly per column (e.g., row 3 has 9 in col 18 generated vs. expected 8s cluster in cols 17-20; row 5 has 8s/9s/4/2 misplaced vs. expected 8s/9s/2s in specific blob shapes); unknown why blobs don't preserve shape, but likely because no component detection.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated drops 8s/9s/2s/4s/3s per column, creating floating or misaligned groups (e.g., row 11 has 8s/9s scattered vs. expected clustered 2s/9s in cols 17-20 and 8s below; row 18 has 9 in col 6 generated vs. expected 8s/7s cluster; bottom 3s intact but upper layers wrong); simple gravity ignores horizontal connections.
 * extract_columns and build_grid are helpful for column-wise ops but broken for this puzzle as they enable only independent falls, not group-aware simulation (still useful as building blocks).
 * apply_gravity is unhelpful/broken: Assumes empty=0 (but no 0s in grids), moves all non-empties to bottom per column without checking connections or stability, causing over-dropping and loss of structure (don't use in future without mods for groups).
 * No detection of matches/removals, missing potential disappearances that create fall space.
 * Core issue: Treats grid as independent columns instead of holistic structure with blobs; this partially understands vertical falling (some bottom stacking matches) but misses horizontal adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies simplistic per-column stacking (e.g., all 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s/2s/1s dropped to bottoms of their columns, creating dense lower layers with floating mismatches like isolated 9s/8s in upper rows), but ignores connected groups—e.g., clusters of 8s/9s in cols 4-6 and 20-23 should likely fall as units preserving shapes, not scatter vertically per column (generated has 8s split across rows 3-11 in col 4 vs. expected probable tight drop to row 5-7 or similar). This results in unnatural fragmentation (e.g., row 6 has scattered 3/8/7 vs. expected consolidated blobs) and doesn't account for potential matches (e.g., multiple adjacent 7s might clear). Without expected, it visually resembles over-simplified Tetris drops but fails training logic, so likely wrong; needs group detection to handle test's complex 7/8/9 clusters.

[2025-10-01 20:58:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 21:07:25] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:07:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, likely representing a "canvas" or image that needs to be vertically flipped or reversed between uniform border rows (top and bottom), while preserving those borders, to match evolving patterns across multiple frames or examples. The goal is to process a sequence of grids (as a list of rows) and output the transformed version that aligns with expected visual changes, such as correcting orientations or symmetries in drawn objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify uniform rows (all elements identical) at the top and bottom as fixed borders that should not be altered or included in any reversal.
 * The "canvas" is the non-uniform middle section between borders; it must be reversed vertically (i.e., flip the order of rows in this section) to correct the orientation, but only if it matches the puzzle's visual logic—subtly, not all middle rows may need full reversal if they contain partial patterns or evolving elements.
 * Patterns in the middle often represent "objects" or shapes (e.g., sequences of 8s forming a blob or line, 9s as highlights, or mixed numbers like 1,2 for structures) that evolve across rows; reversal should preserve their internal structure but flip their vertical position to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Uniformity check must be strict (empty rows are uniform, but grids are non-empty); borders may vary in thickness (multiple consecutive uniform rows); reversal applies only to the canvas, but if borders are misidentified (e.g., a nearly uniform row with one outlier is not uniform), the canvas slice is wrong, leading to partial reversals or unchanged rows.
 * Across examples, top borders are often solid (e.g., all 1s or 5s), bottom are solid (e.g., all 2s or 3s), and canvas has asymmetric patterns that need flipping to symmetrize or correct (e.g., in training 1, row 3 expected has 8s ending with 2, suggesting a shape adjustment post-reversal).
 * Easy to miss: Reversal is row-order flip, not element-level; some rows in canvas may appear uniform after reversal but weren't before; evolving frames mean the program must handle varying border sizes and non-symmetric objects; test grids have wider dimensions (28 columns vs 26 in training), so code must be dimension-agnostic.
 * Considerations from attempts: Over-reversing includes border rows if uniformity is mischecked; under-reversing leaves canvas intact when it should flip; objects like 8-clusters or 9-dots may need extraction to verify post-reversal shapes, but simple reversal alone fails if borders shift per row.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)
```
(This function correctly identifies uniform rows for border detection; it's reliable and should be reused.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```
(This is the core program from the attempt; it correctly slices and reverses the canvas but fails on border precision and full pattern matching—helpful as a base but needs refinement for object-aware reversal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and skips multi-row uniform borders (e.g., in training 1, it skips top all-1s/5s and bottom all-2s correctly in many rows), preserving them unchanged, which matches expected outputs where borders stay static.
 * Reversal of the canvas works partially for simple cases (e.g., in training 1 rows 1-2 and 10-13, generated matches expected all-5s/1s with 4,4 inserts), but fails when canvas contains asymmetric objects: e.g., training 1 row 3 generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,9,9,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,2,2]—generated has 8,9,9,8 (wrong shape, extra 9s, no 2 inserts) instead of solid 8s with 2s, suggesting reversal didn't align the blob correctly or mis-sliced canvas.
 * In training 1 row 4, generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2]—minor mismatch in canvas reversal (e.g., 4 placement wrong, 9 not flipped properly), indicating border detection skipped too few rows or reversal order is off for evolving patterns.
 * Training 1 row 5 generated has scattered 2s and 8s not matching expected clustered 8s with 2s; row 6 has 1s and 8s misplaced vs expected 1,8,8,9 cluster—unknown why reversal creates these outliers, possibly because canvas includes semi-uniform rows.
 * Training 2 shows similar issues: borders (top all-2s, bottom all-3s, side 4,4 and 7,7) preserved well, but canvas reversal fails badly—e.g., row 11 generated [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7] vs expected [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1,7,7], where generated inserts wrong 4s instead of flipping to include 2,9 pattern; row 14 generated has scattered 8s/9s/3 not matching expected 8-clusters.
 * Overall, attempt understands border uniformity (worked for static parts) but not canvas object evolution (didn't work: reversal misaligns shapes like 8-blobs or 9-dots, leading to extra/missing numbers); no object extraction attempted, which might help verify shapes post-reversal.
 * Function `is_uniform` is helpful and correct; the slicing logic in `program` is mostly sound but broken for variable canvas content (e.g., doesn't handle intra-row patterns or why some rows stay unchanged when they should flip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate puzzle understanding, as it mostly preserves or partially reverses the canvas but mangles object patterns similarly to training failures—e.g., rows 6-7 have scattered 9s in 7-clusters ([1,1,7,7,7,9,7,...] vs likely expected solid 7s with flipped 9-position for symmetry), and row 20 has [...,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,3,3] which introduces misplaced 2s not aligning with any clear flipped shape (expected might cluster 2s/8s/9s vertically from input patterns like row 12's 9s).
 * Lower rows (e.g., 24-28) show chaotic mixes like [1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,...] and [1,1,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,...] vs input's more structured 7s/2s/3s—reversal seems to flip but not correct orientations (e.g., 8,9 clusters appear fragmented, missing expected merges or border integrations like training's 2-inserts); overall, it looks like incomplete flipping without object awareness, so borders (top all-4s, bottom all-3s?) are handled but canvas shapes (7-blobs, 2/8/9 elements) are distorted, not making visual sense as a corrected image.

[2025-10-01 21:07:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a falling blocks or gravity-based puzzle (similar to games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Puyo Puyo) where numbered blocks (representing colors or types) fall downward under gravity within a grid, but with rules that likely involve connected groups of the same number falling as units, potential matching/removal of adjacent same-number blocks, and rebuilding the grid after falls. The goal is to simulate one step of falling and settling, resulting in a new grid configuration.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks fall downward (toward higher row indices, assuming row 0 is top) but only until they hit another block or the bottom; independent per-cell falling doesn't work, as seen in mismatches where groups shift together.
 * Connected components of the same number likely fall as rigid units if adjacent (horizontally or vertically), preserving their shape during descent, rather than per-column independent movement—this explains why simple column gravity scrambles group positions in expected outputs.
 * No explicit empty cells (0s) are visible in inputs/outputs; all cells seem filled with numbers (1-9), so "empty" might be implicit or handled differently (e.g., gaps created by falling but not shown, or the grid is always dense).
 * Matching rules may apply: adjacent (3+ in a row/column) same numbers might disappear before or after falling, creating space for further drops, but this isn't simulated in the attempt—subtle because outputs show rearranged but not removed blocks.
 * Grid is represented as List[List[int]] with rows as outer lists; falling affects vertical positions but may involve horizontal stability for connected blobs.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s in train 1/2) seem fixed or "floor" layers that don't move, suggesting gravity only applies above certain stable bases.
 * Subtle: Rotations, merges, or color-specific behaviors (e.g., 5s as background?) might occur, but easy to miss without full rules; outputs show specific repositions like 8s/9s clustering differently.
 * All attempts must preserve grid dimensions and number distributions—no creation/destruction except possibly via matches.
 * Consider iterative falling: blocks may need multiple passes until stable, as single-pass column gravity leaves floating groups in generated vs. expected.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple per-column gravity, which worked for basic downward movement in isolated columns (e.g., stacking non-empties at bottom) but failed to handle connected groups across columns, leading to scrambled positions.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps many 5s static and drops 8s/9s/2s/1s/4s incorrectly per column (e.g., row 3 has 9 in col 18 generated vs. expected 8s cluster in cols 17-20; row 5 has 8s/9s/4/2 misplaced vs. expected 8s/9s/2s in specific blob shapes); unknown why blobs don't preserve shape, but likely because no component detection.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated drops 8s/9s/2s/4s/3s per column, creating floating or misaligned groups (e.g., row 11 has 8s/9s scattered vs. expected clustered 2s/9s in cols 17-20 and 8s below; row 18 has 9 in col 6 generated vs. expected 8s/7s cluster; bottom 3s intact but upper layers wrong); simple gravity ignores horizontal connections.
 * extract_columns and build_grid are helpful for column-wise ops but broken for this puzzle as they enable only independent falls, not group-aware simulation (still useful as building blocks).
 * apply_gravity is unhelpful/broken: Assumes empty=0 (but no 0s in grids), moves all non-empties to bottom per column without checking connections or stability, causing over-dropping and loss of structure (don't use in future without mods for groups).
 * No detection of matches/removals, missing potential disappearances that create fall space.
 * Core issue: Treats grid as independent columns instead of holistic structure with blobs; this partially understands vertical falling (some bottom stacking matches) but misses horizontal adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies simplistic per-column stacking (e.g., all 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s/2s/1s dropped to bottoms of their columns, creating dense lower layers with floating mismatches like isolated 9s/8s in upper rows), but ignores connected groups—e.g., clusters of 8s/9s in cols 4-6 and 20-23 should likely fall as units preserving shapes, not scatter vertically per column (generated has 8s split across rows 3-11 in col 4 vs. expected probable tight drop to row 5-7 or similar). This results in unnatural fragmentation (e.g., row 6 has scattered 3/8/7 vs. expected consolidated blobs) and doesn't account for potential matches (e.g., multiple adjacent 7s might clear). Without expected, it visually resembles over-simplified Tetris drops but fails training logic, so likely wrong; needs group detection to handle test's complex 7/8/9 clusters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, likely representing a "canvas" or image that needs to be vertically flipped or reversed between uniform border rows (top and bottom), while preserving those borders, to match evolving patterns across multiple frames or examples. The goal is to process a sequence of grids (as a list of rows) and output the transformed version that aligns with expected visual changes, such as correcting orientations or symmetries in drawn objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify uniform rows (all elements identical) at the top and bottom as fixed borders that should not be altered or included in any reversal.
 * The "canvas" is the non-uniform middle section between borders; it must be reversed vertically (i.e., flip the order of rows in this section) to correct the orientation, but only if it matches the puzzle's visual logic—subtly, not all middle rows may need full reversal if they contain partial patterns or evolving elements.
 * Patterns in the middle often represent "objects" or shapes (e.g., sequences of 8s forming a blob or line, 9s as highlights, or mixed numbers like 1,2 for structures) that evolve across rows; reversal should preserve their internal structure but flip their vertical position to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Uniformity check must be strict (empty rows are uniform, but grids are non-empty); borders may vary in thickness (multiple consecutive uniform rows); reversal applies only to the canvas, but if borders are misidentified (e.g., a nearly uniform row with one outlier is not uniform), the canvas slice is wrong, leading to partial reversals or unchanged rows.
 * Across examples, top borders are often solid (e.g., all 1s or 5s), bottom are solid (e.g., all 2s or 3s), and canvas has asymmetric patterns that need flipping to symmetrize or correct (e.g., in training 1, row 3 expected has 8s ending with 2, suggesting a shape adjustment post-reversal).
 * Easy to miss: Reversal is row-order flip, not element-level; some rows in canvas may appear uniform after reversal but weren't before; evolving frames mean the program must handle varying border sizes and non-symmetric objects; test grids have wider dimensions (28 columns vs 26 in training), so code must be dimension-agnostic.
 * Considerations from attempts: Over-reversing includes border rows if uniformity is mischecked; under-reversing leaves canvas intact when it should flip; objects like 8-clusters or 9-dots may need extraction to verify post-reversal shapes, but simple reversal alone fails if borders shift per row.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)
```
(This function correctly identifies uniform rows for border detection; it's reliable and should be reused.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```
(This is the core program from the attempt; it correctly slices and reverses the canvas but fails on border precision and full pattern matching—helpful as a base but needs refinement for object-aware reversal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and skips multi-row uniform borders (e.g., in training 1, it skips top all-1s/5s and bottom all-2s correctly in many rows), preserving them unchanged, which matches expected outputs where borders stay static.
 * Reversal of the canvas works partially for simple cases (e.g., in training 1 rows 1-2 and 10-13, generated matches expected all-5s/1s with 4,4 inserts), but fails when canvas contains asymmetric objects: e.g., training 1 row 3 generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,9,9,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,2,2]—generated has 8,9,9,8 (wrong shape, extra 9s, no 2 inserts) instead of solid 8s with 2s, suggesting reversal didn't align the blob correctly or mis-sliced canvas.
 * In training 1 row 4, generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2]—minor mismatch in canvas reversal (e.g., 4 placement wrong, 9 not flipped properly), indicating border detection skipped too few rows or reversal order is off for evolving patterns.
 * Training 1 row 5 generated has scattered 2s and 8s not matching expected clustered 8s with 2s; row 6 has 1s and 8s misplaced vs expected 1,8,8,9 cluster—unknown why reversal creates these outliers, possibly because canvas includes semi-uniform rows.
 * Training 2 shows similar issues: borders (top all-2s, bottom all-3s, side 4,4 and 7,7) preserved well, but canvas reversal fails badly—e.g., row 11 generated [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7] vs expected [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1,7,7], where generated inserts wrong 4s instead of flipping to include 2,9 pattern; row 14 generated has scattered 8s/9s/3 not matching expected 8-clusters.
 * Overall, attempt understands border uniformity (worked for static parts) but not canvas object evolution (didn't work: reversal misaligns shapes like 8-blobs or 9-dots, leading to extra/missing numbers); no object extraction attempted, which might help verify shapes post-reversal.
 * Function `is_uniform` is helpful and correct; the slicing logic in `program` is mostly sound but broken for variable canvas content (e.g., doesn't handle intra-row patterns or why some rows stay unchanged when they should flip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate puzzle understanding, as it mostly preserves or partially reverses the canvas but mangles object patterns similarly to training failures—e.g., rows 6-7 have scattered 9s in 7-clusters ([1,1,7,7,7,9,7,...] vs likely expected solid 7s with flipped 9-position for symmetry), and row 20 has [...,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,3,3] which introduces misplaced 2s not aligning with any clear flipped shape (expected might cluster 2s/8s/9s vertically from input patterns like row 12's 9s).
 * Lower rows (e.g., 24-28) show chaotic mixes like [1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,...] and [1,1,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,...] vs input's more structured 7s/2s/3s—reversal seems to flip but not correct orientations (e.g., 8,9 clusters appear fragmented, missing expected merges or border integrations like training's 2-inserts); overall, it looks like incomplete flipping without object awareness, so borders (top all-4s, bottom all-3s?) are handled but canvas shapes (7-blobs, 2/8/9 elements) are distorted, not making visual sense as a corrected image.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:22:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity where non-background blocks connected in 4-way adjacent groups of the same color form rigid "components" that fall downward as intact units, processed from the bottom of the grid upward to avoid interference, until they stack on other blocks or the bottom, with the background color being the most common value in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection must use the most frequent color across the entire flat grid, but handle empty grids gracefully (default to 0).
 * Connected components include single blocks and are strictly same-color and 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding background.
 * Components must be processed in bottom-to-top order by sorting on the maximum row index (highest row number first, assuming row 0 is top), to simulate gravity without later drops affecting earlier ones.
 * For dropping: Each component is cleared from the grid first, then the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background spaces below the lowest point of the component in each of its occupied columns (starting from just below that lowest row in the column).
 * Dropped positions must not exceed grid bounds; if the new row would be out of bounds, the block stays or clips, but in practice, it seems to cap at grid height.
 * Subtlety: Drop calculation is per-column lowest point, but the whole component shifts rigidly by the min drop across its columns, preserving relative positions (e.g., multi-column shapes don't rotate or separate).
 * Components can span multiple columns, and drop is limited by the "tightest" column (least space below), which can cause uneven stacking if columns have different obstacles.
 * After dropping one component, the grid updates, so subsequent components see the new state (e.g., they might land on previously dropped ones).
 * No merging or re-connection after drops; components remain as they were.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length), rows are lists of ints (colors 0-9 likely), and output must be a new grid with exact same dimensions.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order is critical—top-down would cause overlaps or incorrect stacking; also, "lowest" is max row index per column for the component.
 * Empty spaces are only background; non-background blocks block drops.
 * Singles and small groups must be treated identically to large ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent number in the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This works well for background detection, as seen in outputs where 5 seems to be background in example 1, but verify per grid.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find connected components of same non-background numbers (4-way adjacent), including singles."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != background:
                num = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == num:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, num))
    return components
```
(This correctly identifies components with positions as (row, col) tuples and color, using DFS/stack for connectivity; essential for rigid unit extraction.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (e.g., 5 in example 1, 2 in example 2) and finds connected components accurately, including singles and multi-block shapes.
 * Sorting components bottom-to-top by max row works in principle to process gravity order.
 * Clearing component before drop and attempting rigid shift by min column drop distance captures the core rigid-body fall idea.
 * Train 1 generated output keeps top rows unchanged (all 5s and some 1s/4s/2s static, which is correct for non-falling parts), but fails to properly drop lower components: e.g., 8s and 9s in rows 7-11 are misplaced or not dropped far enough (generated has 8s scattered in row 9-11 without forming expected clusters like [8,8,8,8] in row 2 of expected), and a 1 in row 7 col 18 is wrong (expected has 8 there); also, row 4 expected has 8s/9s/4s/2s in specific positions, but generated has incorrect 5s/8s/9s scattering—likely due to flawed per-column lowest calc or not updating grid properly for subsequent drops.
 * Train 2 generated output correctly keeps top 2s and bottom 3s static, and stacks some 4s/1s/7s in upper rows, but messes up lower drops: e.g., row 11 expected has 2s/9/2s but generated has all 1s/7s; row 17 expected has 1s but generated has 8s misplaced; row 20 expected has 4/8/9/1s but generated has scattered 8s/9s/4s/2s/3s in wrong spots—drop distance underestimates space in some columns, causing partial overlaps or insufficient fall; also, 3 in row 23 expected but generated has 9/1s there.
 * Overall, drop logic fails: col_lowest uses max i per column (correct for lowest point), but count of backgrounds below starts from lowest+1 and stops at first non-background (correct), yet min(d) across columns leads to too-small drops, as seen in both trains where components don't reach expected stacked positions (e.g., 8-group in train 1 should drop more to row 2-4 area).
 * No rotation or color change, which is correct, but grid copy (new_g) is good to avoid mutating original.
 * Function get_background and find_connected_components are helpful and accurate; main program drop calc is broken (under-drops, possibly miscounts empties after prior clears).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the inf drop init and stack-based DFS are solid—avoid recursive DFS to prevent stack overflow in large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with two full rows of 4s (possibly assuming 4 as background, but input likely has different bg—wait, input not shown, but output has 4s filling top, which shouldn't happen as static parts should remain), then repeats [1,1,7s,2s,7s,3s] blocks identically across rows 2-20 without variation, indicating no drops occurred for most components (rigid 7/2/3 strips didn't fall), and bottom rows 21-30 have chaotic scattering of 1/7/8/9/2/4/3 (e.g., row 29 has mixed 1/4/3/9/9/7/9/9/8/8/7/1/7/2/2/7/7/7/7/9/7/7/2/2/4/3/3, far from any stacked order)—this suggests components weren't cleared/dropped properly, min-drop was 0 for many (no fall), or sorting failed, leading to static copy with minor bottom jumble; expected should have upper static rows, then fallen 7/8/9 groups stacking rigidly from bottom (e.g., 8s/9s dropping into lower rows without overlap, preserving shapes like vertical 7 strips but shifted down by column-min empties).

[2025-10-01 21:22:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a falling blocks or gravity-based puzzle (similar to games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Puyo Puyo) where numbered blocks (representing colors or types) fall downward under gravity within a grid, but with rules that likely involve connected groups of the same number falling as units, potential matching/removal of adjacent same-number blocks, and rebuilding the grid after falls. The goal is to simulate one step of falling and settling, resulting in a new grid configuration.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks fall downward (toward higher row indices, assuming row 0 is top) but only until they hit another block or the bottom; independent per-cell falling doesn't work, as seen in mismatches where groups shift together.
 * Connected components of the same number likely fall as rigid units if adjacent (horizontally or vertically), preserving their shape during descent, rather than per-column independent movement—this explains why simple column gravity scrambles group positions in expected outputs.
 * No explicit empty cells (0s) are visible in inputs/outputs; all cells seem filled with numbers (1-9), so "empty" might be implicit or handled differently (e.g., gaps created by falling but not shown, or the grid is always dense).
 * Matching rules may apply: adjacent (3+ in a row/column) same numbers might disappear before or after falling, creating space for further drops, but this isn't simulated in the attempt—subtle because outputs show rearranged but not removed blocks.
 * Grid is represented as List[List[int]] with rows as outer lists; falling affects vertical positions but may involve horizontal stability for connected blobs.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s in train 1/2) seem fixed or "floor" layers that don't move, suggesting gravity only applies above certain stable bases.
 * Subtle: Rotations, merges, or color-specific behaviors (e.g., 5s as background?) might occur, but easy to miss without full rules; outputs show specific repositions like 8s/9s clustering differently.
 * All attempts must preserve grid dimensions and number distributions—no creation/destruction except possibly via matches.
 * Consider iterative falling: blocks may need multiple passes until stable, as single-pass column gravity leaves floating groups in generated vs. expected.

    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple per-column gravity, which worked for basic downward movement in isolated columns (e.g., stacking non-empties at bottom) but failed to handle connected groups across columns, leading to scrambled positions.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps many 5s static and drops 8s/9s/2s/1s/4s incorrectly per column (e.g., row 3 has 9 in col 18 generated vs. expected 8s cluster in cols 17-20; row 5 has 8s/9s/4/2 misplaced vs. expected 8s/9s/2s in specific blob shapes); unknown why blobs don't preserve shape, but likely because no component detection.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated drops 8s/9s/2s/4s/3s per column, creating floating or misaligned groups (e.g., row 11 has 8s/9s scattered vs. expected clustered 2s/9s in cols 17-20 and 8s below; row 18 has 9 in col 6 generated vs. expected 8s/7s cluster; bottom 3s intact but upper layers wrong); simple gravity ignores horizontal connections.
 * extract_columns and build_grid are helpful for column-wise ops but broken for this puzzle as they enable only independent falls, not group-aware simulation (still useful as building blocks).
 * apply_gravity is unhelpful/broken: Assumes empty=0 (but no 0s in grids), moves all non-empties to bottom per column without checking connections or stability, causing over-dropping and loss of structure (don't use in future without mods for groups).
 * No detection of matches/removals, missing potential disappearances that create fall space.
 * Core issue: Treats grid as independent columns instead of holistic structure with blobs; this partially understands vertical falling (some bottom stacking matches) but misses horizontal adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies simplistic per-column stacking (e.g., all 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s/2s/1s dropped to bottoms of their columns, creating dense lower layers with floating mismatches like isolated 9s/8s in upper rows), but ignores connected groups—e.g., clusters of 8s/9s in cols 4-6 and 20-23 should likely fall as units preserving shapes, not scatter vertically per column (generated has 8s split across rows 3-11 in col 4 vs. expected probable tight drop to row 5-7 or similar). This results in unnatural fragmentation (e.g., row 6 has scattered 3/8/7 vs. expected consolidated blobs) and doesn't account for potential matches (e.g., multiple adjacent 7s might clear). Without expected, it visually resembles over-simplified Tetris drops but fails training logic, so likely wrong; needs group detection to handle test's complex 7/8/9 clusters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, likely representing a "canvas" or image that needs to be vertically flipped or reversed between uniform border rows (top and bottom), while preserving those borders, to match evolving patterns across multiple frames or examples. The goal is to process a sequence of grids (as a list of rows) and output the transformed version that aligns with expected visual changes, such as correcting orientations or symmetries in drawn objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify uniform rows (all elements identical) at the top and bottom as fixed borders that should not be altered or included in any reversal.
 * The "canvas" is the non-uniform middle section between borders; it must be reversed vertically (i.e., flip the order of rows in this section) to correct the orientation, but only if it matches the puzzle's visual logic—subtly, not all middle rows may need full reversal if they contain partial patterns or evolving elements.
 * Patterns in the middle often represent "objects" or shapes (e.g., sequences of 8s forming a blob or line, 9s as highlights, or mixed numbers like 1,2 for structures) that evolve across rows; reversal should preserve their internal structure but flip their vertical position to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Uniformity check must be strict (empty rows are uniform, but grids are non-empty); borders may vary in thickness (multiple consecutive uniform rows); reversal applies only to the canvas, but if borders are misidentified (e.g., a nearly uniform row with one outlier is not uniform), the canvas slice is wrong, leading to partial reversals or unchanged rows.
 * Across examples, top borders are often solid (e.g., all 1s or 5s), bottom are solid (e.g., all 2s or 3s), and canvas has asymmetric patterns that need flipping to symmetrize or correct (e.g., in training 1, row 3 expected has 8s ending with 2, suggesting a shape adjustment post-reversal).
 * Easy to miss: Reversal is row-order flip, not element-level; some rows in canvas may appear uniform after reversal but weren't before; evolving frames mean the program must handle varying border sizes and non-symmetric objects; test grids have wider dimensions (28 columns vs 26 in training), so code must be dimension-agnostic.
 * Considerations from attempts: Over-reversing includes border rows if uniformity is mischecked; under-reversing leaves canvas intact when it should flip; objects like 8-clusters or 9-dots may need extraction to verify post-reversal shapes, but simple reversal alone fails if borders shift per row.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)
```
(This function correctly identifies uniform rows for border detection; it's reliable and should be reused.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```
(This is the core program from the attempt; it correctly slices and reverses the canvas but fails on border precision and full pattern matching—helpful as a base but needs refinement for object-aware reversal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and skips multi-row uniform borders (e.g., in training 1, it skips top all-1s/5s and bottom all-2s correctly in many rows), preserving them unchanged, which matches expected outputs where borders stay static.
 * Reversal of the canvas works partially for simple cases (e.g., in training 1 rows 1-2 and 10-13, generated matches expected all-5s/1s with 4,4 inserts), but fails when canvas contains asymmetric objects: e.g., training 1 row 3 generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,9,9,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,2,2]—generated has 8,9,9,8 (wrong shape, extra 9s, no 2 inserts) instead of solid 8s with 2s, suggesting reversal didn't align the blob correctly or mis-sliced canvas.
 * In training 1 row 4, generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2]—minor mismatch in canvas reversal (e.g., 4 placement wrong, 9 not flipped properly), indicating border detection skipped too few rows or reversal order is off for evolving patterns.
 * Training 1 row 5 generated has scattered 2s and 8s not matching expected clustered 8s with 2s; row 6 has 1s and 8s misplaced vs expected 1,8,8,9 cluster—unknown why reversal creates these outliers, possibly because canvas includes semi-uniform rows.
 * Training 2 shows similar issues: borders (top all-2s, bottom all-3s, side 4,4 and 7,7) preserved well, but canvas reversal fails badly—e.g., row 11 generated [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7] vs expected [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1,7,7], where generated inserts wrong 4s instead of flipping to include 2,9 pattern; row 14 generated has scattered 8s/9s/3 not matching expected 8-clusters.
 * Overall, attempt understands border uniformity (worked for static parts) but not canvas object evolution (didn't work: reversal misaligns shapes like 8-blobs or 9-dots, leading to extra/missing numbers); no object extraction attempted, which might help verify shapes post-reversal.
 * Function `is_uniform` is helpful and correct; the slicing logic in `program` is mostly sound but broken for variable canvas content (e.g., doesn't handle intra-row patterns or why some rows stay unchanged when they should flip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate puzzle understanding, as it mostly preserves or partially reverses the canvas but mangles object patterns similarly to training failures—e.g., rows 6-7 have scattered 9s in 7-clusters ([1,1,7,7,7,9,7,...] vs likely expected solid 7s with flipped 9-position for symmetry), and row 20 has [...,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,3,3] which introduces misplaced 2s not aligning with any clear flipped shape (expected might cluster 2s/8s/9s vertically from input patterns like row 12's 9s).
 * Lower rows (e.g., 24-28) show chaotic mixes like [1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,...] and [1,1,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,...] vs input's more structured 7s/2s/3s—reversal seems to flip but not correct orientations (e.g., 8,9 clusters appear fragmented, missing expected merges or border integrations like training's 2-inserts); overall, it looks like incomplete flipping without object awareness, so borders (top all-4s, bottom all-3s?) are handled but canvas shapes (7-blobs, 2/8/9 elements) are distorted, not making visual sense as a corrected image.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity where non-background blocks connected in 4-way adjacent groups of the same color form rigid "components" that fall downward as intact units, processed from the bottom of the grid upward to avoid interference, until they stack on other blocks or the bottom, with the background color being the most common value in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection must use the most frequent color across the entire flat grid, but handle empty grids gracefully (default to 0).
 * Connected components include single blocks and are strictly same-color and 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding background.
 * Components must be processed in bottom-to-top order by sorting on the maximum row index (highest row number first, assuming row 0 is top), to simulate gravity without later drops affecting earlier ones.
 * For dropping: Each component is cleared from the grid first, then the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background spaces below the lowest point of the component in each of its occupied columns (starting from just below that lowest row in the column).
 * Dropped positions must not exceed grid bounds; if the new row would be out of bounds, the block stays or clips, but in practice, it seems to cap at grid height.
 * Subtlety: Drop calculation is per-column lowest point, but the whole component shifts rigidly by the min drop across its columns, preserving relative positions (e.g., multi-column shapes don't rotate or separate).
 * Components can span multiple columns, and drop is limited by the "tightest" column (least space below), which can cause uneven stacking if columns have different obstacles.
 * After dropping one component, the grid updates, so subsequent components see the new state (e.g., they might land on previously dropped ones).
 * No merging or re-connection after drops; components remain as they were.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length), rows are lists of ints (colors 0-9 likely), and output must be a new grid with exact same dimensions.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order is critical—top-down would cause overlaps or incorrect stacking; also, "lowest" is max row index per column for the component.
 * Empty spaces are only background; non-background blocks block drops.
 * Singles and small groups must be treated identically to large ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent number in the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This works well for background detection, as seen in outputs where 5 seems to be background in example 1, but verify per grid.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find connected components of same non-background numbers (4-way adjacent), including singles."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != background:
                num = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == num:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, num))
    return components
```
(This correctly identifies components with positions as (row, col) tuples and color, using DFS/stack for connectivity; essential for rigid unit extraction.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (e.g., 5 in example 1, 2 in example 2) and finds connected components accurately, including singles and multi-block shapes.
 * Sorting components bottom-to-top by max row works in principle to process gravity order.
 * Clearing component before drop and attempting rigid shift by min column drop distance captures the core rigid-body fall idea.
 * Train 1 generated output keeps top rows unchanged (all 5s and some 1s/4s/2s static, which is correct for non-falling parts), but fails to properly drop lower components: e.g., 8s and 9s in rows 7-11 are misplaced or not dropped far enough (generated has 8s scattered in row 9-11 without forming expected clusters like [8,8,8,8] in row 2 of expected), and a 1 in row 7 col 18 is wrong (expected has 8 there); also, row 4 expected has 8s/9s/4s/2s in specific positions, but generated has incorrect 5s/8s/9s scattering—likely due to flawed per-column lowest calc or not updating grid properly for subsequent drops.
 * Train 2 generated output correctly keeps top 2s and bottom 3s static, and stacks some 4s/1s/7s in upper rows, but messes up lower drops: e.g., row 11 expected has 2s/9/2s but generated has all 1s/7s; row 17 expected has 1s but generated has 8s misplaced; row 20 expected has 4/8/9/1s but generated has scattered 8s/9s/4s/2s/3s in wrong spots—drop distance underestimates space in some columns, causing partial overlaps or insufficient fall; also, 3 in row 23 expected but generated has 9/1s there.
 * Overall, drop logic fails: col_lowest uses max i per column (correct for lowest point), but count of backgrounds below starts from lowest+1 and stops at first non-background (correct), yet min(d) across columns leads to too-small drops, as seen in both trains where components don't reach expected stacked positions (e.g., 8-group in train 1 should drop more to row 2-4 area).
 * No rotation or color change, which is correct, but grid copy (new_g) is good to avoid mutating original.
 * Function get_background and find_connected_components are helpful and accurate; main program drop calc is broken (under-drops, possibly miscounts empties after prior clears).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the inf drop init and stack-based DFS are solid—avoid recursive DFS to prevent stack overflow in large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with two full rows of 4s (possibly assuming 4 as background, but input likely has different bg—wait, input not shown, but output has 4s filling top, which shouldn't happen as static parts should remain), then repeats [1,1,7s,2s,7s,3s] blocks identically across rows 2-20 without variation, indicating no drops occurred for most components (rigid 7/2/3 strips didn't fall), and bottom rows 21-30 have chaotic scattering of 1/7/8/9/2/4/3 (e.g., row 29 has mixed 1/4/3/9/9/7/9/9/8/8/7/1/7/2/2/7/7/7/7/9/7/7/2/2/4/3/3, far from any stacked order)—this suggests components weren't cleared/dropped properly, min-drop was 0 for many (no fall), or sorting failed, leading to static copy with minor bottom jumble; expected should have upper static rows, then fallen 7/8/9 groups stacking rigidly from bottom (e.g., 8s/9s dropping into lower rows without overlap, preserving shapes like vertical 7 strips but shifted down by column-min empties).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 21:37:13] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle appears to simulate a block-dropping game on a grid where numbers represent colored blocks, with upward gravity (blocks move toward the top of the grid, i.e., lower row indices), removal of connected groups of three or more 9s, and a second application of gravity after removal to settle the grid. The goal is to process an input grid through these mechanics to produce a stable final state, preserving non-9 blocks and handling connectivity correctly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the grid, used to identify empty space for gravity drops.
 * Connected components are defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background number; single blocks are treated as components of size 1.
 * Gravity is upward (delta=-1, moving to lower row indices), and entire components drop as rigid units; the drop distance for a component is the minimum clear space above any of its blocks in the same column.
 * Components must be processed in a specific order during gravity: sort by descending max row (process "lower" components first), then descending min row, to avoid interference from higher-dropping components.
 * Removal targets only connected groups of 9s with size >=3; smaller 9 groups or singles stay, and removal sets them to background without triggering chain reactions beyond the second gravity pass.
 * After first gravity, remove 9 groups, then apply gravity again; no further removals or iterations.
 * Grid is rectangular; assume consistent row lengths, but handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Subtle: When clearing a component for drop calculation, the grid temporarily has holes, but drops are per-column and min across the component; if min_d=0, restore without moving.
 * Subtle: Gravity loop continues until no movement, but in practice, one pass per phase may suffice if stable.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order prevents components from blocking each other incorrectly; without it, drops can overlap or skip.
 * Easy to miss: 9 removal happens only once, post-first gravity, and only on connected 9s >=3; other numbers never remove.
 * Consideration: Outputs are flattened rows (lists of ints), but grids are 2D; preserve structure but print as 1D per row.
 * Consideration: In example 2, many 1s consolidate but some structures like 8s and 2s partially survive or reposition differently, suggesting complex interactions.

            r += delta
        min_d = min(min_d, d)
    return min_d
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies background via frequency and uses 4-way connected components, which is essential for grouping.
 * Gravity implementation moves components as units with min drop distance, which works for basic settling but fails in ordering: sorting by (-max_i, -min_i) processes "lower" first, but in training example 1, it leads to incorrect repositioning of 8s and 5s (e.g., generated has stacked 8s in row 2-3 that don't match expected scattered 8s and 2s integration).
 * In training example 1, post-removal gravity doesn't properly handle surviving 9s or 1s; generated ends with uniform 5s in many rows, but expected has varied placements like 8s in row 3 cols 17-20, a 2 in row 3 col 21, and specific 4/8/9 mixes in row 4—differences suggest over-dropping or incorrect clearing/restoration when min_d=0.
 * In training example 2, initial gravity consolidates 1s and 8s too aggressively upward, creating uniform 1 rows (e.g., generated rows 8-11 all 1s in many cols), but expected keeps more structure like isolated 2/9/8 groups lower (e.g., expected row 12 has 2s and 9, row 13 has 4/8/9/8)—this indicates the component processing order or drop calculation ignores inter-component collisions after clearing.
 * 9 removal works (groups >=3 cleared), but in example 2, generated removes some 8s/9s incorrectly or fails second gravity, leading to leftover 9s in row 6 and uniform bottoms, unlike expected where 8s form lines in rows 13-14/18-21 but 9s are isolated or removed selectively.
 * The apply_gravity loop with while True and moved flag is helpful for stability, but in practice, it over-applies in examples, homogenizing grids (e.g., all 2s at top in example 2 generated, but expected has 2s integrated lower).
 * remove_large_nines_groups is correct and relevant, as it targets only 9s >=3 connected.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are core, but compute_drop_distance may undercount if grid changes mid-drop (though it clears first, so potentially okay—issue likely in sequencing).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive stacking of 7s in nearly all middle rows (rows 3-30+ mostly 7s with some 2s/3s/9s sprinkled), and uniform 4s at the very top, which homogenizes the input's mixed 1/7/8/9/3/2/4 distribution unrealistically.
 * Input has diverse clusters (e.g., 7s scattered, 8s in groups, 3s at right bottom, 2s in cols 15-16), but output treats most non-4/3 as 7s dropping fully upward, ignoring distinct component identities—e.g., 8s and 9s should form separate groups post-gravity/removal, not merge into 7 stacks.
 * No 9 removal evident (input has potential 9 groups, like row 3 col7/ row4 col6, but output has stray 9s without clearing >=3), and second gravity seems to collapse everything without preserving shapes, unlike training expects where structures like 8-lines or 2-clusters survive in specific positions.
 * Bottom 3s are preserved but isolated; overall, output lacks the expected partial consolidation (e.g., 7s should cluster but not dominate all space, per training patterns), suggesting the program fails on larger/mixed grids by over-simplifying drops.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:37:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a falling blocks or gravity-based puzzle (similar to games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Puyo Puyo) where numbered blocks (representing colors or types) fall downward under gravity within a grid, but with rules that likely involve connected groups of the same number falling as units, potential matching/removal of adjacent same-number blocks, and rebuilding the grid after falls. The goal is to simulate one step of falling and settling, resulting in a new grid configuration.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks fall downward (toward higher row indices, assuming row 0 is top) but only until they hit another block or the bottom; independent per-cell falling doesn't work, as seen in mismatches where groups shift together.
 * Connected components of the same number likely fall as rigid units if adjacent (horizontally or vertically), preserving their shape during descent, rather than per-column independent movement—this explains why simple column gravity scrambles group positions in expected outputs.
 * No explicit empty cells (0s) are visible in inputs/outputs; all cells seem filled with numbers (1-9), so "empty" might be implicit or handled differently (e.g., gaps created by falling but not shown, or the grid is always dense).
 * Matching rules may apply: adjacent (3+ in a row/column) same numbers might disappear before or after falling, creating space for further drops, but this isn't simulated in the attempt—subtle because outputs show rearranged but not removed blocks.
 * Grid is represented as List[List[int]] with rows as outer lists; falling affects vertical positions but may involve horizontal stability for connected blobs.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s in train 1/2) seem fixed or "floor" layers that don't move, suggesting gravity only applies above certain stable bases.
 * Subtle: Rotations, merges, or color-specific behaviors (e.g., 5s as background?) might occur, but easy to miss without full rules; outputs show specific repositions like 8s/9s clustering differently.
 * All attempts must preserve grid dimensions and number distributions—no creation/destruction except possibly via matches.
 * Consider iterative falling: blocks may need multiple passes until stable, as single-pass column gravity leaves floating groups in generated vs. expected.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple per-column gravity, which worked for basic downward movement in isolated columns (e.g., stacking non-empties at bottom) but failed to handle connected groups across columns, leading to scrambled positions.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps many 5s static and drops 8s/9s/2s/1s/4s incorrectly per column (e.g., row 3 has 9 in col 18 generated vs. expected 8s cluster in cols 17-20; row 5 has 8s/9s/4/2 misplaced vs. expected 8s/9s/2s in specific blob shapes); unknown why blobs don't preserve shape, but likely because no component detection.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated drops 8s/9s/2s/4s/3s per column, creating floating or misaligned groups (e.g., row 11 has 8s/9s scattered vs. expected clustered 2s/9s in cols 17-20 and 8s below; row 18 has 9 in col 6 generated vs. expected 8s/7s cluster; bottom 3s intact but upper layers wrong); simple gravity ignores horizontal connections.
 * extract_columns and build_grid are helpful for column-wise ops but broken for this puzzle as they enable only independent falls, not group-aware simulation (still useful as building blocks).
 * apply_gravity is unhelpful/broken: Assumes empty=0 (but no 0s in grids), moves all non-empties to bottom per column without checking connections or stability, causing over-dropping and loss of structure (don't use in future without mods for groups).
 * No detection of matches/removals, missing potential disappearances that create fall space.
 * Core issue: Treats grid as independent columns instead of holistic structure with blobs; this partially understands vertical falling (some bottom stacking matches) but misses horizontal adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies simplistic per-column stacking (e.g., all 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s/2s/1s dropped to bottoms of their columns, creating dense lower layers with floating mismatches like isolated 9s/8s in upper rows), but ignores connected groups—e.g., clusters of 8s/9s in cols 4-6 and 20-23 should likely fall as units preserving shapes, not scatter vertically per column (generated has 8s split across rows 3-11 in col 4 vs. expected probable tight drop to row 5-7 or similar). This results in unnatural fragmentation (e.g., row 6 has scattered 3/8/7 vs. expected consolidated blobs) and doesn't account for potential matches (e.g., multiple adjacent 7s might clear). Without expected, it visually resembles over-simplified Tetris drops but fails training logic, so likely wrong; needs group detection to handle test's complex 7/8/9 clusters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to simulate a block-dropping game on a grid where numbers represent colored blocks, with upward gravity (blocks move toward the top of the grid, i.e., lower row indices), removal of connected groups of three or more 9s, and a second application of gravity after removal to settle the grid. The goal is to process an input grid through these mechanics to produce a stable final state, preserving non-9 blocks and handling connectivity correctly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the grid, used to identify empty space for gravity drops.
 * Connected components are defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background number; single blocks are treated as components of size 1.
 * Gravity is upward (delta=-1, moving to lower row indices), and entire components drop as rigid units; the drop distance for a component is the minimum clear space above any of its blocks in the same column.
 * Components must be processed in a specific order during gravity: sort by descending max row (process "lower" components first), then descending min row, to avoid interference from higher-dropping components.
 * Removal targets only connected groups of 9s with size >=3; smaller 9 groups or singles stay, and removal sets them to background without triggering chain reactions beyond the second gravity pass.
 * After first gravity, remove 9 groups, then apply gravity again; no further removals or iterations.
 * Grid is rectangular; assume consistent row lengths, but handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Subtle: When clearing a component for drop calculation, the grid temporarily has holes, but drops are per-column and min across the component; if min_d=0, restore without moving.
 * Subtle: Gravity loop continues until no movement, but in practice, one pass per phase may suffice if stable.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order prevents components from blocking each other incorrectly; without it, drops can overlap or skip.
 * Easy to miss: 9 removal happens only once, post-first gravity, and only on connected 9s >=3; other numbers never remove.
 * Consideration: Outputs are flattened rows (lists of ints), but grids are 2D; preserve structure but print as 1D per row.
 * Consideration: In example 2, many 1s consolidate but some structures like 8s and 2s partially survive or reposition differently, suggesting complex interactions.

    return min_d
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies background via frequency and uses 4-way connected components, which is essential for grouping.
 * Gravity implementation moves components as units with min drop distance, which works for basic settling but fails in ordering: sorting by (-max_i, -min_i) processes "lower" first, but in training example 1, it leads to incorrect repositioning of 8s and 5s (e.g., generated has stacked 8s in row 2-3 that don't match expected scattered 8s and 2s integration).
 * In training example 1, post-removal gravity doesn't properly handle surviving 9s or 1s; generated ends with uniform 5s in many rows, but expected has varied placements like 8s in row 3 cols 17-20, a 2 in row 3 col 21, and specific 4/8/9 mixes in row 4—differences suggest over-dropping or incorrect clearing/restoration when min_d=0.
 * In training example 2, initial gravity consolidates 1s and 8s too aggressively upward, creating uniform 1 rows (e.g., generated rows 8-11 all 1s in many cols), but expected keeps more structure like isolated 2/9/8 groups lower (e.g., expected row 12 has 2s and 9, row 13 has 4/8/9/8)—this indicates the component processing order or drop calculation ignores inter-component collisions after clearing.
 * 9 removal works (groups >=3 cleared), but in example 2, generated removes some 8s/9s incorrectly or fails second gravity, leading to leftover 9s in row 6 and uniform bottoms, unlike expected where 8s form lines in rows 13-14/18-21 but 9s are isolated or removed selectively.
 * The apply_gravity loop with while True and moved flag is helpful for stability, but in practice, it over-applies in examples, homogenizing grids (e.g., all 2s at top in example 2 generated, but expected has 2s integrated lower).
 * remove_large_nines_groups is correct and relevant, as it targets only 9s >=3 connected.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are core, but compute_drop_distance may undercount if grid changes mid-drop (though it clears first, so potentially okay—issue likely in sequencing).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive stacking of 7s in nearly all middle rows (rows 3-30+ mostly 7s with some 2s/3s/9s sprinkled), and uniform 4s at the very top, which homogenizes the input's mixed 1/7/8/9/3/2/4 distribution unrealistically.
 * Input has diverse clusters (e.g., 7s scattered, 8s in groups, 3s at right bottom, 2s in cols 15-16), but output treats most non-4/3 as 7s dropping fully upward, ignoring distinct component identities—e.g., 8s and 9s should form separate groups post-gravity/removal, not merge into 7 stacks.
 * No 9 removal evident (input has potential 9 groups, like row 3 col7/ row4 col6, but output has stray 9s without clearing >=3), and second gravity seems to collapse everything without preserving shapes, unlike training expects where structures like 8-lines or 2-clusters survive in specific positions.
 * Bottom 3s are preserved but isolated; overall, output lacks the expected partial consolidation (e.g., 7s should cluster but not dominate all space, per training patterns), suggesting the program fails on larger/mixed grids by over-simplifying drops.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, likely representing a "canvas" or image that needs to be vertically flipped or reversed between uniform border rows (top and bottom), while preserving those borders, to match evolving patterns across multiple frames or examples. The goal is to process a sequence of grids (as a list of rows) and output the transformed version that aligns with expected visual changes, such as correcting orientations or symmetries in drawn objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify uniform rows (all elements identical) at the top and bottom as fixed borders that should not be altered or included in any reversal.
 * The "canvas" is the non-uniform middle section between borders; it must be reversed vertically (i.e., flip the order of rows in this section) to correct the orientation, but only if it matches the puzzle's visual logic—subtly, not all middle rows may need full reversal if they contain partial patterns or evolving elements.
 * Patterns in the middle often represent "objects" or shapes (e.g., sequences of 8s forming a blob or line, 9s as highlights, or mixed numbers like 1,2 for structures) that evolve across rows; reversal should preserve their internal structure but flip their vertical position to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Uniformity check must be strict (empty rows are uniform, but grids are non-empty); borders may vary in thickness (multiple consecutive uniform rows); reversal applies only to the canvas, but if borders are misidentified (e.g., a nearly uniform row with one outlier is not uniform), the canvas slice is wrong, leading to partial reversals or unchanged rows.
 * Across examples, top borders are often solid (e.g., all 1s or 5s), bottom are solid (e.g., all 2s or 3s), and canvas has asymmetric patterns that need flipping to symmetrize or correct (e.g., in training 1, row 3 expected has 8s ending with 2, suggesting a shape adjustment post-reversal).
 * Easy to miss: Reversal is row-order flip, not element-level; some rows in canvas may appear uniform after reversal but weren't before; evolving frames mean the program must handle varying border sizes and non-symmetric objects; test grids have wider dimensions (28 columns vs 26 in training), so code must be dimension-agnostic.
 * Considerations from attempts: Over-reversing includes border rows if uniformity is mischecked; under-reversing leaves canvas intact when it should flip; objects like 8-clusters or 9-dots may need extraction to verify post-reversal shapes, but simple reversal alone fails if borders shift per row.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)
```
(This function correctly identifies uniform rows for border detection; it's reliable and should be reused.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```
(This is the core program from the attempt; it correctly slices and reverses the canvas but fails on border precision and full pattern matching—helpful as a base but needs refinement for object-aware reversal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and skips multi-row uniform borders (e.g., in training 1, it skips top all-1s/5s and bottom all-2s correctly in many rows), preserving them unchanged, which matches expected outputs where borders stay static.
 * Reversal of the canvas works partially for simple cases (e.g., in training 1 rows 1-2 and 10-13, generated matches expected all-5s/1s with 4,4 inserts), but fails when canvas contains asymmetric objects: e.g., training 1 row 3 generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,9,9,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,2,2]—generated has 8,9,9,8 (wrong shape, extra 9s, no 2 inserts) instead of solid 8s with 2s, suggesting reversal didn't align the blob correctly or mis-sliced canvas.
 * In training 1 row 4, generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2]—minor mismatch in canvas reversal (e.g., 4 placement wrong, 9 not flipped properly), indicating border detection skipped too few rows or reversal order is off for evolving patterns.
 * Training 1 row 5 generated has scattered 2s and 8s not matching expected clustered 8s with 2s; row 6 has 1s and 8s misplaced vs expected 1,8,8,9 cluster—unknown why reversal creates these outliers, possibly because canvas includes semi-uniform rows.
 * Training 2 shows similar issues: borders (top all-2s, bottom all-3s, side 4,4 and 7,7) preserved well, but canvas reversal fails badly—e.g., row 11 generated [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7] vs expected [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1,7,7], where generated inserts wrong 4s instead of flipping to include 2,9 pattern; row 14 generated has scattered 8s/9s/3 not matching expected 8-clusters.
 * Overall, attempt understands border uniformity (worked for static parts) but not canvas object evolution (didn't work: reversal misaligns shapes like 8-blobs or 9-dots, leading to extra/missing numbers); no object extraction attempted, which might help verify shapes post-reversal.
 * Function `is_uniform` is helpful and correct; the slicing logic in `program` is mostly sound but broken for variable canvas content (e.g., doesn't handle intra-row patterns or why some rows stay unchanged when they should flip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate puzzle understanding, as it mostly preserves or partially reverses the canvas but mangles object patterns similarly to training failures—e.g., rows 6-7 have scattered 9s in 7-clusters ([1,1,7,7,7,9,7,...] vs likely expected solid 7s with flipped 9-position for symmetry), and row 20 has [...,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,3,3] which introduces misplaced 2s not aligning with any clear flipped shape (expected might cluster 2s/8s/9s vertically from input patterns like row 12's 9s).
 * Lower rows (e.g., 24-28) show chaotic mixes like [1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,...] and [1,1,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,...] vs input's more structured 7s/2s/3s—reversal seems to flip but not correct orientations (e.g., 8,9 clusters appear fragmented, missing expected merges or border integrations like training's 2-inserts); overall, it looks like incomplete flipping without object awareness, so borders (top all-4s, bottom all-3s?) are handled but canvas shapes (7-blobs, 2/8/9 elements) are distorted, not making visual sense as a corrected image.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity where non-background blocks connected in 4-way adjacent groups of the same color form rigid "components" that fall downward as intact units, processed from the bottom of the grid upward to avoid interference, until they stack on other blocks or the bottom, with the background color being the most common value in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection must use the most frequent color across the entire flat grid, but handle empty grids gracefully (default to 0).
 * Connected components include single blocks and are strictly same-color and 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding background.
 * Components must be processed in bottom-to-top order by sorting on the maximum row index (highest row number first, assuming row 0 is top), to simulate gravity without later drops affecting earlier ones.
 * For dropping: Each component is cleared from the grid first, then the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background spaces below the lowest point of the component in each of its occupied columns (starting from just below that lowest row in the column).
 * Dropped positions must not exceed grid bounds; if the new row would be out of bounds, the block stays or clips, but in practice, it seems to cap at grid height.
 * Subtlety: Drop calculation is per-column lowest point, but the whole component shifts rigidly by the min drop across its columns, preserving relative positions (e.g., multi-column shapes don't rotate or separate).
 * Components can span multiple columns, and drop is limited by the "tightest" column (least space below), which can cause uneven stacking if columns have different obstacles.
 * After dropping one component, the grid updates, so subsequent components see the new state (e.g., they might land on previously dropped ones).
 * No merging or re-connection after drops; components remain as they were.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length), rows are lists of ints (colors 0-9 likely), and output must be a new grid with exact same dimensions.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order is critical—top-down would cause overlaps or incorrect stacking; also, "lowest" is max row index per column for the component.
 * Empty spaces are only background; non-background blocks block drops.
 * Singles and small groups must be treated identically to large ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent number in the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This works well for background detection, as seen in outputs where 5 seems to be background in example 1, but verify per grid.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find connected components of same non-background numbers (4-way adjacent), including singles."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != background:
                num = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == num:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, num))
    return components
```
(This correctly identifies components with positions as (row, col) tuples and color, using DFS/stack for connectivity; essential for rigid unit extraction.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (e.g., 5 in example 1, 2 in example 2) and finds connected components accurately, including singles and multi-block shapes.
 * Sorting components bottom-to-top by max row works in principle to process gravity order.
 * Clearing component before drop and attempting rigid shift by min column drop distance captures the core rigid-body fall idea.
 * Train 1 generated output keeps top rows unchanged (all 5s and some 1s/4s/2s static, which is correct for non-falling parts), but fails to properly drop lower components: e.g., 8s and 9s in rows 7-11 are misplaced or not dropped far enough (generated has 8s scattered in row 9-11 without forming expected clusters like [8,8,8,8] in row 2 of expected), and a 1 in row 7 col 18 is wrong (expected has 8 there); also, row 4 expected has 8s/9s/4s/2s in specific positions, but generated has incorrect 5s/8s/9s scattering—likely due to flawed per-column lowest calc or not updating grid properly for subsequent drops.
 * Train 2 generated output correctly keeps top 2s and bottom 3s static, and stacks some 4s/1s/7s in upper rows, but messes up lower drops: e.g., row 11 expected has 2s/9/2s but generated has all 1s/7s; row 17 expected has 1s but generated has 8s misplaced; row 20 expected has 4/8/9/1s but generated has scattered 8s/9s/4s/2s/3s in wrong spots—drop distance underestimates space in some columns, causing partial overlaps or insufficient fall; also, 3 in row 23 expected but generated has 9/1s there.
 * Overall, drop logic fails: col_lowest uses max i per column (correct for lowest point), but count of backgrounds below starts from lowest+1 and stops at first non-background (correct), yet min(d) across columns leads to too-small drops, as seen in both trains where components don't reach expected stacked positions (e.g., 8-group in train 1 should drop more to row 2-4 area).
 * No rotation or color change, which is correct, but grid copy (new_g) is good to avoid mutating original.
 * Function get_background and find_connected_components are helpful and accurate; main program drop calc is broken (under-drops, possibly miscounts empties after prior clears).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the inf drop init and stack-based DFS are solid—avoid recursive DFS to prevent stack overflow in large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with two full rows of 4s (possibly assuming 4 as background, but input likely has different bg—wait, input not shown, but output has 4s filling top, which shouldn't happen as static parts should remain), then repeats [1,1,7s,2s,7s,3s] blocks identically across rows 2-20 without variation, indicating no drops occurred for most components (rigid 7/2/3 strips didn't fall), and bottom rows 21-30 have chaotic scattering of 1/7/8/9/2/4/3 (e.g., row 29 has mixed 1/4/3/9/9/7/9/9/8/8/7/1/7/2/2/7/7/7/7/9/7/7/2/2/4/3/3, far from any stacked order)—this suggests components weren't cleared/dropped properly, min-drop was 0 for many (no fall), or sorting failed, leading to static copy with minor bottom jumble; expected should have upper static rows, then fallen 7/8/9 groups stacking rigidly from bottom (e.g., 8s/9s dropping into lower rows without overlap, preserving shapes like vertical 7 strips but shifted down by column-min empties).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:57:26] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a gravity-based puzzle where the grid represents a 2D board (likely rows from top to bottom, with row 0 at the top), and non-background cells form connected "blobs" (4-directional connectivity of same or different numbers?) that fall downward independently after being cleared, stacking on top of existing structures or the bottom, simulating physics like in a match-3 or falling blocks game. The goal is to process blobs from bottom to top (highest row first) to apply gravity correctly without interference from lower blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common value in the grid, but in complex grids, ties or non-zero backgrounds might need handling (though not seen here).
 * Blobs are connected components of any non-background cells (not necessarily same number), using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal doesn't count, which is standard but easy to miss if 8-directional is assumed.
 * Blobs must be processed in order from lowest (highest row index, assuming row 0 is top) to highest to avoid upper blobs falling through cleared lower spaces incorrectly.
 * When computing drop distance for a blob, identify all columns it occupies, find the max row (lowest position) in that blob per column, then count consecutive background cells below it in the updated grid (after clearing previous blobs); take the MINIMUM drop across those columns to ensure the blob falls as a rigid unit without splitting.
 * After clearing a blob (set to background), drop it by the computed distance and place it in the new positions, but only if the new row < height; overhanging parts might be lost, but not seen in examples.
 * Subtlety: Dropping happens sequentially on a copy of the grid, so changes from lower blobs affect upper ones' drop calculations—processing bottom-up is crucial to simulate realistic gravity.
 * Blobs might overlap in columns after dropping, causing stacking; the min-drop ensures cohesion.
 * Grid is ragged in output (flattened rows), but input is 2D list; preserve width.
 * Easy to miss: Numbers within a blob can differ (e.g., 8,9 in same blob), so connectivity is by position, not value—blobs are groups of any non-background.
 * After all drops, unchanged top rows (all background) should remain as-is.
 * Potential edge: Empty grid or all background returns unchanged; single-cell blobs drop fully if possible.
 * In examples, some blobs seem to split or not connect properly, suggesting blob finding might over/under-connect based on value equality (but code doesn't require same value, which is good).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This correctly identifies background as mode; useful and bug-free.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    height = len(g)
    width = len(g[0]) if height > 0 else 0
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-dir, no diagonals
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != background:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j, g[i][j])]  # DFS stack for blob traversal
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y, num = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y, num))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != background:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny, g[nx][ny]))
                if blob:
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```
(This DFS-based blob finder is helpful for extracting connected non-background groups; stores position and value, which is key for later placement. It's correct in principle but may fail if blobs need same-value connectivity—examples suggest not.)

```python
def sort_blobs(blobs: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    def get_max_row(blob: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int:
        return max(i for i, _, _ in blob)
    return sorted(blobs, key=get_max_row, reverse=True)
```
(This sorts by lowest point of blob, processing bottom-up; essential for sequential gravity.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background and finds blobs via DFS, which works for connectivity, but fails to apply gravity properly in both training examples—blobs are cleared and dropped, but resulting positions don't match expected falling patterns (e.g., in Train 1, upper 8/9 blobs don't drop into cleared spaces correctly, leaving gaps or misplaced cells).
 * In Train 1, generated output keeps most top rows unchanged but mangles lower blobs (e.g., row 7 has a single 4 misplaced, row 8 has scattered 8/1/5 instead of consolidated drop); expected shows specific 8/9 groups dropping and reshaping, suggesting drop calculation ignores updated grid state or min-distance is wrong (unknown why, but drop_d seems too small or columns misidentified).
 * In Train 2, generated has excessive unchanged rows and blobs like 8/9 not dropping fully (e.g., row 16 has partial 8's, row 17 has fragmented 8/7/1); expected consolidates 8/9/2 into lower positions with proper stacking, indicating the sequential clearing/placing doesn't propagate space correctly—upper blobs fall as if lower ones weren't cleared.
 * compute_drop_distance finds min drop over blob columns based on max_i per col, which is good for rigid drop, but in practice overestimates obstacles (uses new_g after prior clears, but examples show it doesn't "see" the cleared space below).
 * place_blob only places if new_i < height, which is safe, but may clip blobs (not an issue here); however, it doesn't handle if drop causes overlap with uncleared lower blobs.
 * apply_gravity processes sorted_blobs but applies to a copy (new_g), which is correct, yet outputs show blobs not stacking—perhaps sorting reverse=True (bottom-first) is right, but drop calc assumes static below, missing chain reactions.
 * Overall, blob finding seems functional (captures groups like 8/9), but gravity simulation is broken: drops are minimal or zero for many, leading to near-identical grids; unhelpful if connectivity required same values (but code doesn't, and examples have mixed).
 * No unhelpful functions standout, but the full program integrates them poorly—e.g., no validation that blobs don't overlap post-drop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows many repetitive rows of [1,1,7,7,... ,2,2,7,7,... ,3,3] from row 2 onward, with scattered changes in lower rows (e.g., row 3 has 8/9 inserted oddly, row 6 has 3/4 misplaced, row 29 has 9/8/1 at end), but top rows are all 4's unchanged, suggesting minimal dropping happened.
 * Expected should simulate full gravity: identify blobs (e.g., 7's, 8/9 groups, 2's, 3's), clear bottom ones first (like lower 8/9/2), drop them to bottom (possibly stacking on 3's or filling to row ~29), then upper blobs (like top 7's) drop into those spaces; generated has no such consolidation—7's barely move, 8/9 fragments stay high, 2's static, indicating drop_distance computes 0 or 1 for most, ignoring cleared paths.
 * Differences: Generated keeps structure almost intact (e.g., row 12 has 2's in place, but expected would shift everything down); lower rows have artifacts like isolated 9/8 in row 29, unlike expected rigid blob falls; overall, it looks like partial/incomplete simulation, not matching physics where blobs should cascade down fully.
 * To handle test, need to ensure drop calc scans the entire column below max_i for background runs in the progressively updated grid; current min(ds) per blob is right in theory but fails in practice (perhaps bug in cols=set(j for _,j,_ in blob) missing multi-col spans, or while loop in compute_drop_distance stops prematurely).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 21:57:42] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Isolated elements**: Small standalone squares or dots in blue, cyan, yellow, or green, appearing in corners or mid-panels across both input and output.
- **Color palette**: Consistent use of primary/secondary hues (red, blue, yellow, orange, purple, cyan, green) for blocks, generalizing modular pixel art transformations.

[2025-10-01 21:59:33] Response:
### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only complete input-output pairs available), below is a list of **consistent interactions or connections** observed across **every example** (both Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to obvious, recurring relationships where one element clearly affects or connects to another (e.g., via position, color, holes, pixels, or transformation). I focused only on elements that appear and interact identically in **both** train examples, ignoring anything inconsistent, irrelevant (e.g., unique colors like Green or Dark Red small shapes that do not recur), or non-interactive (e.g., static elements without transformation). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted—only direct, evidence-based connections are noted. Where a specific mechanism (e.g., exact rule for change) is not clearly observable or consistent, it is called out as unknown.

Interactions are described as **component A → effect on component B** (or mutual if bidirectional), with evidence from both trains.

1. **Dividing bars (vertical/horizontal colored strips: Blue left, Yellow center/ left, Red right/top) → constrain positional transformations of small pixel shapes**  
   - The bars (e.g., Blue [0,0,1,12] pixels=26 in Train 1; Yellow [0,2,1,23] pixels=44 and Red [0,0,25,1] pixels=52 in Train 2) remain completely unchanged in position, pixels, and holes (always 0) between input and output.  
   - They define fixed panel boundaries, and all small pixel shapes (e.g., Maroon, Light Blue, Red 1-pixel) transform or move only **within or across panels bounded by these bars**, never overlapping or altering the bars themselves.  
   - Consistent evidence: In both trains, small shapes' bounding boxes (bbox) shift relative to bar positions (e.g., left-panel shapes stay left of center bar), but bars act as "walls" preventing expansion beyond panels. No exceptions.  
   - Unknown: Exact rule for cross-panel movement (e.g., why some shapes cross bars in Train 2 but not Train 1).

2. **Small pixel shapes (1-2 pixel isolated elements: Red, Yellow, Light Blue) → affect background panels' pixel count and hole count**  
   - These small shapes (always holes=0, pixels=1-2, colors: Red/Yellow/Light Blue singles or short bars) decrease in total pixel count (e.g., -3 in Train 1, -3 in Train 2) as they are partially or fully relocated/merged into background panels.  
   - This directly increases background pixel count by the exact same amount (+3 in both) and decreases background hole count (e.g., Orange holes=2→1 per panel in Train 1; Blue holes=4→2 in Train 2), conserving total grid pixels overall (338 in Train 1, 676 in Train 2).  
   - Position connection: Only small shapes **positioned inside a panel** (per dividing bars) affect that panel's background (e.g., left-panel Reds/Yellows merge into left Orange/Blue in both trains).  
   - Consistent evidence: Appears in every example; total small pixel loss matches background gain, and holes reduce proportionally to merged pixels (e.g., ~1-2 holes filled per 1-3 pixels added). Colors of small shapes do not change post-interaction (remain Red/Yellow/Light Blue in backgrounds implicitly).  
   - Unknown: Which specific small shape (e.g., a particular Red vs. Yellow) merges into which hole—positions suggest proximity, but not definitively consistent.

3. **Background panels (large areas: Orange/Blue with holes>0) ↔ small pixel shapes (Maroon multi-pixel blocks)**  
   - Backgrounds (holes=1-4, large bbox covering panels, pixels=114-442) have their hole count reduced and pixel count increased (as above), but Maroon shapes (holes=0, pixels=9-12, bbox ~4x4 to 6x4) do **not** lose pixels—instead, their positions transform relative to the background's fixed bbox.  
   - Mutual effect: Maroon bbox shifts (e.g., [4,4,7,7] → [7,3,9,7] in left panel Train 1; [15,3,19,5] → [5,17,8,21] in Train 2) always stay within the same or adjacent panel's background, suggesting Maroon "adapts" to background changes (e.g., avoiding filled holes). Pixel count of Maroon remains identical (e.g., 10 and 9 unchanged in Train 1; 11 and 12 in Train 2).  
   - Color/position connection: Maroon (consistent maroon color) only interacts with Orange/Blue backgrounds (not bars), and transformation aligns with panel divisions (e.g., one Maroon per panel in both trains).  
   - Consistent evidence: Two Maroon shapes per example; their bbox changes are always tied to background hole reductions in the same panel, with no pixel loss for Maroon itself (unlike 1-pixel shapes).  
   - Unknown: Precise transformation rule for Maroon bbox (e.g., rotation vs. shift)—changes are consistent in occurring but not in direction or scale across examples.

4. **Small pixel shapes (Light Blue 1-2 pixel elements) → positional transformation influenced by nearby Red/Yellow positions**  
   - Light Blue small shapes (holes=0, pixels=1-2, often vertical bbox like [9,5,9,6]) change position (e.g., [18,3,18,3] stays similar but [6,5,6,5] → [6,5,6,5] + new [6,7,6,7] in Train 1; [17,5,17,6] → [19,11,19,12] in Train 2), always ending up adjacent to (or overlapping bbox with) transformed Red/Yellow small shapes.  
   - Effect: Light Blue movement "follows" Red/Yellow positions post-transformation, maintaining short distances (e.g., 1-2 units in bbox coords) and same pixel count.  
   - Position/color connection: Only occurs near Red/Yellow (consistent colors); no interaction with Maroon or backgrounds directly. Confined to panel boundaries (per dividing bars).  
   - Consistent evidence: Light Blue always present (3-5 instances per example); every instance repositions next to a Red or Yellow in output, with no pixel/hole changes.  
   - Unknown: Direction of following (e.g., why upward in Train 1 but downward in Train 2)—proximity is consistent, but trigger (e.g., color priority) is not clear.

### Notes on Scope and Exclusions
- **Consistency filter**: Only elements/interactions appearing in **both** Train 1 and Train 2 are included (e.g., excluded Green/Dark Red small shapes as they are Train 2-only; excluded semantic "L-shapes" or "duck-like" as bbox data does not consistently show tetromino forms across examples). No forcing of non-obvious links (e.g., no color swaps observed consistently).
- **Irrelevant elements ignored**: Bars and backgrounds are static except when affected (as noted); isolated elements without changes (e.g., some Yellow bars) have no interactions. Test inputs were reviewed for recurrence but not used for patterns (no outputs provided).
- **Unknowns summary**: Exact transformation mechanics (e.g., rotation angles, merge priorities) cannot be explained from data alone—bbox/pixel changes are observable but rules are not consistent enough to specify beyond the listed effects. No total solution inferred.
- **Data basis**: Derived solely from provided lists (bbox for position, pixels/holes for properties); assumes 1D bbox [x1,y1,x2,y2] represents grid coords.

[2025-10-01 21:59:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only complete input-output pairs available), below is a list of **consistent interactions or connections** observed across **every example** (both Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to obvious, recurring relationships where one element clearly affects or connects to another (e.g., via position, color, holes, pixels, or transformation). I focused only on elements that appear and interact identically in **both** train examples, ignoring anything inconsistent, irrelevant (e.g., unique colors like Green or Dark Red small shapes that do not recur), or non-interactive (e.g., static elements without transformation). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted—only direct, evidence-based connections are noted. Where a specific mechanism (e.g., exact rule for change) is not clearly observable or consistent, it is called out as unknown.

Interactions are described as **component A → effect on component B** (or mutual if bidirectional), with evidence from both trains.

1. **Dividing bars (vertical/horizontal colored strips: Blue left, Yellow center/ left, Red right/top) → constrain positional transformations of small pixel shapes**  
   - The bars (e.g., Blue [0,0,1,12] pixels=26 in Train 1; Yellow [0,2,1,23] pixels=44 and Red [0,0,25,1] pixels=52 in Train 2) remain completely unchanged in position, pixels, and holes (always 0) between input and output.  
   - They define fixed panel boundaries, and all small pixel shapes (e.g., Maroon, Light Blue, Red 1-pixel) transform or move only **within or across panels bounded by these bars**, never overlapping or altering the bars themselves.  
   - Consistent evidence: In both trains, small shapes' bounding boxes (bbox) shift relative to bar positions (e.g., left-panel shapes stay left of center bar), but bars act as "walls" preventing expansion beyond panels. No exceptions.  
   - Unknown: Exact rule for cross-panel movement (e.g., why some shapes cross bars in Train 2 but not Train 1).

2. **Small pixel shapes (1-2 pixel isolated elements: Red, Yellow, Light Blue) → affect background panels' pixel count and hole count**  
   - These small shapes (always holes=0, pixels=1-2, colors: Red/Yellow/Light Blue singles or short bars) decrease in total pixel count (e.g., -3 in Train 1, -3 in Train 2) as they are partially or fully relocated/merged into background panels.  
   - This directly increases background pixel count by the exact same amount (+3 in both) and decreases background hole count (e.g., Orange holes=2→1 per panel in Train 1; Blue holes=4→2 in Train 2), conserving total grid pixels overall (338 in Train 1, 676 in Train 2).  
   - Position connection: Only small shapes **positioned inside a panel** (per dividing bars) affect that panel's background (e.g., left-panel Reds/Yellows merge into left Orange/Blue in both trains).  
   - Consistent evidence: Appears in every example; total small pixel loss matches background gain, and holes reduce proportionally to merged pixels (e.g., ~1-2 holes filled per 1-3 pixels added). Colors of small shapes do not change post-interaction (remain Red/Yellow/Light Blue in backgrounds implicitly).  
   - Unknown: Which specific small shape (e.g., a particular Red vs. Yellow) merges into which hole—positions suggest proximity, but not definitively consistent.

3. **Background panels (large areas: Orange/Blue with holes>0) ↔ small pixel shapes (Maroon multi-pixel blocks)**  
   - Backgrounds (holes=1-4, large bbox covering panels, pixels=114-442) have their hole count reduced and pixel count increased (as above), but Maroon shapes (holes=0, pixels=9-12, bbox ~4x4 to 6x4) do **not** lose pixels—instead, their positions transform relative to the background's fixed bbox.  
   - Mutual effect: Maroon bbox shifts (e.g., [4,4,7,7] → [7,3,9,7] in left panel Train 1; [15,3,19,5] → [5,17,8,21] in Train 2) always stay within the same or adjacent panel's background, suggesting Maroon "adapts" to background changes (e.g., avoiding filled holes). Pixel count of Maroon remains identical (e.g., 10 and 9 unchanged in Train 1; 11 and 12 in Train 2).  
   - Color/position connection: Maroon (consistent maroon color) only interacts with Orange/Blue backgrounds (not bars), and transformation aligns with panel divisions (e.g., one Maroon per panel in both trains).  
   - Consistent evidence: Two Maroon shapes per example; their bbox changes are always tied to background hole reductions in the same panel, with no pixel loss for Maroon itself (unlike 1-pixel shapes).  
   - Unknown: Precise transformation rule for Maroon bbox (e.g., rotation vs. shift)—changes are consistent in occurring but not in direction or scale across examples.

4. **Small pixel shapes (Light Blue 1-2 pixel elements) → positional transformation influenced by nearby Red/Yellow positions**  
   - Light Blue small shapes (holes=0, pixels=1-2, often vertical bbox like [9,5,9,6]) change position (e.g., [18,3,18,3] stays similar but [6,5,6,5] → [6,5,6,5] + new [6,7,6,7] in Train 1; [17,5,17,6] → [19,11,19,12] in Train 2), always ending up adjacent to (or overlapping bbox with) transformed Red/Yellow small shapes.  
   - Effect: Light Blue movement "follows" Red/Yellow positions post-transformation, maintaining short distances (e.g., 1-2 units in bbox coords) and same pixel count.  
   - Position/color connection: Only occurs near Red/Yellow (consistent colors); no interaction with Maroon or backgrounds directly. Confined to panel boundaries (per dividing bars).  
   - Consistent evidence: Light Blue always present (3-5 instances per example); every instance repositions next to a Red or Yellow in output, with no pixel/hole changes.  
   - Unknown: Direction of following (e.g., why upward in Train 1 but downward in Train 2)—proximity is consistent, but trigger (e.g., color priority) is not clear.

### Notes on Scope and Exclusions
- **Consistency filter**: Only elements/interactions appearing in **both** Train 1 and Train 2 are included (e.g., excluded Green/Dark Red small shapes as they are Train 2-only; excluded semantic "L-shapes" or "duck-like" as bbox data does not consistently show tetromino forms across examples). No forcing of non-obvious links (e.g., no color swaps observed consistently).
- **Irrelevant elements ignored**: Bars and backgrounds are static except when affected (as noted); isolated elements without changes (e.g., some Yellow bars) have no interactions. Test inputs were reviewed for recurrence but not used for patterns (no outputs provided).
- **Unknowns summary**: Exact transformation mechanics (e.g., rotation angles, merge priorities) cannot be explained from data alone—bbox/pixel changes are observable but rules are not consistent enough to specify beyond the listed effects. No total solution inferred.
- **Data basis**: Derived solely from provided lists (bbox for position, pixels/holes for properties); assumes 1D bbox [x1,y1,x2,y2] represents grid coords.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Training example 1 result: ERROR - Execution error: 

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Execution error: can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:10:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to preprocess and transform the grid by identifying a background color, detecting vertical dividing bars to split the grid into panels, and applying specific rules to merge small isolated shapes, shift maroon (color 8) shapes upward within panels, and reposition light blue (color 9) shapes relative to red/yellow (colors 2/4) in the same row. The transformations aim to normalize or consolidate elements for further puzzle solving, such as object extraction or pattern matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the flattened grid; assume it's 0 or similar neutral, but confirm via Counter.
 * Dividing bars are full-height vertical columns (or sequences of columns) of uniform non-background color; they must span the entire height (h rows) with no variation in that column.
 * Panels are rectangular regions between bars (from left=0 to w-1 if no bars); each panel is defined by (left_col, right_col, top=0, bottom=h-1), assuming no horizontal divisions.
 * Small shapes to merge: Isolated pixels or tiny groups (colors 2,4,9) with <=1 neighbor (in 4 directions, within panel bounds); count self + neighbors <=2 total pixels per group, but code checks per cell.
 * Merging: Up to 3 small pixels per panel are cleared to background, then "placed" (overwritten) in the bottom row starting from left of panel; this seems like consolidating small debris to the panel's bottom-left corner.
 * Maroon (8) transformation: Shift entire vertical stacks or blobs upward by up to 5 rows (min(shift, distance to panel top)) without overlapping existing cells; track moved positions to avoid double-shifts.
 * Light blue (9) repositioning: Move to immediately right of a red/yellow (2 or 4) in the same row within the panel if possible; if no such position, try right of first global red/yellow or leave in place; avoid overwriting.
 * Process order matters: Merge small shapes first, then shift maroon, then reposition light blue; apply transformations per panel to avoid cross-panel interference.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns unchanged; single panel if no bars; small panels may have no space for placements; neighbors only count same color and within panel; shifts avoid going above panel top.
 * Subtle: "Small shapes" may include diagonals or not (code uses 4-dir orthogonal); merging only up to 3 per panel, even if more exist; light blue move only if exact row match for target, else fallback.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal bars/divisions not handled (assumes vertical only); color 9 might be part of larger shapes, but code treats individually; background != small colors; errors if no red/yellow for repositioning.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using frequency count; useful as a starting point.)

```python
def identify_dividing_bars(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < w:
        col = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != background:
            start = c
            color = col[0]
            c += 1
            while c < w:
                col_next = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
                if len(set(col_next)) == 1 and col_next[0] == color:
                    c += 1
                else:
                    break
            end = c - 1
            bars.append((start, end, color))
        else:
            c += 1
    return bars
```
(This detects contiguous full-height vertical bars of uniform non-background color; helpful for splitting grid, but assumes no gaps in bar color.)

```python
def identify_panels(bars: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    if not bars:
        return [(0, w - 1, 0, h - 1)] if w > 0 and h > 0 else []
    panels = []
    left = 0
    for start, end, _ in bars:
        if left < start:
            panels.append((left, start - 1, 0, h - 1))
        left = end + 1
    if left < w:
        panels.append((left, w - 1, 0, h - 1))
    return panels
```
(This derives panels as regions between/around bars; core for localizing transformations, but fixed to full height.)

 * The single attempt implemented background detection, bar/panel identification, and the three main transformations (merge small, shift maroon, reposition light blue), showing partial understanding of core rules like panel isolation and color-specific moves.
 * What worked: Background finding via Counter is robust and likely correct; bar detection handles contiguous columns well; panel derivation correctly splits regions; small shape neighbor check (4-dir, within panel) captures isolation; maroon shift logic avoids overlap and respects panel bounds.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all examples—blank error on Train 1 (possibly index out-of-bounds or empty grid handling); tuple concatenation error on Train 2 and Test (traced to reposition_light_blue: unpacking `next(...)` (tuple) with `red_yellow_pos[0]` (tuple) but fallback `red_yellow_pos[0]` when next fails, causing (tuple, tuple) but error mentions "int", likely when red_yellow_pos empty or mismatched types like pc+1 as int in condition).
 * Merge_small_shapes partially works but may over-merge (collects all small pixels then takes [:3], but doesn't group true connected components—treats isolated cells only); placement overwrites bottom-left without checking if it's background or free.
 * Transform_maroon_shapes shifts per cell, not per connected blob, potentially fragmenting shapes; min(5, r - p_top) is good but doesn't handle horizontal extent of maroon.
 * Reposition_light_blue collects global red/yellow but tries per-panel; next() fallback to red_yellow_pos[0] causes type error if no matches (unpacking tuple with potentially int-mixed); doesn't handle multiple 9s or overwriting.
 * No object extraction function attempted (e.g., to identify full shapes post-transform); program assumes fixed colors (2=red,4=yellow,8=maroon,9=light blue) without verification.
 * Overall, syntax/logic bugs prevent any output; Train 1 error unknown but possibly empty panels or h/w=0; no observed generated grids to compare, so can't verify if transformations match expected (e.g., small shapes consolidated correctly).
 * Function merge_small_shapes is buggy (small_pixels collected but merged without connectivity, placement may overlap bars); transform_maroon_shapes is helpful but incomplete for blobs; reposition_light_blue is broken (type error, unclear fallback); identify_dividing_bars is solid but misses non-full-height bars if puzzle has partial ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple"), so no grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected transformed grid.
 * Without output, can't verify if it correctly merges small 2/4/9 pixels to bottom-left, shifts 8s up by <=5 rows per panel, or moves 9s right of 2/4 in-row; likely fails early in reposition_light_blue due to empty red_yellow_pos or next() unpacking.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Assuming test grid has background 0, vertical bars (e.g., color 1 or 5 full columns), panels with scattered small 2/4/9 (isolated, <=1 neighbor each), vertical 8 stacks, and 9s near but not adjacent to 2/4—output should have panels with smalls cleared and stacked at bottom-left (up to 3 colors preserved), 8s lifted up within panel tops, 9s shifted right to touch 2/4 in row; differs from error by actually producing a valid grid.
 * Error indicates unhandled case (no red/yellow for 9 repositioning), so test likely has panels without 2/4, causing fallback failure—must fix to leave 9s in place if no targets.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 22:10:13] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Observed Consistent Interconnections Across All Train Examples

Based on the provided train input/output pairs (the only complete examples for verifying consistency), I analyzed properties like color, holes, bounding boxes (positions/orientations), and pixel counts for potential interactions or effects. Only connections that appear in **every** train example (both pair 1 and pair 2) are listed below. I focused on obvious, direct relationships where one component or property consistently affects or transforms another (e.g., position changes leading to pixel transfers, or shape properties altering backgrounds). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone border colors without transformation) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear transformations (e.g., exact movement rules for individual small shapes like specific Maroon polyominoes swapping sides or reorienting) are noted as unknown rather than speculated. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided.

#### 1. **Small Shapes' Total Pixels → Background Pixels (Consistent Pixel Transfer)**
   - Small shapes (non-background elements like Maroon, Light Blue, Red, Yellow, Dark Red, Green singles or polyominoes, excluding borders/dividers) collectively decrease in total pixel count by exactly 3 between input and output.
   - This directly affects the large background shape(s) (Orange in train 1; Blue in train 2), which increase in total pixel count by exactly 3.
   - Interaction type: Apparent incorporation or transfer—pixels from small shapes are added to the background, altering its mass without changing its color or overall bounding box.
   - Consistent across both trains: No exceptions in pixel delta; occurs regardless of background color or number of backgrounds (1 or 2).
   - Note: Individual small shapes' pixel counts often remain unchanged (e.g., Maroon polyominoes keep 9-12 pixels), suggesting the transfer involves specific subsets of small pixels rather than entire shapes.

#### 2. **Background Holes → Reduction via Small Shape Interaction**
   - Large background shape(s) have their total hole count decreased by exactly 2 between input and output (train 1: 2+2=4 to 1+1=2; train 2: 4 to 2).
   - This is tied to the pixel transfer from small shapes (see #1), as the background pixel increase coincides with hole reduction, implying small shapes (or their pixels) fill or seal holes.
   - Interaction type: Hole count in backgrounds is modified by proximity or overlap potential with small shapes—small shapes positioned near/inside backgrounds in inputs lead to partial filling in outputs.
   - Consistent across both trains: Hole delta is always -2; tied to backgrounds only (small shapes have 0 holes consistently).
   - Note: Exact mechanism (e.g., which small shapes fill which holes) is unknown, as positions vary and no single small shape property (e.g., color or size) consistently predicts the fill.

#### 3. **Small Shapes' Positions → Transformation Across Sections**
   - Positions of small shapes (bounding boxes) change between input and output, often crossing sectional boundaries (e.g., left-to-right in train 1's vertical layout; upper-to-lower in train 2's horizontal layout).
   - This interacts with the central divider/boundary (Yellow in both trains), where shapes on one side of the divider in input appear on the opposite side in output for at least some instances (e.g., Maroon polyominoes cross in train 1; Reds and Dark Reds shift sections in train 2).
   - Interaction type: Position relative to divider triggers relocation or reorientation (e.g., horizontal to vertical bbox adjustments), but pixel count and color stay the same for the shape.
   - Consistent across both trains: At least 2-3 small shapes per example cross the divider; divider itself (Yellow, fixed bbox and 0 holes) remains unchanged and acts as the interaction pivot.
   - Note: Specific transformation rules (e.g., rotation angle or exact target position) are unknown and vary (e.g., some shapes like certain Light Blues stay in place); not all small shapes cross, but the divider consistently enables changes for those that do.

#### 4. **Border/Framing Elements → No Interaction (Static Anchors)**
   - Border bars (Blue/Red/Dark Red/Yellow/Green, single-column/row thickness) and dividers (Yellow central) maintain identical positions, colors, hole counts (0), and pixel counts between input and output.
   - They frame the composition but do not interact with or affect other elements—no changes observed, even as small shapes move near them.
   - Interaction type: Serve as static boundaries that constrain small shape movements (e.g., shapes do not cross outer borders, only internal dividers), but no transformative effect.
   - Consistent across both trains: All borders/dividers are unchanged; they enclose backgrounds and small shapes without alteration.
   - Note: Colors vary by puzzle orientation (vertical vs. horizontal), but the non-interactive framing role is consistent.

#### Additional Notes on Analysis
- **Colors as Connectors**: Color is preserved for individual small shapes and backgrounds during transformations (e.g., Maroon stays Maroon when moving; Orange/Blue backgrounds retain color), suggesting color links identity across input/output. However, no consistent color-to-position or color-to-hole effects (e.g., Light Blue does not always fill holes).
- **Irrelevant/Non-Interactive Elements**: Scattered single-pixel squares (e.g., isolated Yellow or Light Blue) sometimes stay static and do not affect others consistently—excluded as they lack cross-example interaction. Background silhouettes/edges do not consistently transform beyond hole/pixel changes.
- **Unknowns**: Detailed position-to-position mappings (e.g., why a Red at [5,8] moves to [21,4]) cannot be explained without forcing patterns; these are called unknown. No consistent shape-specific interactions (e.g., only Maroon interacts with dividers) hold across both trains, as other colors (Red, Dark Red) also move similarly in train 2.
- **Test Inputs**: Not used for consistency checks (no outputs provided), but they follow similar structures (e.g., multiple backgrounds with holes, small shapes inside frames), suggesting the same interconnections may apply.

This list captures only the obvious, verifiable connections without attempting to explain or solve the overall puzzle.

[2025-10-01 22:11:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Observed Consistent Interconnections Across All Train Examples

Based on the provided train input/output pairs (the only complete examples for verifying consistency), I analyzed properties like color, holes, bounding boxes (positions/orientations), and pixel counts for potential interactions or effects. Only connections that appear in **every** train example (both pair 1 and pair 2) are listed below. I focused on obvious, direct relationships where one component or property consistently affects or transforms another (e.g., position changes leading to pixel transfers, or shape properties altering backgrounds). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone border colors without transformation) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear transformations (e.g., exact movement rules for individual small shapes like specific Maroon polyominoes swapping sides or reorienting) are noted as unknown rather than speculated. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided.

#### 1. **Small Shapes' Total Pixels → Background Pixels (Consistent Pixel Transfer)**
   - Small shapes (non-background elements like Maroon, Light Blue, Red, Yellow, Dark Red, Green singles or polyominoes, excluding borders/dividers) collectively decrease in total pixel count by exactly 3 between input and output.
   - This directly affects the large background shape(s) (Orange in train 1; Blue in train 2), which increase in total pixel count by exactly 3.
   - Interaction type: Apparent incorporation or transfer—pixels from small shapes are added to the background, altering its mass without changing its color or overall bounding box.
   - Consistent across both trains: No exceptions in pixel delta; occurs regardless of background color or number of backgrounds (1 or 2).
   - Note: Individual small shapes' pixel counts often remain unchanged (e.g., Maroon polyominoes keep 9-12 pixels), suggesting the transfer involves specific subsets of small pixels rather than entire shapes.

#### 2. **Background Holes → Reduction via Small Shape Interaction**
   - Large background shape(s) have their total hole count decreased by exactly 2 between input and output (train 1: 2+2=4 to 1+1=2; train 2: 4 to 2).
   - This is tied to the pixel transfer from small shapes (see #1), as the background pixel increase coincides with hole reduction, implying small shapes (or their pixels) fill or seal holes.
   - Interaction type: Hole count in backgrounds is modified by proximity or overlap potential with small shapes—small shapes positioned near/inside backgrounds in inputs lead to partial filling in outputs.
   - Consistent across both trains: Hole delta is always -2; tied to backgrounds only (small shapes have 0 holes consistently).
   - Note: Exact mechanism (e.g., which small shapes fill which holes) is unknown, as positions vary and no single small shape property (e.g., color or size) consistently predicts the fill.

#### 3. **Small Shapes' Positions → Transformation Across Sections**
   - Positions of small shapes (bounding boxes) change between input and output, often crossing sectional boundaries (e.g., left-to-right in train 1's vertical layout; upper-to-lower in train 2's horizontal layout).
   - This interacts with the central divider/boundary (Yellow in both trains), where shapes on one side of the divider in input appear on the opposite side in output for at least some instances (e.g., Maroon polyominoes cross in train 1; Reds and Dark Reds shift sections in train 2).
   - Interaction type: Position relative to divider triggers relocation or reorientation (e.g., horizontal to vertical bbox adjustments), but pixel count and color stay the same for the shape.
   - Consistent across both trains: At least 2-3 small shapes per example cross the divider; divider itself (Yellow, fixed bbox and 0 holes) remains unchanged and acts as the interaction pivot.
   - Note: Specific transformation rules (e.g., rotation angle or exact target position) are unknown and vary (e.g., some shapes like certain Light Blues stay in place); not all small shapes cross, but the divider consistently enables changes for those that do.

#### 4. **Border/Framing Elements → No Interaction (Static Anchors)**
   - Border bars (Blue/Red/Dark Red/Yellow/Green, single-column/row thickness) and dividers (Yellow central) maintain identical positions, colors, hole counts (0), and pixel counts between input and output.
   - They frame the composition but do not interact with or affect other elements—no changes observed, even as small shapes move near them.
   - Interaction type: Serve as static boundaries that constrain small shape movements (e.g., shapes do not cross outer borders, only internal dividers), but no transformative effect.
   - Consistent across both trains: All borders/dividers are unchanged; they enclose backgrounds and small shapes without alteration.
   - Note: Colors vary by puzzle orientation (vertical vs. horizontal), but the non-interactive framing role is consistent.

#### Additional Notes on Analysis
- **Colors as Connectors**: Color is preserved for individual small shapes and backgrounds during transformations (e.g., Maroon stays Maroon when moving; Orange/Blue backgrounds retain color), suggesting color links identity across input/output. However, no consistent color-to-position or color-to-hole effects (e.g., Light Blue does not always fill holes).
- **Irrelevant/Non-Interactive Elements**: Scattered single-pixel squares (e.g., isolated Yellow or Light Blue) sometimes stay static and do not affect others consistently—excluded as they lack cross-example interaction. Background silhouettes/edges do not consistently transform beyond hole/pixel changes.
- **Unknowns**: Detailed position-to-position mappings (e.g., why a Red at [5,8] moves to [21,4]) cannot be explained without forcing patterns; these are called unknown. No consistent shape-specific interactions (e.g., only Maroon interacts with dividers) hold across both trains, as other colors (Red, Dark Red) also move similarly in train 2.
- **Test Inputs**: Not used for consistency checks (no outputs provided), but they follow similar structures (e.g., multiple backgrounds with holes, small shapes inside frames), suggesting the same interconnections may apply.

This list captures only the obvious, verifiable connections without attempting to explain or solve the overall puzzle.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 22:24:58] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def is_isolated(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            if g[nr][nc] != bg:
                return False
    return True

def transfer_pixels(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = get_background(g)
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if out[r][c] == 9 and not is_isolated(r, c, out, bg):
                out[r][c] = bg
    return out

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Compose rules: apply pixel transfer from small shapes (non-isolated 9's) to background
    # This handles the consistent pixel transfer (-3 small, +3 background) and contributes to hole reduction
    # Other rules (shape movement, static borders) are preserved in the input as base, with transfer applied
    return transfer_pixels(g)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:25:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformations on colored grids (likely representing images or patterns with numbers as colors), where rules govern pixel changes, shape movements, or mergers, often involving special values like 9 (possibly holes or temporary markers) interacting with backgrounds and other shapes. The goal is to apply consistent rules across examples to produce expected outputs, such as relocating or erasing elements while preserving borders and overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color, but transformations must preserve static borders (e.g., 1's, 4's) and not alter unrelated areas.
 * 9's appear to represent temporary or "hole" pixels that can be transferred, merged, or removed based on context: non-isolated 9's (adjacent to non-background) seem to blend into background or shapes, but isolated 9's may persist or move.
 * Shape movements or expansions: In training 1 expected, 8's expand or shift (e.g., row 2 has 8's where generated has 5's; row 3 has a 2 intrusion), suggesting rules for object propagation or filling holes rather than simple erasure.
 * Hole reduction: Comment in code mentions "hole reduction," but expected outputs show 9's relocating (e.g., training 1 row 3 has 9 in expected but not generated; training 2 has 9's in specific positions like row 11 col 19).
 * Subtle element: Connectivity matters—diagonal or full 8-directional adjacency might be needed for "isolation," as 4-directional (used in code) misses some interactions (e.g., training 2 generated keeps some 8's/9's isolated incorrectly).
 * Color-specific rules: 9's interact with specific shapes (e.g., 8's in training 1, 2's/8's in training 2), not just background; over-generalizing to all non-bg neighbors fails when shapes like 2 or 3 intrude.
 * Grid consistency: Outputs must match exact positions; small mismatches (e.g., a single 5 vs. 8) indicate rule gaps, like failing to handle multi-step transfers or conditional movements based on neighboring shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Preserve "divider" or border elements (e.g., 4's in training 2 rows 2-23); don't flood entire areas; account for vertical/horizontal asymmetries in shapes.
 * All attempts so far focus on 9-to-bg transfer, but ignore shape relocation (e.g., 8's moving right/down in expected vs. static in generated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, used in both trainings and test; essential for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def is_isolated(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Note: May need 8 directions for full connectivity
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            if g[nr][nc] != bg:
                return False
    return True
```
(This checks 4-directional isolation of 9's from non-background; helpful but limited—subtleties like diagonal connections may require expansion; used to avoid changing isolated 9's, which persists some correctly but misses mergers.)

```python
def transfer_pixels(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = get_background(g)
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if out[r][c] == 9 and not is_isolated(r, c, out, bg):
                out[r][c] = bg
    return out
```
(This applies the core transfer logic; partially helpful for non-isolated 9's but broken for cases needing movement instead of erasure, as seen in trainings.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on erasing non-isolated 9's to background, which worked partially for reducing some "small shapes" but failed to relocate or expand other elements (e.g., 8's static in generated vs. shifted in expected).
 * Training 1: Generated erased some 9's correctly (e.g., row 6 col 9 stays 9 as isolated?), but mismatched by keeping 5's where expected has 8's/2's (e.g., row 2 all 5's vs. expected 8's in row 2; row 3 has 9 at col 18 in generated but expected has 8's and 9 elsewhere; unknown why 8-shapes didn't propagate).
 * Training 1: Missed hole filling or shape intrusion (e.g., expected row 4 has 9 at col 18, but generated has it at col 18 unchanged? Wait, generated row 3 col 18 is 9, but expected row 3 has 8's/2; differences in 8-blob positions and a 4/9 mismatch in row 4).
 * Training 2: Generated erased some 9's (e.g., row 18 col 6 becomes 1? but expected has 8's moving), but kept invalid 8's/2's (e.g., row 5 has 8's where expected has all 1's; row 11 has 2's/9 where expected relocates them; row 17 has 8's in generated vs. expected 1's with 8's lower).
 * Training 2: Failed to collapse or move shapes upward/downward (e.g., expected simplifies upper rows to 1's, but generated retains scattered 8's/2's; unknown reason for not detecting multi-pixel "small shapes").
 * Overall: No training passed; attempt demonstrates partial understanding of 9's as transferable but ignores broader rules like shape adjacency mergers or position-specific changes; is_isolated is helpful but too narrow (4-dir vs. 8-dir?).
 * No object extraction attempted yet, but would be essential for identifying "small shapes" beyond single 9's (e.g., connected components of 8's/9's).
 * transfer_pixels is partially helpful for bg blending but not for the puzzle's apparent "movement" or "filling" mechanics; don't rely solely on it without shape detection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies the same 9-to-bg erasure as trainings, changing scattered 9's (e.g., row 19 col 8 to 7?, row 20 col 20 to 7?, row 25 col 4 to 7?, row 26 col 5 to 7?) but leaves shapes like 8's and 3's intact without apparent movement or expansion.
 * Unlike trainings, test has more 9's in lower rows (e.g., rows 25-29), but output erases non-isolated ones without addressing potential shape interactions (e.g., 8's in row 3 col 4-5 stay, but if rules involve propagation like in training 1 expected, they should shift).
 * Output mismatches likely expected by over-simplifying: e.g., row 6 has 1/4/8's unchanged, but puzzles may require filling holes with adjacent colors (7's?); background seems 7 (common), but 4's/1's/2's/3's persist without merger, suggesting incomplete rules.
 * No sense of "correctness" without expected, but based on training failures, this likely errs by not handling 8/9 clusters as movable objects (e.g., the 8-blob in rows 3-5 cols 4-8 may need to expand rightward like training 1's 8's).

[2025-10-01 22:25:49] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 22:27:30] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), I analyzed the elements for consistent interactions or effects across **both** train cases. Only obvious, direct connections that appear in **every** example are listed below. I focused on properties like color, holes, bounding box (position/size), and pixel count that show repeated cause-effect relationships or transformations between input and output. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone dividers with no changes) are excluded unless they interact with others. Inconsistent or unclear interactions (e.g., exact movement rules for small shapes, which vary in direction or target) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing assumptions. Tests were not used for identification, as they lack outputs for verification.

#### 1. **Large Background Shapes (e.g., Orange in Train 1, Blue in Train 2) ↔ Hole Count and Pixel Count**
   - **Description**: Large, multi-pixel area-filling shapes (high pixel count, spanning full height/width of sections, with initial holes >0) consistently interact with their own structural properties.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Hole count decreases (from 2 to 1 in Train 1 for both Oranges; from 4 to 2 in Train 2 for Blue), while pixel count increases slightly (Orange: +1 to +2; Blue: +3). This suggests an internal transformation where enclosed voids are partially filled, but the exact mechanism (e.g., what triggers the fill) is unknown and consistent only in the net change, not the specifics.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in both trains; no exceptions. Bounding boxes remain unchanged, indicating position is stable while internal properties evolve.
   - **Related Properties**: Holes → pixel count (negative correlation: fewer holes, more pixels).

#### 2. **Small Single-Pixel Dots (e.g., Light Blue/Blue, Red) ↔ Large Background Shapes**
   - **Description**: Small, 1-pixel components (often Light Blue, Blue, or Red, positioned inside or adjacent to large background shapes) that are standalone and contrasting in color.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These dots disappear from their input positions in the output and correlate with changes in the large shapes' holes/pixels (e.g., two 1-pixel Blues inside right Orange in Train 1 input vanish, aligning with Orange's hole reduction; multiple small Reds/Light Blues near Blue in Train 2 input are absent, aligning with Blue's hole reduction). The dots do not reappear in the same form, suggesting they are absorbed or contribute to filling.
   - **Consistency**: Present in both trains; the disappearance consistently ties to large shape changes, but the precise absorption rule (e.g., color matching or position threshold) is unknown.
   - **Related Properties**: Position (inside bbox of large shape) → disappearance; color (contrasting to background) → effect on holes/pixels of large shape.

#### 3. **Maroon Small-to-Medium Shapes (e.g., 5-12 pixels) ↔ Position Relative to Dividers**
   - **Description**: Compact Maroon polyomino-like shapes (irregular bounding boxes, low holes=0, moderate pixels) positioned within or near divider sections.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These shapes undergo positional shifts in the output (e.g., Train 1: Maroon [4,4,7,7] moves/expands to [7,3,9,7] and [17,2,20,5]; Train 2: Maroon [15,3,19,5] shifts to [17,12,21,14], [9,11,13,14] to [5,17,8,21]). Pixel count stays similar or exact (±1), but bounding boxes adjust horizontally/vertically toward central or lower sections. This indicates a transformation driven by proximity to dividers.
   - **Consistency**: All Maroon shapes in both trains show positional change without color or hole alteration; no Maroon remains static.
   - **Related Properties**: Position (y-coordinate increases or x shifts toward center) → new bbox; no effect on pixels/holes, which remain stable.

#### 4. **Yellow Horizontal/Vertical Bars ↔ Unchanged Stability (No Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Thin, full-span Yellow bars (e.g., vertical [12,0,13,12] in Train 1; vertical left [0,2,1,23] and horizontal elements in Train 2).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These bars show no transformation; bounding boxes, pixels, holes, and color are identical in input and output. They do not affect or get affected by other elements, serving as static boundaries.
   - **Consistency**: Identical in both trains; however, since no interaction occurs, this is noted only as a baseline for sectional division (e.g., other elements' positions reference these without altering them).
   - **Related Properties**: Position → no change; used implicitly for sectioning but no direct effect.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Interactions
- **Small Multi-Pixel Shapes (e.g., Light Blue 2-4 pixels, Yellow 2-3 pixels)**: These reposition or split consistently (e.g., Light Blue [17,5,17,6] stays similar in Train 1 but shifts in Train 2), but the target position varies (sometimes up, sometimes down/right), making the transformation rule unknown. Color remains the same, but no clear effect on other components.
- **Dark Red/Green Elements**: Appear in Train 2 (and tests, but not analyzed), with minor pixel additions (e.g., new 1-pixel Dark Red/Green), but no repeatable connection to inputs across both trains (absent in Train 1).
- **Color-to-Color Effects**: Potential links (e.g., Light Blue near Blue backgrounds) appear in both but cannot be explained as causal (e.g., no consistent color change); treated as unknown.
- **Overall Mirroring/Sectional Effects**: Bounding boxes suggest left-right or top-bottom influences (e.g., shapes near left dividers move rightward), but not consistent in direction or trigger across both trains.

No other connections (e.g., hole count to color, specific shape silhouettes to movement) are obvious and consistent in every example. If more examples were provided, additional patterns might emerge, but based on these, the above are the only clear, repeated interactions.

Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), I analyzed the elements for consistent interactions or effects across **both** train cases. Only obvious, direct connections that appear in **every** example are listed below. I focused on properties like color, holes, bounding box (position/size), and pixel count that show repeated cause-effect relationships or transformations between input and output. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone dividers with no changes) are excluded unless they interact with others. Inconsistent or unclear interactions (e.g., exact movement rules for small shapes, which vary in direction or target) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing assumptions. Tests were not used for identification, as they lack outputs for verification.

#### 1. **Large Background Shapes (e.g., Orange in Train 1, Blue in Train 2) ↔ Hole Count and Pixel Count**
   - **Description**: Large, multi-pixel area-filling shapes (high pixel count, spanning full height/width of sections, with initial holes >0) consistently interact with their own structural properties.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Hole count decreases (from 2 to 1 in Train 1 for both Oranges; from 4 to 2 in Train 2 for Blue), while pixel count increases slightly (Orange: +1 to +2; Blue: +3). This suggests an internal transformation where enclosed voids are partially filled, but the exact mechanism (e.g., what triggers the fill) is unknown and consistent only in the net change, not the specifics.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in both trains; no exceptions. Bounding boxes remain unchanged, indicating position is stable while internal properties evolve.
   - **Related Properties**: Holes → pixel count (negative correlation: fewer holes, more pixels).

#### 2. **Small Single-Pixel Dots (e.g., Light Blue/Blue, Red) ↔ Large Background Shapes**
   - **Description**: Small, 1-pixel components (often Light Blue, Blue, or Red, positioned inside or adjacent to large background shapes) that are standalone and contrasting in color.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These dots disappear from their input positions in the output and correlate with changes in the large shapes' holes/pixels (e.g., two 1-pixel Blues inside right Orange in Train 1 input vanish, aligning with Orange's hole reduction; multiple small Reds/Light Blues near Blue in Train 2 input are absent, aligning with Blue's hole reduction). The dots do not reappear in the same form, suggesting they are absorbed or contribute to filling.
   - **Consistency**: Present in both trains; the disappearance consistently ties to large shape changes, but the precise absorption rule (e.g., color matching or position threshold) is unknown.
   - **Related Properties**: Position (inside bbox of large shape) → disappearance; color (contrasting to background) → effect on holes/pixels of large shape.

#### 3. **Maroon Small-to-Medium Shapes (e.g., 5-12 pixels) ↔ Position Relative to Dividers**
   - **Description**: Compact Maroon polyomino-like shapes (irregular bounding boxes, low holes=0, moderate pixels) positioned within or near divider sections.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These shapes undergo positional shifts in the output (e.g., Train 1: Maroon [4,4,7,7] moves/expands to [7,3,9,7] and [17,2,20,5]; Train 2: Maroon [15,3,19,5] shifts to [17,12,21,14], [9,11,13,14] to [5,17,8,21]). Pixel count stays similar or exact (±1), but bounding boxes adjust horizontally/vertically toward central or lower sections. This indicates a transformation driven by proximity to dividers.
   - **Consistency**: All Maroon shapes in both trains show positional change without color or hole alteration; no Maroon remains static.
   - **Related Properties**: Position (y-coordinate increases or x shifts toward center) → new bbox; no effect on pixels/holes, which remain stable.

#### 4. **Yellow Horizontal/Vertical Bars ↔ Unchanged Stability (No Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Thin, full-span Yellow bars (e.g., vertical [12,0,13,12] in Train 1; vertical left [0,2,1,23] and horizontal elements in Train 2).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These bars show no transformation; bounding boxes, pixels, holes, and color are identical in input and output. They do not affect or get affected by other elements, serving as static boundaries.
   - **Consistency**: Identical in both trains; however, since no interaction occurs, this is noted only as a baseline for sectional division (e.g., other elements' positions reference these without altering them).
   - **Related Properties**: Position → no change; used implicitly for sectioning but no direct effect.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Interactions
- **Small Multi-Pixel Shapes (e.g., Light Blue 2-4 pixels, Yellow 2-3 pixels)**: These reposition or split consistently (e.g., Light Blue [17,5,17,6] stays similar in Train 1 but shifts in Train 2), but the target position varies (sometimes up, sometimes down/right), making the transformation rule unknown. Color remains the same, but no clear effect on other components.
- **Dark Red/Green Elements**: Appear in Train 2 (and tests, but not analyzed), with minor pixel additions (e.g., new 1-pixel Dark Red/Green), but no repeatable connection to inputs across both trains (absent in Train 1).
- **Color-to-Color Effects**: Potential links (e.g., Light Blue near Blue backgrounds) appear in both but cannot be explained as causal (e.g., no consistent color change); treated as unknown.
- **Overall Mirroring/Sectional Effects**: Bounding boxes suggest left-right or top-bottom influences (e.g., shapes near left dividers move rightward), but not consistent in direction or trigger across both trains.

No other connections (e.g., hole count to color, specific shape silhouettes to movement) are obvious and consistent in every example. If more examples were provided, additional patterns might emerge, but based on these, the above are the only clear, repeated interactions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:39:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal appears to be cleaning up or reconstructing a scene by identifying a dominant color (likely the background or main element), filling small non-dominant components within its bounding box, and repositioning specific elements like maroon (color 8) toward a central area, while preserving key structures like borders, objects, and anomalies (e.g., 9s as special markers). The process aims to match expected "clean" or "corrected" grids that maintain object shapes, positions, and details without over-filling or mis-shifting elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Dominant color (e.g., 5 in Train 1, 1 or 4 in Train 2, 7 in test) must be accurately identified as the most common non-background color, but not over-applied to erase important small features like isolated 9s, thin borders (e.g., color 4 lines), or object details.
 * Bounding box should tightly enclose the dominant color's main area to avoid processing irrelevant parts of the grid, but must handle irregular shapes without excluding connected components.
 * Small components (< threshold, e.g., 10 cells) of non-dominant colors inside the bbox should be filled with dominant color only if they are noise/holes; do not fill structural elements like borders (4), object protrusions (e.g., 8 clusters), or anomalies (9s, which seem to represent eyes or special points that must remain).
 * Maroon (8) elements represent objects (e.g., perhaps a character or shape) that need repositioning toward the grid's center, but the shift must be precise (not a fixed 5-column right shift, as it overwrites and misplaces them); consider vertical/horizontal centering based on bbox or grid midpoint, and avoid clearing originals to background (0) if they overlap other elements.
 * Preserve borders and frames (e.g., 1s on sides, 4s as dividers) without alteration, as they define the puzzle structure; top/bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s) are often uniform backgrounds that should not be touched.
 * Anomalies like 9s are rare and must stay in place as they likely indicate key features (e.g., eyes in a face); 0s are empty/neutral spaces to fill selectively, but not all (e.g., larger gaps might be intentional).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 13x26 in Train 1, 26x26 in Train 2, 30x28 in test), so functions must handle rectangular inputs dynamically; connected components should use 4-directional adjacency, but only within bbox to avoid global flooding.
 * Subtle elements: In Train 1, expected output repositions 8s into a more central blob with 9s intact, without filling internal 0s prematurely; in Train 2, small 8/9 clusters and 2s must form specific patterns (e.g., a face or symbol) without being erased. Over-shifting 8s can collide with other colors, creating mismatches.
 * Threshold for "small" components needs tuning (10 may be too low, missing medium noise); do not fill if component touches bbox edges, as it might be a border extension.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes object recognition (e.g., extracting blobs of 8s as movable entities) over blind filling, with rules favoring preservation of visual motifs like symmetry or alignment.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_dominant_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most frequent color, useful for background/main element; works in all examples as 5, 1/4-ish, 7.)

```python
def get_bounding_box(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    cols = len(g[0])
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = rows, -1, cols, -1
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == color:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)
                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This computes a tight bbox for the dominant color, essential for local processing; accurate but needs to handle empty bbox gracefully.)

```python
def fill_small_components(g: List[List[int]], dominant: int, bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], threshold: int = 10) -> List[List[int]]:
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
    if max_r < min_r:
        return out
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = set()
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if (r, c) not in visited and g[r][c] != dominant:
                component = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited.add((r, c))
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
                        if (min_r <= nr <= max_r and min_c <= nc <= max_c and
                            0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited and g[nr][nc] != dominant):
                            visited.add((nr, nc))
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if len(component) < threshold:
                    for pr, pc in component:
                        out[pr][pc] = dominant
    return out
```
(This performs DFS-based connected component filling within bbox, helpful for noise removal; works partially but over-fills non-noise like 9s or small 8 parts; threshold=10 is a starting point but needs exceptions for special colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies dominant color and bbox in all cases, and fills some small 0/9 holes appropriately (e.g., scattered 0s in Train 1 rows 4-7 become 5s in generated, matching expected in parts).
 * Fill_small_components works for tiny noise (e.g., isolated 0s in Train 2) but fails on medium components or specials: in Train 1, it incorrectly fills some 8-adjacent 0s and leaves 9s unfilled when they should stay; in Train 2, it erases small 2/9 clusters (e.g., row 11 generated has no 2s where expected has them) and over-fills 8s prematurely.
 * move_maroon_toward_center is broken/unhelpful: fixed 5-column right shift misplaces 8s entirely (e.g., Train 1 generated shifts 8s in rows 4-10 rightward into 5s/0s, creating smears not in expected; Train 2 scatters 8s into borders, losing shape); it clears originals to 0, which introduces new holes, and ignores vertical centering or collision detection.
 * Overall, attempt understands component-based cleaning but misses subtlety of preserving object integrity (8s as movable blobs, 9s as fixed points) and precise repositioning; Train 1 generated mismatches expected in 8/9 placements (e.g., expected row 2 has 8s at cols 17-20, generated has them elsewhere; unknown why 8s aren't clustered centrally) and row 8 has extra 1s/0s; Train 2 mismatches in lower half (e.g., expected rows 17-23 have specific 8/9 patterns for a shape, generated fills them with 1s/0s).
 * No object extraction function present, but one would be essential to identify and relocate 8-blobs as units (e.g., find connected 8 components, compute their centroid, shift to grid center).
 * Program copies grid correctly and uses neutral 0, but doesn't handle multi-dominant areas (e.g., Train 2 has competing 1/4) or edge cases like 8s outside bbox.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it over-fills with dominant 7 across most of the grid (e.g., rows 7-30 are nearly uniform 7s with side 1/2/3 borders), erasing likely object details like clustered 8s/9s/4s (e.g., row 5 has 8s scattered and partially filled, but expected probably preserves a central 8-shape with 9-eyes intact, similar to Train 1/2 patterns).
 * Small components like 0/9 in rows 3-6 (e.g., 9 at row 5 col 5) are filled or ignored incorrectly, creating solid 7 blocks where holes/eyes should remain; 8s in rows 3-12 are shifted/misplaced (e.g., row 9 has 8s at end, but likely should be centered without overwriting 7s).
 * Borders (1s left, 3s right, 4s top) are preserved somewhat, but internal structures (e.g., row 6's 3/4 anomalies) are lost to 7-filling, mismatched from trainings where such details stay; the uniform lower rows suggest over-aggressive filling without bbox limiting or object protection.
 * No clear central repositioning of 8s (they're smeared right/down), and extra 0s persist in places (e.g., row 9 cols 20-22), indicating the shift function failed similarly to trainings; overall, it looks like a "washed out" version missing the visual puzzle's key elements (e.g., a face or symbol formed by 8/9).

- **Structure**: Five vertical color strips (left to right: blue, orange, yellow, orange, red) forming a divided grid, consistent across input/output panels; a central yellow divider separates left (input) and right (output) sides.
- **Shapes (generalized)**: Abstract polyomino-like forms (e.g., L-shapes, T-shapes, squares, irregular clusters) composed of 2-5 connected blocks, positioned within orange strips; vary in orientation, size, and color per panel.
- **Colors (blocks)**: Primary shapes use magenta/purple (dominant), cyan/blue (accents), red (bases/edges), yellow (small details); background strips remain solid orange/yellow without intrusion.
- **Positions**: Left orange strip hosts 1-2 shapes (e.g., stacked or adjacent); right orange strip mirrors with transformed variants (e.g., rotated, recolored, or reassembled); no elements in blue/red/yellow strips except borders.
- **Variations (input to output)**: Input features upright/inverted forms with cyan highlights; output shows rotated/flipped versions with added yellow/red extensions; third panel (example?) uses purple/green bases with blue/cyan shapes in a taller grid format.

[2025-10-01 22:39:25] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 22:41:54] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all examples (train input 1, train output 1, train input 2, train output 2, test input 1, test input 2), I identified only interactions and connections that are obvious, directly observable in the bounding boxes, pixel counts, hole counts, colors, and positions, and appear **in every single one** without exception. I ignored any high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., standalone strip colors without interaction, unique one-off shapes like isolated Greens or Dark Reds that don't connect consistently), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., hole reductions only in train outputs, not inputs; color shifts that vary). No attempts to explain or hypothesize transformations—only direct, consistent links between properties/components. If a potential connection (e.g., specific position-to-color mapping) wasn't uniform across all six lists, it was excluded as unknown or inconsistent. Elements without clear, repeated interaction (e.g., Blue small shapes appear in some but not all; Orange canvas only in train 1) were omitted.

#### 1. **Canvas Area (Large Blob) ↔ Shapes (Pixel Count Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The large canvas blob (e.g., Orange in train 1, Blue in train 2, Dark Red in tests; always a single dominant area per side/panel with bbox spanning most of the inner grid, holes ≥0, pixels >> small shapes) has its pixel count directly and inversely connected to the total pixel count of all shapes placed within its bbox. Specifically: `canvas_pixels + sum_of_shape_pixels_within_bbox ≈ full_bbox_area` (calculated as (maxx - minx + 1) × (maxy - miny + 1)), with near-exact matches accounting for minor boundary overlaps.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train input 1 left (Orange [2,0,11,12], 10×13=130 area, 114 pixels) + shapes within (16 pixels) = 130.
     - Train input 1 right (Orange [14,0,23,12], 130 area, 115 pixels) + shapes within (≈15 pixels) = ≈130.
     - Train output 1 left (Orange [2,0,11,12], 130 area, 116 pixels) + shapes within (≈14 pixels) = ≈130.
     - Train output 1 right (Orange [14,0,23,12], 130 area, 116 pixels) + shapes within (≈14 pixels) = ≈130.
     - Train input 2 (Blue [2,2,23,23], 22×22=484 area, 442 pixels) + shapes within (42 pixels) = 484.
     - Train output 2 (Blue [2,2,23,23], 484 area, 445 pixels) + shapes within (39 pixels) = 484.
     - Test input 1 left (Dark Red [2,2,13,29], 12×28=336 area, 306 pixels) + shapes within (30 pixels) = 336.
     - Test input 1 right (Dark Red [16,2,25,29], 10×28=280 area, 250 pixels) + shapes within (30 pixels) = 280.
     - Test input 2 (No single large canvas blob listed, but aggregated Dark Red pieces [2,12,15,13] + [10,19,12,19] + [7,24,7,24] span inner area; however, partial overlap with shapes confirms inverse pixel relation in sub-areas, e.g., near-bottom Dark Red pixels reduced by adjacent Maroon/Light Blue placements).
   - **Properties Involved**: Canvas pixels, shape pixels, bbox dimensions (position/size of canvas constrains shape placement).
   - **Note**: This is purely additive/subtractive; no color or hole interaction here, as those vary.

#### 2. **Canvas Area (Holes) ↔ Shapes (Position and Clustering Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The hole count of the canvas blob is affected by the positions and clustering of shapes within its bbox—specifically, when 2+ small shapes (Light Blue or Yellow, 1-4 pixels) are positioned adjacent (overlapping or sharing bbox edges, e.g., Δx/Δy ≤1) to a Maroon cluster (≥5 pixels), it consistently correlates with canvas holes ≥1. Isolated shapes (no adjacency) do not trigger this; holes represent enclosed voids in canvas connectivity caused by clustered shape placements.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train input 1 left (holes=2): Maroon [4,4,7,7] adjacent to Light Blue [6,5,6,5] (overlaps y5, Δx=2) and [9,5,9,6] (shares y5-6 edge).
     - Train input 1 right (holes=2): Maroon [17,8,21,10] adjacent to Light Blue [18,10,19,10] (overlaps x18-19, y10).
     - Train output 1 left (holes=1): Maroon [7,3,9,7] adjacent to Light Blue [9,5,9,6] (shares x9, y5-6).
     - Train output 1 right (holes=1): Maroon [17,2,20,5] adjacent to Light Blue [18,3,18,3] (Δx=1-2, y3).
     - Train input 2 (holes=4): Maroon [15,3,19,5] adjacent to Light Blue [17,5,17,6] (overlaps x17, y5); second Maroon [9,11,13,14] adjacent to Light Blue [11,13,11,13] (overlaps x11, y13); additional clusters with Yellow [14,4,14,5] (overlaps x14? adjacent to first Maroon) and [10,15,12,15] (near second).
     - Train output 2 (holes=2): Maroon [17,12,21,14] adjacent to Light Blue [19,11,19,12] (Δx=2, shares y12); second Maroon [5,17,8,21] adjacent to Light Blue [6,19,6,19] (overlaps x6, y19).
     - Test input 1 left (holes=4): Maroon [6,3,7,5] adjacent to Light Blue [5,4,5,4] (Δx=1, y4); Maroon [3,3,4,5] adjacent to Yellow [2,5,2,5] (Δx=1, y5); Maroon [9,8,11,10] adjacent to Light Blue [9,9,9,9] (overlaps x9, y9) and [10,8,10,8] (adjacent x10, y8).
     - Test input 1 right (holes=1): Maroon [18,6,24,11] adjacent to Light Blue [21,6,22,7] (overlaps x21-22, y6-7).
     - Test input 2 (holes=1 in Maroon [8,23,13,25], acting as partial canvas): Adjacent to Light Blue [10,24,10,24] (overlaps x10, y24) and [5,24,5,25] (Δx=3-5 but clustered with Maroon [5,5,5,7] higher up via chain).
   - **Properties Involved**: Canvas holes, shape positions (bbox coords), shape clustering (adjacency via Δx/Δy or overlap), limited to Maroon + (Light Blue or Yellow).
   - **Note**: Red small shapes (1-2 pixels) sometimes adjacent but do not consistently trigger holes (e.g., isolated in train 1); excluded as inconsistent. Hole values vary (1-4), but the adjacency trigger is uniform.

#### 3. **Maroon Clusters ↔ Small Light Blue/Yellow (Position Adjacency Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Maroon clusters (always 5-18 pixels, irregular bbox spanning 2-6 units) consistently have 1-2 small Light Blue or Yellow shapes (1-4 pixels, single-column bbox) positioned adjacent to or overlapping their bbox edges, affecting the overall shape silhouette (e.g., extending the effective bbox by 1-2 units in x or y). This adjacency is preserved in configuration (not exact position) across panels.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train input 1 left: Maroon [4,4,7,7] adjacent/overlaps Light Blue [6,5] (internal) and [9,5,9,6] (right edge x7→9).
     - Train input 1 right: Maroon [17,8,21,10] overlaps Light Blue [18,10,19,10] (bottom edge).
     - Train output 1 left: Maroon [7,3,9,7] adjacent to Light Blue [9,5,9,6] (right edge x9).
     - Train output 1 right: Maroon [17,2,20,5] adjacent to Light Blue [18,3] (internal-ish).
     - Train input 2: Maroon [15,3,19,5] adjacent to Yellow [14,4,14,5] (left edge x15→14) and Light Blue [17,5,17,6] (bottom); Maroon [9,11,13,14] adjacent to Light Blue [11,13] (internal).
     - Train output 2: Maroon [17,12,21,14] adjacent to Yellow [16,12,16,13] (left) and Light Blue [19,11,19,12] (bottom); Maroon [5,17,8,21] adjacent to Yellow [4,18,4,20] (left).
     - Test input 1 left: Maroon [6,3,7,5] adjacent to Light Blue [5,4] (left/top); Maroon [3,3,4,5] adjacent to Yellow [2,5] (left); Maroon [9,8,11,10] adjacent to Yellow [10,7] (top, Δy=1) and Light Blue [10,8] + [9,9] (internal).
     - Test input 1 right: Maroon [18,6,24,11] adjacent to Light Blue [21,6,22,7] (internal).
     - Test input 2: Maroon [5,5,5,7] adjacent to Light Blue [5,4] (top); Maroon [6,6,8,9] adjacent to Light Blue [6,6,7,7] (overlaps); Maroon [10,16,12,18] adjacent to Light Blue [11,16,11,17] (internal); Maroon [8,23,13,25] adjacent to Light Blue [10,24] (internal).
   - **Properties Involved**: Maroon bbox (edges), small shape bbox (position relative to edges), pixels (small shapes always ≤4, Maroon ≥5).
   - **Note**: This does not include Red small shapes (inconsistent adjacency, e.g., isolated Reds in train 1 left). No direct color change or transformation explained—positions shift, but adjacency persists.

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Connections
- Position → Color (e.g., y=5 often Light Blue in train 1, but varies to Red/Yellow in train 2/tests; not uniform).
- Hole Count → Specific Shape Transform (e.g., holes=2 in train 1 vs. 4 in train 2 lead to different pixel shifts; cannot explain consistently).
- Specific Shape Silhouette → Movement (e.g., L/T-like inferred from bbox, but bbox alone doesn't consistently predict output position across varying grid sizes/heights).
- Any Green or Dark Red interactions (absent or non-adjacent in train 1; inconsistent positioning).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., no uniform color-to-hole links, no position-to-position mirroring across all). All identified are direct property links without forcing meaning.

[2025-10-01 22:41:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a falling blocks or gravity-based puzzle (similar to games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Puyo Puyo) where numbered blocks (representing colors or types) fall downward under gravity within a grid, but with rules that likely involve connected groups of the same number falling as units, potential matching/removal of adjacent same-number blocks, and rebuilding the grid after falls. The goal is to simulate one step of falling and settling, resulting in a new grid configuration.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks fall downward (toward higher row indices, assuming row 0 is top) but only until they hit another block or the bottom; independent per-cell falling doesn't work, as seen in mismatches where groups shift together.
 * Connected components of the same number likely fall as rigid units if adjacent (horizontally or vertically), preserving their shape during descent, rather than per-column independent movement—this explains why simple column gravity scrambles group positions in expected outputs.
 * No explicit empty cells (0s) are visible in inputs/outputs; all cells seem filled with numbers (1-9), so "empty" might be implicit or handled differently (e.g., gaps created by falling but not shown, or the grid is always dense).
 * Matching rules may apply: adjacent (3+ in a row/column) same numbers might disappear before or after falling, creating space for further drops, but this isn't simulated in the attempt—subtle because outputs show rearranged but not removed blocks.
 * Grid is represented as List[List[int]] with rows as outer lists; falling affects vertical positions but may involve horizontal stability for connected blobs.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s in train 1/2) seem fixed or "floor" layers that don't move, suggesting gravity only applies above certain stable bases.
 * Subtle: Rotations, merges, or color-specific behaviors (e.g., 5s as background?) might occur, but easy to miss without full rules; outputs show specific repositions like 8s/9s clustering differently.
 * All attempts must preserve grid dimensions and number distributions—no creation/destruction except possibly via matches.
 * Consider iterative falling: blocks may need multiple passes until stable, as single-pass column gravity leaves floating groups in generated vs. expected.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple per-column gravity, which worked for basic downward movement in isolated columns (e.g., stacking non-empties at bottom) but failed to handle connected groups across columns, leading to scrambled positions.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps many 5s static and drops 8s/9s/2s/1s/4s incorrectly per column (e.g., row 3 has 9 in col 18 generated vs. expected 8s cluster in cols 17-20; row 5 has 8s/9s/4/2 misplaced vs. expected 8s/9s/2s in specific blob shapes); unknown why blobs don't preserve shape, but likely because no component detection.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated drops 8s/9s/2s/4s/3s per column, creating floating or misaligned groups (e.g., row 11 has 8s/9s scattered vs. expected clustered 2s/9s in cols 17-20 and 8s below; row 18 has 9 in col 6 generated vs. expected 8s/7s cluster; bottom 3s intact but upper layers wrong); simple gravity ignores horizontal connections.
 * extract_columns and build_grid are helpful for column-wise ops but broken for this puzzle as they enable only independent falls, not group-aware simulation (still useful as building blocks).
 * apply_gravity is unhelpful/broken: Assumes empty=0 (but no 0s in grids), moves all non-empties to bottom per column without checking connections or stability, causing over-dropping and loss of structure (don't use in future without mods for groups).
 * No detection of matches/removals, missing potential disappearances that create fall space.
 * Core issue: Treats grid as independent columns instead of holistic structure with blobs; this partially understands vertical falling (some bottom stacking matches) but misses horizontal adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies simplistic per-column stacking (e.g., all 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s/2s/1s dropped to bottoms of their columns, creating dense lower layers with floating mismatches like isolated 9s/8s in upper rows), but ignores connected groups—e.g., clusters of 8s/9s in cols 4-6 and 20-23 should likely fall as units preserving shapes, not scatter vertically per column (generated has 8s split across rows 3-11 in col 4 vs. expected probable tight drop to row 5-7 or similar). This results in unnatural fragmentation (e.g., row 6 has scattered 3/8/7 vs. expected consolidated blobs) and doesn't account for potential matches (e.g., multiple adjacent 7s might clear). Without expected, it visually resembles over-simplified Tetris drops but fails training logic, so likely wrong; needs group detection to handle test's complex 7/8/9 clusters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformations on colored grids (likely representing images or patterns with numbers as colors), where rules govern pixel changes, shape movements, or mergers, often involving special values like 9 (possibly holes or temporary markers) interacting with backgrounds and other shapes. The goal is to apply consistent rules across examples to produce expected outputs, such as relocating or erasing elements while preserving borders and overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color, but transformations must preserve static borders (e.g., 1's, 4's) and not alter unrelated areas.
 * 9's appear to represent temporary or "hole" pixels that can be transferred, merged, or removed based on context: non-isolated 9's (adjacent to non-background) seem to blend into background or shapes, but isolated 9's may persist or move.
 * Shape movements or expansions: In training 1 expected, 8's expand or shift (e.g., row 2 has 8's where generated has 5's; row 3 has a 2 intrusion), suggesting rules for object propagation or filling holes rather than simple erasure.
 * Hole reduction: Comment in code mentions "hole reduction," but expected outputs show 9's relocating (e.g., training 1 row 3 has 9 in expected but not generated; training 2 has 9's in specific positions like row 11 col 19).
 * Subtle element: Connectivity matters—diagonal or full 8-directional adjacency might be needed for "isolation," as 4-directional (used in code) misses some interactions (e.g., training 2 generated keeps some 8's/9's isolated incorrectly).
 * Color-specific rules: 9's interact with specific shapes (e.g., 8's in training 1, 2's/8's in training 2), not just background; over-generalizing to all non-bg neighbors fails when shapes like 2 or 3 intrude.
 * Grid consistency: Outputs must match exact positions; small mismatches (e.g., a single 5 vs. 8) indicate rule gaps, like failing to handle multi-step transfers or conditional movements based on neighboring shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Preserve "divider" or border elements (e.g., 4's in training 2 rows 2-23); don't flood entire areas; account for vertical/horizontal asymmetries in shapes.
 * All attempts so far focus on 9-to-bg transfer, but ignore shape relocation (e.g., 8's moving right/down in expected vs. static in generated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, used in both trainings and test; essential for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def is_isolated(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Note: May need 8 directions for full connectivity
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            if g[nr][nc] != bg:
                return False
    return True
```
(This checks 4-directional isolation of 9's from non-background; helpful but limited—subtleties like diagonal connections may require expansion; used to avoid changing isolated 9's, which persists some correctly but misses mergers.)

```python
def transfer_pixels(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = get_background(g)
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if out[r][c] == 9 and not is_isolated(r, c, out, bg):
                out[r][c] = bg
    return out
```
(This applies the core transfer logic; partially helpful for non-isolated 9's but broken for cases needing movement instead of erasure, as seen in trainings.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on erasing non-isolated 9's to background, which worked partially for reducing some "small shapes" but failed to relocate or expand other elements (e.g., 8's static in generated vs. shifted in expected).
 * Training 1: Generated erased some 9's correctly (e.g., row 6 col 9 stays 9 as isolated?), but mismatched by keeping 5's where expected has 8's/2's (e.g., row 2 all 5's vs. expected 8's in row 2; row 3 has 9 at col 18 in generated but expected has 8's and 9 elsewhere; unknown why 8-shapes didn't propagate).
 * Training 1: Missed hole filling or shape intrusion (e.g., expected row 4 has 9 at col 18, but generated has it at col 18 unchanged? Wait, generated row 3 col 18 is 9, but expected row 3 has 8's/2; differences in 8-blob positions and a 4/9 mismatch in row 4).
 * Training 2: Generated erased some 9's (e.g., row 18 col 6 becomes 1? but expected has 8's moving), but kept invalid 8's/2's (e.g., row 5 has 8's where expected has all 1's; row 11 has 2's/9 where expected relocates them; row 17 has 8's in generated vs. expected 1's with 8's lower).
 * Training 2: Failed to collapse or move shapes upward/downward (e.g., expected simplifies upper rows to 1's, but generated retains scattered 8's/2's; unknown reason for not detecting multi-pixel "small shapes").
 * Overall: No training passed; attempt demonstrates partial understanding of 9's as transferable but ignores broader rules like shape adjacency mergers or position-specific changes; is_isolated is helpful but too narrow (4-dir vs. 8-dir?).
 * No object extraction attempted yet, but would be essential for identifying "small shapes" beyond single 9's (e.g., connected components of 8's/9's).
 * transfer_pixels is partially helpful for bg blending but not for the puzzle's apparent "movement" or "filling" mechanics; don't rely solely on it without shape detection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies the same 9-to-bg erasure as trainings, changing scattered 9's (e.g., row 19 col 8 to 7?, row 20 col 20 to 7?, row 25 col 4 to 7?, row 26 col 5 to 7?) but leaves shapes like 8's and 3's intact without apparent movement or expansion.
 * Unlike trainings, test has more 9's in lower rows (e.g., rows 25-29), but output erases non-isolated ones without addressing potential shape interactions (e.g., 8's in row 3 col 4-5 stay, but if rules involve propagation like in training 1 expected, they should shift).
 * Output mismatches likely expected by over-simplifying: e.g., row 6 has 1/4/8's unchanged, but puzzles may require filling holes with adjacent colors (7's?); background seems 7 (common), but 4's/1's/2's/3's persist without merger, suggesting incomplete rules.
 * No sense of "correctness" without expected, but based on training failures, this likely errs by not handling 8/9 clusters as movable objects (e.g., the 8-blob in rows 3-5 cols 4-8 may need to expand rightward like training 1's 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to simulate a block-dropping game on a grid where numbers represent colored blocks, with upward gravity (blocks move toward the top of the grid, i.e., lower row indices), removal of connected groups of three or more 9s, and a second application of gravity after removal to settle the grid. The goal is to process an input grid through these mechanics to produce a stable final state, preserving non-9 blocks and handling connectivity correctly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the grid, used to identify empty space for gravity drops.
 * Connected components are defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background number; single blocks are treated as components of size 1.
 * Gravity is upward (delta=-1, moving to lower row indices), and entire components drop as rigid units; the drop distance for a component is the minimum clear space above any of its blocks in the same column.
 * Components must be processed in a specific order during gravity: sort by descending max row (process "lower" components first), then descending min row, to avoid interference from higher-dropping components.
 * Removal targets only connected groups of 9s with size >=3; smaller 9 groups or singles stay, and removal sets them to background without triggering chain reactions beyond the second gravity pass.
 * After first gravity, remove 9 groups, then apply gravity again; no further removals or iterations.
 * Grid is rectangular; assume consistent row lengths, but handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Subtle: When clearing a component for drop calculation, the grid temporarily has holes, but drops are per-column and min across the component; if min_d=0, restore without moving.
 * Subtle: Gravity loop continues until no movement, but in practice, one pass per phase may suffice if stable.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order prevents components from blocking each other incorrectly; without it, drops can overlap or skip.
 * Easy to miss: 9 removal happens only once, post-first gravity, and only on connected 9s >=3; other numbers never remove.
 * Consideration: Outputs are flattened rows (lists of ints), but grids are 2D; preserve structure but print as 1D per row.
 * Consideration: In example 2, many 1s consolidate but some structures like 8s and 2s partially survive or reposition differently, suggesting complex interactions.

    return min_d
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies background via frequency and uses 4-way connected components, which is essential for grouping.
 * Gravity implementation moves components as units with min drop distance, which works for basic settling but fails in ordering: sorting by (-max_i, -min_i) processes "lower" first, but in training example 1, it leads to incorrect repositioning of 8s and 5s (e.g., generated has stacked 8s in row 2-3 that don't match expected scattered 8s and 2s integration).
 * In training example 1, post-removal gravity doesn't properly handle surviving 9s or 1s; generated ends with uniform 5s in many rows, but expected has varied placements like 8s in row 3 cols 17-20, a 2 in row 3 col 21, and specific 4/8/9 mixes in row 4—differences suggest over-dropping or incorrect clearing/restoration when min_d=0.
 * In training example 2, initial gravity consolidates 1s and 8s too aggressively upward, creating uniform 1 rows (e.g., generated rows 8-11 all 1s in many cols), but expected keeps more structure like isolated 2/9/8 groups lower (e.g., expected row 12 has 2s and 9, row 13 has 4/8/9/8)—this indicates the component processing order or drop calculation ignores inter-component collisions after clearing.
 * 9 removal works (groups >=3 cleared), but in example 2, generated removes some 8s/9s incorrectly or fails second gravity, leading to leftover 9s in row 6 and uniform bottoms, unlike expected where 8s form lines in rows 13-14/18-21 but 9s are isolated or removed selectively.
 * The apply_gravity loop with while True and moved flag is helpful for stability, but in practice, it over-applies in examples, homogenizing grids (e.g., all 2s at top in example 2 generated, but expected has 2s integrated lower).
 * remove_large_nines_groups is correct and relevant, as it targets only 9s >=3 connected.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are core, but compute_drop_distance may undercount if grid changes mid-drop (though it clears first, so potentially okay—issue likely in sequencing).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive stacking of 7s in nearly all middle rows (rows 3-30+ mostly 7s with some 2s/3s/9s sprinkled), and uniform 4s at the very top, which homogenizes the input's mixed 1/7/8/9/3/2/4 distribution unrealistically.
 * Input has diverse clusters (e.g., 7s scattered, 8s in groups, 3s at right bottom, 2s in cols 15-16), but output treats most non-4/3 as 7s dropping fully upward, ignoring distinct component identities—e.g., 8s and 9s should form separate groups post-gravity/removal, not merge into 7 stacks.
 * No 9 removal evident (input has potential 9 groups, like row 3 col7/ row4 col6, but output has stray 9s without clearing >=3), and second gravity seems to collapse everything without preserving shapes, unlike training expects where structures like 8-lines or 2-clusters survive in specific positions.
 * Bottom 3s are preserved but isolated; overall, output lacks the expected partial consolidation (e.g., 7s should cluster but not dominate all space, per training patterns), suggesting the program fails on larger/mixed grids by over-simplifying drops.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a gravity-based puzzle where the grid represents a 2D board (likely rows from top to bottom, with row 0 at the top), and non-background cells form connected "blobs" (4-directional connectivity of same or different numbers?) that fall downward independently after being cleared, stacking on top of existing structures or the bottom, simulating physics like in a match-3 or falling blocks game. The goal is to process blobs from bottom to top (highest row first) to apply gravity correctly without interference from lower blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common value in the grid, but in complex grids, ties or non-zero backgrounds might need handling (though not seen here).
 * Blobs are connected components of any non-background cells (not necessarily same number), using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal doesn't count, which is standard but easy to miss if 8-directional is assumed.
 * Blobs must be processed in order from lowest (highest row index, assuming row 0 is top) to highest to avoid upper blobs falling through cleared lower spaces incorrectly.
 * When computing drop distance for a blob, identify all columns it occupies, find the max row (lowest position) in that blob per column, then count consecutive background cells below it in the updated grid (after clearing previous blobs); take the MINIMUM drop across those columns to ensure the blob falls as a rigid unit without splitting.
 * After clearing a blob (set to background), drop it by the computed distance and place it in the new positions, but only if the new row < height; overhanging parts might be lost, but not seen in examples.
 * Subtlety: Dropping happens sequentially on a copy of the grid, so changes from lower blobs affect upper ones' drop calculations—processing bottom-up is crucial to simulate realistic gravity.
 * Blobs might overlap in columns after dropping, causing stacking; the min-drop ensures cohesion.
 * Grid is ragged in output (flattened rows), but input is 2D list; preserve width.
 * Easy to miss: Numbers within a blob can differ (e.g., 8,9 in same blob), so connectivity is by position, not value—blobs are groups of any non-background.
 * After all drops, unchanged top rows (all background) should remain as-is.
 * Potential edge: Empty grid or all background returns unchanged; single-cell blobs drop fully if possible.
 * In examples, some blobs seem to split or not connect properly, suggesting blob finding might over/under-connect based on value equality (but code doesn't require same value, which is good).

```
(This correctly identifies background as mode; useful and bug-free.)

                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y, num = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y, num))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != background:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny, g[nx][ny]))
                if blob:
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```
(This DFS-based blob finder is helpful for extracting connected non-background groups; stores position and value, which is key for later placement. It's correct in principle but may fail if blobs need same-value connectivity—examples suggest not.)

```python
def sort_blobs(blobs: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    def get_max_row(blob: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int:
        return max(i for i, _, _ in blob)
    return sorted(blobs, key=get_max_row, reverse=True)
```
(This sorts by lowest point of blob, processing bottom-up; essential for sequential gravity.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background and finds blobs via DFS, which works for connectivity, but fails to apply gravity properly in both training examples—blobs are cleared and dropped, but resulting positions don't match expected falling patterns (e.g., in Train 1, upper 8/9 blobs don't drop into cleared spaces correctly, leaving gaps or misplaced cells).
 * In Train 1, generated output keeps most top rows unchanged but mangles lower blobs (e.g., row 7 has a single 4 misplaced, row 8 has scattered 8/1/5 instead of consolidated drop); expected shows specific 8/9 groups dropping and reshaping, suggesting drop calculation ignores updated grid state or min-distance is wrong (unknown why, but drop_d seems too small or columns misidentified).
 * In Train 2, generated has excessive unchanged rows and blobs like 8/9 not dropping fully (e.g., row 16 has partial 8's, row 17 has fragmented 8/7/1); expected consolidates 8/9/2 into lower positions with proper stacking, indicating the sequential clearing/placing doesn't propagate space correctly—upper blobs fall as if lower ones weren't cleared.
 * compute_drop_distance finds min drop over blob columns based on max_i per col, which is good for rigid drop, but in practice overestimates obstacles (uses new_g after prior clears, but examples show it doesn't "see" the cleared space below).
 * place_blob only places if new_i < height, which is safe, but may clip blobs (not an issue here); however, it doesn't handle if drop causes overlap with uncleared lower blobs.
 * apply_gravity processes sorted_blobs but applies to a copy (new_g), which is correct, yet outputs show blobs not stacking—perhaps sorting reverse=True (bottom-first) is right, but drop calc assumes static below, missing chain reactions.
 * Overall, blob finding seems functional (captures groups like 8/9), but gravity simulation is broken: drops are minimal or zero for many, leading to near-identical grids; unhelpful if connectivity required same values (but code doesn't, and examples have mixed).
 * No unhelpful functions standout, but the full program integrates them poorly—e.g., no validation that blobs don't overlap post-drop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows many repetitive rows of [1,1,7,7,... ,2,2,7,7,... ,3,3] from row 2 onward, with scattered changes in lower rows (e.g., row 3 has 8/9 inserted oddly, row 6 has 3/4 misplaced, row 29 has 9/8/1 at end), but top rows are all 4's unchanged, suggesting minimal dropping happened.
 * Expected should simulate full gravity: identify blobs (e.g., 7's, 8/9 groups, 2's, 3's), clear bottom ones first (like lower 8/9/2), drop them to bottom (possibly stacking on 3's or filling to row ~29), then upper blobs (like top 7's) drop into those spaces; generated has no such consolidation—7's barely move, 8/9 fragments stay high, 2's static, indicating drop_distance computes 0 or 1 for most, ignoring cleared paths.
 * Differences: Generated keeps structure almost intact (e.g., row 12 has 2's in place, but expected would shift everything down); lower rows have artifacts like isolated 9/8 in row 29, unlike expected rigid blob falls; overall, it looks like partial/incomplete simulation, not matching physics where blobs should cascade down fully.
 * To handle test, need to ensure drop calc scans the entire column below max_i for background runs in the progressively updated grid; current min(ds) per blob is right in theory but fails in practice (perhaps bug in cols=set(j for _,j,_ in blob) missing multi-col spans, or while loop in compute_drop_distance stops prematurely).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal appears to be cleaning up or reconstructing a scene by identifying a dominant color (likely the background or main element), filling small non-dominant components within its bounding box, and repositioning specific elements like maroon (color 8) toward a central area, while preserving key structures like borders, objects, and anomalies (e.g., 9s as special markers). The process aims to match expected "clean" or "corrected" grids that maintain object shapes, positions, and details without over-filling or mis-shifting elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Dominant color (e.g., 5 in Train 1, 1 or 4 in Train 2, 7 in test) must be accurately identified as the most common non-background color, but not over-applied to erase important small features like isolated 9s, thin borders (e.g., color 4 lines), or object details.
 * Bounding box should tightly enclose the dominant color's main area to avoid processing irrelevant parts of the grid, but must handle irregular shapes without excluding connected components.
 * Small components (< threshold, e.g., 10 cells) of non-dominant colors inside the bbox should be filled with dominant color only if they are noise/holes; do not fill structural elements like borders (4), object protrusions (e.g., 8 clusters), or anomalies (9s, which seem to represent eyes or special points that must remain).
 * Maroon (8) elements represent objects (e.g., perhaps a character or shape) that need repositioning toward the grid's center, but the shift must be precise (not a fixed 5-column right shift, as it overwrites and misplaces them); consider vertical/horizontal centering based on bbox or grid midpoint, and avoid clearing originals to background (0) if they overlap other elements.
 * Preserve borders and frames (e.g., 1s on sides, 4s as dividers) without alteration, as they define the puzzle structure; top/bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s) are often uniform backgrounds that should not be touched.
 * Anomalies like 9s are rare and must stay in place as they likely indicate key features (e.g., eyes in a face); 0s are empty/neutral spaces to fill selectively, but not all (e.g., larger gaps might be intentional).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 13x26 in Train 1, 26x26 in Train 2, 30x28 in test), so functions must handle rectangular inputs dynamically; connected components should use 4-directional adjacency, but only within bbox to avoid global flooding.
 * Subtle elements: In Train 1, expected output repositions 8s into a more central blob with 9s intact, without filling internal 0s prematurely; in Train 2, small 8/9 clusters and 2s must form specific patterns (e.g., a face or symbol) without being erased. Over-shifting 8s can collide with other colors, creating mismatches.
 * Threshold for "small" components needs tuning (10 may be too low, missing medium noise); do not fill if component touches bbox edges, as it might be a border extension.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes object recognition (e.g., extracting blobs of 8s as movable entities) over blind filling, with rules favoring preservation of visual motifs like symmetry or alignment.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_dominant_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most frequent color, useful for background/main element; works in all examples as 5, 1/4-ish, 7.)

```python
def get_bounding_box(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    cols = len(g[0])
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = rows, -1, cols, -1
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == color:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)
                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This computes a tight bbox for the dominant color, essential for local processing; accurate but needs to handle empty bbox gracefully.)

```python
def fill_small_components(g: List[List[int]], dominant: int, bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], threshold: int = 10) -> List[List[int]]:
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
    if max_r < min_r:
        return out
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = set()
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if (r, c) not in visited and g[r][c] != dominant:
                component = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited.add((r, c))
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
                        if (min_r <= nr <= max_r and min_c <= nc <= max_c and
                            0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited and g[nr][nc] != dominant):
                            visited.add((nr, nc))
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if len(component) < threshold:
                    for pr, pc in component:
                        out[pr][pc] = dominant
    return out
```
(This performs DFS-based connected component filling within bbox, helpful for noise removal; works partially but over-fills non-noise like 9s or small 8 parts; threshold=10 is a starting point but needs exceptions for special colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies dominant color and bbox in all cases, and fills some small 0/9 holes appropriately (e.g., scattered 0s in Train 1 rows 4-7 become 5s in generated, matching expected in parts).
 * Fill_small_components works for tiny noise (e.g., isolated 0s in Train 2) but fails on medium components or specials: in Train 1, it incorrectly fills some 8-adjacent 0s and leaves 9s unfilled when they should stay; in Train 2, it erases small 2/9 clusters (e.g., row 11 generated has no 2s where expected has them) and over-fills 8s prematurely.
 * move_maroon_toward_center is broken/unhelpful: fixed 5-column right shift misplaces 8s entirely (e.g., Train 1 generated shifts 8s in rows 4-10 rightward into 5s/0s, creating smears not in expected; Train 2 scatters 8s into borders, losing shape); it clears originals to 0, which introduces new holes, and ignores vertical centering or collision detection.
 * Overall, attempt understands component-based cleaning but misses subtlety of preserving object integrity (8s as movable blobs, 9s as fixed points) and precise repositioning; Train 1 generated mismatches expected in 8/9 placements (e.g., expected row 2 has 8s at cols 17-20, generated has them elsewhere; unknown why 8s aren't clustered centrally) and row 8 has extra 1s/0s; Train 2 mismatches in lower half (e.g., expected rows 17-23 have specific 8/9 patterns for a shape, generated fills them with 1s/0s).
 * No object extraction function present, but one would be essential to identify and relocate 8-blobs as units (e.g., find connected 8 components, compute their centroid, shift to grid center).
 * Program copies grid correctly and uses neutral 0, but doesn't handle multi-dominant areas (e.g., Train 2 has competing 1/4) or edge cases like 8s outside bbox.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it over-fills with dominant 7 across most of the grid (e.g., rows 7-30 are nearly uniform 7s with side 1/2/3 borders), erasing likely object details like clustered 8s/9s/4s (e.g., row 5 has 8s scattered and partially filled, but expected probably preserves a central 8-shape with 9-eyes intact, similar to Train 1/2 patterns).
 * Small components like 0/9 in rows 3-6 (e.g., 9 at row 5 col 5) are filled or ignored incorrectly, creating solid 7 blocks where holes/eyes should remain; 8s in rows 3-12 are shifted/misplaced (e.g., row 9 has 8s at end, but likely should be centered without overwriting 7s).
 * Borders (1s left, 3s right, 4s top) are preserved somewhat, but internal structures (e.g., row 6's 3/4 anomalies) are lost to 7-filling, mismatched from trainings where such details stay; the uniform lower rows suggest over-aggressive filling without bbox limiting or object protection.
 * No clear central repositioning of 8s (they're smeared right/down), and extra 0s persist in places (e.g., row 9 cols 20-22), indicating the shift function failed similarly to trainings; overall, it looks like a "washed out" version missing the visual puzzle's key elements (e.g., a face or symbol formed by 8/9).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, likely representing a "canvas" or image that needs to be vertically flipped or reversed between uniform border rows (top and bottom), while preserving those borders, to match evolving patterns across multiple frames or examples. The goal is to process a sequence of grids (as a list of rows) and output the transformed version that aligns with expected visual changes, such as correcting orientations or symmetries in drawn objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify uniform rows (all elements identical) at the top and bottom as fixed borders that should not be altered or included in any reversal.
 * The "canvas" is the non-uniform middle section between borders; it must be reversed vertically (i.e., flip the order of rows in this section) to correct the orientation, but only if it matches the puzzle's visual logic—subtly, not all middle rows may need full reversal if they contain partial patterns or evolving elements.
 * Patterns in the middle often represent "objects" or shapes (e.g., sequences of 8s forming a blob or line, 9s as highlights, or mixed numbers like 1,2 for structures) that evolve across rows; reversal should preserve their internal structure but flip their vertical position to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Uniformity check must be strict (empty rows are uniform, but grids are non-empty); borders may vary in thickness (multiple consecutive uniform rows); reversal applies only to the canvas, but if borders are misidentified (e.g., a nearly uniform row with one outlier is not uniform), the canvas slice is wrong, leading to partial reversals or unchanged rows.
 * Across examples, top borders are often solid (e.g., all 1s or 5s), bottom are solid (e.g., all 2s or 3s), and canvas has asymmetric patterns that need flipping to symmetrize or correct (e.g., in training 1, row 3 expected has 8s ending with 2, suggesting a shape adjustment post-reversal).
 * Easy to miss: Reversal is row-order flip, not element-level; some rows in canvas may appear uniform after reversal but weren't before; evolving frames mean the program must handle varying border sizes and non-symmetric objects; test grids have wider dimensions (28 columns vs 26 in training), so code must be dimension-agnostic.
 * Considerations from attempts: Over-reversing includes border rows if uniformity is mischecked; under-reversing leaves canvas intact when it should flip; objects like 8-clusters or 9-dots may need extraction to verify post-reversal shapes, but simple reversal alone fails if borders shift per row.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)
```
(This function correctly identifies uniform rows for border detection; it's reliable and should be reused.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```
(This is the core program from the attempt; it correctly slices and reverses the canvas but fails on border precision and full pattern matching—helpful as a base but needs refinement for object-aware reversal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and skips multi-row uniform borders (e.g., in training 1, it skips top all-1s/5s and bottom all-2s correctly in many rows), preserving them unchanged, which matches expected outputs where borders stay static.
 * Reversal of the canvas works partially for simple cases (e.g., in training 1 rows 1-2 and 10-13, generated matches expected all-5s/1s with 4,4 inserts), but fails when canvas contains asymmetric objects: e.g., training 1 row 3 generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,9,9,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,2,2]—generated has 8,9,9,8 (wrong shape, extra 9s, no 2 inserts) instead of solid 8s with 2s, suggesting reversal didn't align the blob correctly or mis-sliced canvas.
 * In training 1 row 4, generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2]—minor mismatch in canvas reversal (e.g., 4 placement wrong, 9 not flipped properly), indicating border detection skipped too few rows or reversal order is off for evolving patterns.
 * Training 1 row 5 generated has scattered 2s and 8s not matching expected clustered 8s with 2s; row 6 has 1s and 8s misplaced vs expected 1,8,8,9 cluster—unknown why reversal creates these outliers, possibly because canvas includes semi-uniform rows.
 * Training 2 shows similar issues: borders (top all-2s, bottom all-3s, side 4,4 and 7,7) preserved well, but canvas reversal fails badly—e.g., row 11 generated [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7] vs expected [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1,7,7], where generated inserts wrong 4s instead of flipping to include 2,9 pattern; row 14 generated has scattered 8s/9s/3 not matching expected 8-clusters.
 * Overall, attempt understands border uniformity (worked for static parts) but not canvas object evolution (didn't work: reversal misaligns shapes like 8-blobs or 9-dots, leading to extra/missing numbers); no object extraction attempted, which might help verify shapes post-reversal.
 * Function `is_uniform` is helpful and correct; the slicing logic in `program` is mostly sound but broken for variable canvas content (e.g., doesn't handle intra-row patterns or why some rows stay unchanged when they should flip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate puzzle understanding, as it mostly preserves or partially reverses the canvas but mangles object patterns similarly to training failures—e.g., rows 6-7 have scattered 9s in 7-clusters ([1,1,7,7,7,9,7,...] vs likely expected solid 7s with flipped 9-position for symmetry), and row 20 has [...,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,3,3] which introduces misplaced 2s not aligning with any clear flipped shape (expected might cluster 2s/8s/9s vertically from input patterns like row 12's 9s).
 * Lower rows (e.g., 24-28) show chaotic mixes like [1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,...] and [1,1,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,...] vs input's more structured 7s/2s/3s—reversal seems to flip but not correct orientations (e.g., 8,9 clusters appear fragmented, missing expected merges or border integrations like training's 2-inserts); overall, it looks like incomplete flipping without object awareness, so borders (top all-4s, bottom all-3s?) are handled but canvas shapes (7-blobs, 2/8/9 elements) are distorted, not making visual sense as a corrected image.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to preprocess and transform the grid by identifying a background color, detecting vertical dividing bars to split the grid into panels, and applying specific rules to merge small isolated shapes, shift maroon (color 8) shapes upward within panels, and reposition light blue (color 9) shapes relative to red/yellow (colors 2/4) in the same row. The transformations aim to normalize or consolidate elements for further puzzle solving, such as object extraction or pattern matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the flattened grid; assume it's 0 or similar neutral, but confirm via Counter.
 * Dividing bars are full-height vertical columns (or sequences of columns) of uniform non-background color; they must span the entire height (h rows) with no variation in that column.
 * Panels are rectangular regions between bars (from left=0 to w-1 if no bars); each panel is defined by (left_col, right_col, top=0, bottom=h-1), assuming no horizontal divisions.
 * Small shapes to merge: Isolated pixels or tiny groups (colors 2,4,9) with <=1 neighbor (in 4 directions, within panel bounds); count self + neighbors <=2 total pixels per group, but code checks per cell.
 * Merging: Up to 3 small pixels per panel are cleared to background, then "placed" (overwritten) in the bottom row starting from left of panel; this seems like consolidating small debris to the panel's bottom-left corner.
 * Maroon (8) transformation: Shift entire vertical stacks or blobs upward by up to 5 rows (min(shift, distance to panel top)) without overlapping existing cells; track moved positions to avoid double-shifts.
 * Light blue (9) repositioning: Move to immediately right of a red/yellow (2 or 4) in the same row within the panel if possible; if no such position, try right of first global red/yellow or leave in place; avoid overwriting.
 * Process order matters: Merge small shapes first, then shift maroon, then reposition light blue; apply transformations per panel to avoid cross-panel interference.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns unchanged; single panel if no bars; small panels may have no space for placements; neighbors only count same color and within panel; shifts avoid going above panel top.
 * Subtle: "Small shapes" may include diagonals or not (code uses 4-dir orthogonal); merging only up to 3 per panel, even if more exist; light blue move only if exact row match for target, else fallback.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal bars/divisions not handled (assumes vertical only); color 9 might be part of larger shapes, but code treats individually; background != small colors; errors if no red/yellow for repositioning.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using frequency count; useful as a starting point.)

```python
def identify_dividing_bars(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < w:
        col = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != background:
            start = c
            color = col[0]
            c += 1
            while c < w:
                col_next = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
                if len(set(col_next)) == 1 and col_next[0] == color:
                    c += 1
                else:
                    break
            end = c - 1
            bars.append((start, end, color))
        else:
            c += 1
    return bars
```
(This detects contiguous full-height vertical bars of uniform non-background color; helpful for splitting grid, but assumes no gaps in bar color.)

```python
def identify_panels(bars: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    if not bars:
        return [(0, w - 1, 0, h - 1)] if w > 0 and h > 0 else []
    panels = []
    left = 0
    for start, end, _ in bars:
        if left < start:
            panels.append((left, start - 1, 0, h - 1))
        left = end + 1
    if left < w:
        panels.append((left, w - 1, 0, h - 1))
    return panels
```
(This derives panels as regions between/around bars; core for localizing transformations, but fixed to full height.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented background detection, bar/panel identification, and the three main transformations (merge small, shift maroon, reposition light blue), showing partial understanding of core rules like panel isolation and color-specific moves.
 * What worked: Background finding via Counter is robust and likely correct; bar detection handles contiguous columns well; panel derivation correctly splits regions; small shape neighbor check (4-dir, within panel) captures isolation; maroon shift logic avoids overlap and respects panel bounds.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all examples—blank error on Train 1 (possibly index out-of-bounds or empty grid handling); tuple concatenation error on Train 2 and Test (traced to reposition_light_blue: unpacking `next(...)` (tuple) with `red_yellow_pos[0]` (tuple) but fallback `red_yellow_pos[0]` when next fails, causing (tuple, tuple) but error mentions "int", likely when red_yellow_pos empty or mismatched types like pc+1 as int in condition).
 * Merge_small_shapes partially works but may over-merge (collects all small pixels then takes [:3], but doesn't group true connected components—treats isolated cells only); placement overwrites bottom-left without checking if it's background or free.
 * Transform_maroon_shapes shifts per cell, not per connected blob, potentially fragmenting shapes; min(5, r - p_top) is good but doesn't handle horizontal extent of maroon.
 * Reposition_light_blue collects global red/yellow but tries per-panel; next() fallback to red_yellow_pos[0] causes type error if no matches (unpacking tuple with potentially int-mixed); doesn't handle multiple 9s or overwriting.
 * No object extraction function attempted (e.g., to identify full shapes post-transform); program assumes fixed colors (2=red,4=yellow,8=maroon,9=light blue) without verification.
 * Overall, syntax/logic bugs prevent any output; Train 1 error unknown but possibly empty panels or h/w=0; no observed generated grids to compare, so can't verify if transformations match expected (e.g., small shapes consolidated correctly).
 * Function merge_small_shapes is buggy (small_pixels collected but merged without connectivity, placement may overlap bars); transform_maroon_shapes is helpful but incomplete for blobs; reposition_light_blue is broken (type error, unclear fallback); identify_dividing_bars is solid but misses non-full-height bars if puzzle has partial ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple"), so no grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected transformed grid.
 * Without output, can't verify if it correctly merges small 2/4/9 pixels to bottom-left, shifts 8s up by <=5 rows per panel, or moves 9s right of 2/4 in-row; likely fails early in reposition_light_blue due to empty red_yellow_pos or next() unpacking.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Assuming test grid has background 0, vertical bars (e.g., color 1 or 5 full columns), panels with scattered small 2/4/9 (isolated, <=1 neighbor each), vertical 8 stacks, and 9s near but not adjacent to 2/4—output should have panels with smalls cleared and stacked at bottom-left (up to 3 colors preserved), 8s lifted up within panel tops, 9s shifted right to touch 2/4 in row; differs from error by actually producing a valid grid.
 * Error indicates unhandled case (no red/yellow for 9 repositioning), so test likely has panels without 2/4, causing fallback failure—must fix to leave 9s in place if no targets.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity where non-background blocks connected in 4-way adjacent groups of the same color form rigid "components" that fall downward as intact units, processed from the bottom of the grid upward to avoid interference, until they stack on other blocks or the bottom, with the background color being the most common value in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection must use the most frequent color across the entire flat grid, but handle empty grids gracefully (default to 0).
 * Connected components include single blocks and are strictly same-color and 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding background.
 * Components must be processed in bottom-to-top order by sorting on the maximum row index (highest row number first, assuming row 0 is top), to simulate gravity without later drops affecting earlier ones.
 * For dropping: Each component is cleared from the grid first, then the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background spaces below the lowest point of the component in each of its occupied columns (starting from just below that lowest row in the column).
 * Dropped positions must not exceed grid bounds; if the new row would be out of bounds, the block stays or clips, but in practice, it seems to cap at grid height.
 * Subtlety: Drop calculation is per-column lowest point, but the whole component shifts rigidly by the min drop across its columns, preserving relative positions (e.g., multi-column shapes don't rotate or separate).
 * Components can span multiple columns, and drop is limited by the "tightest" column (least space below), which can cause uneven stacking if columns have different obstacles.
 * After dropping one component, the grid updates, so subsequent components see the new state (e.g., they might land on previously dropped ones).
 * No merging or re-connection after drops; components remain as they were.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length), rows are lists of ints (colors 0-9 likely), and output must be a new grid with exact same dimensions.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order is critical—top-down would cause overlaps or incorrect stacking; also, "lowest" is max row index per column for the component.
 * Empty spaces are only background; non-background blocks block drops.
 * Singles and small groups must be treated identically to large ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent number in the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This works well for background detection, as seen in outputs where 5 seems to be background in example 1, but verify per grid.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find connected components of same non-background numbers (4-way adjacent), including singles."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != background:
                num = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == num:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, num))
    return components
```
(This correctly identifies components with positions as (row, col) tuples and color, using DFS/stack for connectivity; essential for rigid unit extraction.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (e.g., 5 in example 1, 2 in example 2) and finds connected components accurately, including singles and multi-block shapes.
 * Sorting components bottom-to-top by max row works in principle to process gravity order.
 * Clearing component before drop and attempting rigid shift by min column drop distance captures the core rigid-body fall idea.
 * Train 1 generated output keeps top rows unchanged (all 5s and some 1s/4s/2s static, which is correct for non-falling parts), but fails to properly drop lower components: e.g., 8s and 9s in rows 7-11 are misplaced or not dropped far enough (generated has 8s scattered in row 9-11 without forming expected clusters like [8,8,8,8] in row 2 of expected), and a 1 in row 7 col 18 is wrong (expected has 8 there); also, row 4 expected has 8s/9s/4s/2s in specific positions, but generated has incorrect 5s/8s/9s scattering—likely due to flawed per-column lowest calc or not updating grid properly for subsequent drops.
 * Train 2 generated output correctly keeps top 2s and bottom 3s static, and stacks some 4s/1s/7s in upper rows, but messes up lower drops: e.g., row 11 expected has 2s/9/2s but generated has all 1s/7s; row 17 expected has 1s but generated has 8s misplaced; row 20 expected has 4/8/9/1s but generated has scattered 8s/9s/4s/2s/3s in wrong spots—drop distance underestimates space in some columns, causing partial overlaps or insufficient fall; also, 3 in row 23 expected but generated has 9/1s there.
 * Overall, drop logic fails: col_lowest uses max i per column (correct for lowest point), but count of backgrounds below starts from lowest+1 and stops at first non-background (correct), yet min(d) across columns leads to too-small drops, as seen in both trains where components don't reach expected stacked positions (e.g., 8-group in train 1 should drop more to row 2-4 area).
 * No rotation or color change, which is correct, but grid copy (new_g) is good to avoid mutating original.
 * Function get_background and find_connected_components are helpful and accurate; main program drop calc is broken (under-drops, possibly miscounts empties after prior clears).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the inf drop init and stack-based DFS are solid—avoid recursive DFS to prevent stack overflow in large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with two full rows of 4s (possibly assuming 4 as background, but input likely has different bg—wait, input not shown, but output has 4s filling top, which shouldn't happen as static parts should remain), then repeats [1,1,7s,2s,7s,3s] blocks identically across rows 2-20 without variation, indicating no drops occurred for most components (rigid 7/2/3 strips didn't fall), and bottom rows 21-30 have chaotic scattering of 1/7/8/9/2/4/3 (e.g., row 29 has mixed 1/4/3/9/9/7/9/9/8/8/7/1/7/2/2/7/7/7/7/9/7/7/2/2/4/3/3, far from any stacked order)—this suggests components weren't cleared/dropped properly, min-drop was 0 for many (no fall), or sorting failed, leading to static copy with minor bottom jumble; expected should have upper static rows, then fallen 7/8/9 groups stacking rigidly from bottom (e.g., 8s/9s dropping into lower rows without overlap, preserving shapes like vertical 7 strips but shifted down by column-min empties).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all examples (train input 1, train output 1, train input 2, train output 2, test input 1, test input 2), I identified only interactions and connections that are obvious, directly observable in the bounding boxes, pixel counts, hole counts, colors, and positions, and appear **in every single one** without exception. I ignored any high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., standalone strip colors without interaction, unique one-off shapes like isolated Greens or Dark Reds that don't connect consistently), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., hole reductions only in train outputs, not inputs; color shifts that vary). No attempts to explain or hypothesize transformations—only direct, consistent links between properties/components. If a potential connection (e.g., specific position-to-color mapping) wasn't uniform across all six lists, it was excluded as unknown or inconsistent. Elements without clear, repeated interaction (e.g., Blue small shapes appear in some but not all; Orange canvas only in train 1) were omitted.

#### 1. **Canvas Area (Large Blob) ↔ Shapes (Pixel Count Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The large canvas blob (e.g., Orange in train 1, Blue in train 2, Dark Red in tests; always a single dominant area per side/panel with bbox spanning most of the inner grid, holes ≥0, pixels >> small shapes) has its pixel count directly and inversely connected to the total pixel count of all shapes placed within its bbox. Specifically: `canvas_pixels + sum_of_shape_pixels_within_bbox ≈ full_bbox_area` (calculated as (maxx - minx + 1) × (maxy - miny + 1)), with near-exact matches accounting for minor boundary overlaps.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train input 1 left (Orange [2,0,11,12], 10×13=130 area, 114 pixels) + shapes within (16 pixels) = 130.
     - Train input 1 right (Orange [14,0,23,12], 130 area, 115 pixels) + shapes within (≈15 pixels) = ≈130.
     - Train output 1 left (Orange [2,0,11,12], 130 area, 116 pixels) + shapes within (≈14 pixels) = ≈130.
     - Train output 1 right (Orange [14,0,23,12], 130 area, 116 pixels) + shapes within (≈14 pixels) = ≈130.
     - Train input 2 (Blue [2,2,23,23], 22×22=484 area, 442 pixels) + shapes within (42 pixels) = 484.
     - Train output 2 (Blue [2,2,23,23], 484 area, 445 pixels) + shapes within (39 pixels) = 484.
     - Test input 1 left (Dark Red [2,2,13,29], 12×28=336 area, 306 pixels) + shapes within (30 pixels) = 336.
     - Test input 1 right (Dark Red [16,2,25,29], 10×28=280 area, 250 pixels) + shapes within (30 pixels) = 280.
     - Test input 2 (No single large canvas blob listed, but aggregated Dark Red pieces [2,12,15,13] + [10,19,12,19] + [7,24,7,24] span inner area; however, partial overlap with shapes confirms inverse pixel relation in sub-areas, e.g., near-bottom Dark Red pixels reduced by adjacent Maroon/Light Blue placements).
   - **Properties Involved**: Canvas pixels, shape pixels, bbox dimensions (position/size of canvas constrains shape placement).
   - **Note**: This is purely additive/subtractive; no color or hole interaction here, as those vary.

#### 2. **Canvas Area (Holes) ↔ Shapes (Position and Clustering Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The hole count of the canvas blob is affected by the positions and clustering of shapes within its bbox—specifically, when 2+ small shapes (Light Blue or Yellow, 1-4 pixels) are positioned adjacent (overlapping or sharing bbox edges, e.g., Δx/Δy ≤1) to a Maroon cluster (≥5 pixels), it consistently correlates with canvas holes ≥1. Isolated shapes (no adjacency) do not trigger this; holes represent enclosed voids in canvas connectivity caused by clustered shape placements.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train input 1 left (holes=2): Maroon [4,4,7,7] adjacent to Light Blue [6,5,6,5] (overlaps y5, Δx=2) and [9,5,9,6] (shares y5-6 edge).
     - Train input 1 right (holes=2): Maroon [17,8,21,10] adjacent to Light Blue [18,10,19,10] (overlaps x18-19, y10).
     - Train output 1 left (holes=1): Maroon [7,3,9,7] adjacent to Light Blue [9,5,9,6] (shares x9, y5-6).
     - Train output 1 right (holes=1): Maroon [17,2,20,5] adjacent to Light Blue [18,3,18,3] (Δx=1-2, y3).
     - Train input 2 (holes=4): Maroon [15,3,19,5] adjacent to Light Blue [17,5,17,6] (overlaps x17, y5); second Maroon [9,11,13,14] adjacent to Light Blue [11,13,11,13] (overlaps x11, y13); additional clusters with Yellow [14,4,14,5] (overlaps x14? adjacent to first Maroon) and [10,15,12,15] (near second).
     - Train output 2 (holes=2): Maroon [17,12,21,14] adjacent to Light Blue [19,11,19,12] (Δx=2, shares y12); second Maroon [5,17,8,21] adjacent to Light Blue [6,19,6,19] (overlaps x6, y19).
     - Test input 1 left (holes=4): Maroon [6,3,7,5] adjacent to Light Blue [5,4,5,4] (Δx=1, y4); Maroon [3,3,4,5] adjacent to Yellow [2,5,2,5] (Δx=1, y5); Maroon [9,8,11,10] adjacent to Light Blue [9,9,9,9] (overlaps x9, y9) and [10,8,10,8] (adjacent x10, y8).
     - Test input 1 right (holes=1): Maroon [18,6,24,11] adjacent to Light Blue [21,6,22,7] (overlaps x21-22, y6-7).
     - Test input 2 (holes=1 in Maroon [8,23,13,25], acting as partial canvas): Adjacent to Light Blue [10,24,10,24] (overlaps x10, y24) and [5,24,5,25] (Δx=3-5 but clustered with Maroon [5,5,5,7] higher up via chain).
   - **Properties Involved**: Canvas holes, shape positions (bbox coords), shape clustering (adjacency via Δx/Δy or overlap), limited to Maroon + (Light Blue or Yellow).
   - **Note**: Red small shapes (1-2 pixels) sometimes adjacent but do not consistently trigger holes (e.g., isolated in train 1); excluded as inconsistent. Hole values vary (1-4), but the adjacency trigger is uniform.

#### 3. **Maroon Clusters ↔ Small Light Blue/Yellow (Position Adjacency Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Maroon clusters (always 5-18 pixels, irregular bbox spanning 2-6 units) consistently have 1-2 small Light Blue or Yellow shapes (1-4 pixels, single-column bbox) positioned adjacent to or overlapping their bbox edges, affecting the overall shape silhouette (e.g., extending the effective bbox by 1-2 units in x or y). This adjacency is preserved in configuration (not exact position) across panels.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train input 1 left: Maroon [4,4,7,7] adjacent/overlaps Light Blue [6,5] (internal) and [9,5,9,6] (right edge x7→9).
     - Train input 1 right: Maroon [17,8,21,10] overlaps Light Blue [18,10,19,10] (bottom edge).
     - Train output 1 left: Maroon [7,3,9,7] adjacent to Light Blue [9,5,9,6] (right edge x9).
     - Train output 1 right: Maroon [17,2,20,5] adjacent to Light Blue [18,3] (internal-ish).
     - Train input 2: Maroon [15,3,19,5] adjacent to Yellow [14,4,14,5] (left edge x15→14) and Light Blue [17,5,17,6] (bottom); Maroon [9,11,13,14] adjacent to Light Blue [11,13] (internal).
     - Train output 2: Maroon [17,12,21,14] adjacent to Yellow [16,12,16,13] (left) and Light Blue [19,11,19,12] (bottom); Maroon [5,17,8,21] adjacent to Yellow [4,18,4,20] (left).
     - Test input 1 left: Maroon [6,3,7,5] adjacent to Light Blue [5,4] (left/top); Maroon [3,3,4,5] adjacent to Yellow [2,5] (left); Maroon [9,8,11,10] adjacent to Yellow [10,7] (top, Δy=1) and Light Blue [10,8] + [9,9] (internal).
     - Test input 1 right: Maroon [18,6,24,11] adjacent to Light Blue [21,6,22,7] (internal).
     - Test input 2: Maroon [5,5,5,7] adjacent to Light Blue [5,4] (top); Maroon [6,6,8,9] adjacent to Light Blue [6,6,7,7] (overlaps); Maroon [10,16,12,18] adjacent to Light Blue [11,16,11,17] (internal); Maroon [8,23,13,25] adjacent to Light Blue [10,24] (internal).
   - **Properties Involved**: Maroon bbox (edges), small shape bbox (position relative to edges), pixels (small shapes always ≤4, Maroon ≥5).
   - **Note**: This does not include Red small shapes (inconsistent adjacency, e.g., isolated Reds in train 1 left). No direct color change or transformation explained—positions shift, but adjacency persists.

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Connections
- Position → Color (e.g., y=5 often Light Blue in train 1, but varies to Red/Yellow in train 2/tests; not uniform).
- Hole Count → Specific Shape Transform (e.g., holes=2 in train 1 vs. 4 in train 2 lead to different pixel shifts; cannot explain consistently).
- Specific Shape Silhouette → Movement (e.g., L/T-like inferred from bbox, but bbox alone doesn't consistently predict output position across varying grid sizes/heights).
- Any Green or Dark Red interactions (absent or non-adjacent in train 1; inconsistent positioning).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., no uniform color-to-hole links, no position-to-position mirroring across all). All identified are direct property links without forcing meaning.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.

[2025-10-01 23:05:14] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]

def identify_dividing_bars(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < w:
        col = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != background:
            start = c
            color = col[0]

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:06:15] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid representing comic book panels divided by vertical bars, where the goal is to process and rearrange elements like small shapes (e.g., red=2, yellow=4, orange=9), maroon blobs (8), and other colors against a background, following rules for consolidation, shifting, and repositioning to match a stylized or corrected layout. The program attempts to automate this by identifying panels, merging small components, shifting maroons upward, and moving 9's adjacent to certain colors, but it fails to produce exact matches due to incorrect handling of component detection, placement logic, and panel-specific rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are defined by vertical dividing bars (full-height columns of uniform non-background color), but the code assumes all bars span the entire height and width correctly; subtle issue: bars might not always be full-height or could be interrupted, leading to misidentified panels (e.g., in train 1, panels seem split around columns 12-13 for 4's).
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common color (e.g., 5 in train 1, 1 or 7 in others), but ensure it's not confused with sparse elements; all operations clear to background.
 * Small shapes (components of 2, 4, or 9 with size <=2 cells) are cleared from panels and relocated to the bottom-left of the panel (up to 3 per panel, starting from left edge), but this ignores shape connectivity across panel boundaries or larger components; in train 1 generated, small 2's and 4's are over-consolidated and misplaced, while expected keeps some dispersed.
 * Maroon (8) components are found via flood-fill (4-connected), sorted by max row (bottom-to-top), and shifted up by min(5, available space above per column), but shifting clears originals and places shifted versions; subtlety: space calculation uses min across columns in the component, but doesn't account for overlapping shifts or panel constraints— in train 1 generated, 8's are shifted too much or in wrong clusters (e.g., row 2 has scattered 8's vs. expected clustered in row 2 cols 17-20).
 * 9's (orange?) are repositioned right-to-left per row, moving rightward to the position immediately after the rightmost 2 or 4 in the same panel/row if space (background) is available; key miss: it only moves if a candidate exists left of current position, and stays if not— in train 1 generated, 9's in row 12 are placed at cols 3-5 and 15-17 but expected has none visible (possibly cleared or merged); also ignores vertical alignment or multi-row components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right, no diagonals), and operations are panel-local for small shapes but global for maroons and 9's; easy to miss: don't merge across panels, and limit placements to avoid overwriting non-background.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., train 1: 13x26, train 2: 25x26, test: ~30x28?), so functions must handle variable h/w; colors like 1 (dark blue?), 3 (green?), 7 (light green?) seem static or panel separators, not to be moved.
 * Overall: Preserve non-target elements (e.g., 1's, 3's, 7's as backgrounds or frames); process in sequence (small shapes first, then maroons, then 9's) to avoid overwriting; expected outputs show stylized comic art with 8's forming figures, 9's as highlights near 2/4, and small shapes reduced/minimalized.
 * Subtle: In expected train 1, some 2's appear in unexpected places (e.g., row 2 col 21), suggesting not all small shapes are cleared—perhaps only isolated <=2 size, and originals might persist if >2 or connected differently.
 * Another subtlety: Maroon shifts are capped at 5, but only if space exists above (checking upward from min row per col); in train 2 generated, 8's are shifted prematurely, creating gaps not in expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all clearing/shifting operations; used successfully in all examples to detect 5, 1, or 7.)

```python
def identify_dividing_bars(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < w:
        col = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != background:
            start = c
            color = col[0]
            c += 1
            while c < w:
                col_next = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
                if len(set(col_next)) == 1 and col_next[0] == color:
                    c += 1
                else:
                    break
            end = c - 1
            bars.append((start, end, color))
        else:
            c += 1
    return bars
```
(This detects contiguous full-height vertical bars of uniform non-bg color, crucial for panel division; works well but assumes no gaps in bars—helpful for train 1/2 panel splits around cols 12-13.)

```python
def identify_panels(bars: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    if not bars:
        return [(0, w - 1, 0, h - 1)] if w > 0 and h > 0 else []
    panels = []
    left = 0
    for start, end, _ in bars:
        if left < start:
            panels.append((left, start - 1, 0, h - 1))
        left = end + 1
    if left < w:
        panels.append((left, w - 1, 0, h - 1))
    return panels
```
(This derives rectangular panels (left, right, top=0, bottom=h-1) between bars; useful for localizing small shape processing, but assumes top-to-bottom full height—panels in examples are horizontal strips.)

```python
def find_maroon_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] == 8:
                num = 8
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == 8:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, num))
    return components
```
(This performs flood-fill to extract connected 8-components; helpful for shifting, but sorting by max row (bottom-first) is key—used in code but shifts too aggressively in examples.)

(The small shape merging logic in the main program is partially helpful for detecting <=2 size components of 2/4/9 via local flood-fill, but broken for placement: it collects all small but only places first 3 at bottom-left, ignoring per-panel counts or originals >2; the 9-repositioning loop is useful but flawed in candidate selection—only moves left-of-current 2/4 positions, leading to no-move cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies background, bars, and panels in both trainings (e.g., train 1 bars at cols 12-13 as 4's, splitting left/right panels), and extracts maroon components accurately, but fails on small shape handling: in train 1, it clears and over-places 2/4/9 at bottoms (e.g., row 12 has extra 9's at left/right), while expected disperses or omits some (e.g., no bottom placements, 9's integrated differently); in train 2, small 2/9 placements create invalid clusters (e.g., row 11 has 2's/9's not in expected).
 * Maroon shifting works partially (detects clusters), but over-shifts or miscalculates space: train 1 generated has 8's scattered in rows 1-4/8-10 (e.g., row 1 cols 6-8), vs. expected clustered in row 2 cols 17-20 and row 4 col 17; train 2 generated shifts 8's too early (e.g., row 11 has 8's in left panel, but expected has them in row 12-13 right panel with 9's nearby).
 * 9-repositioning is mostly broken: in train 1, it places 9's in row 12 left/right but expected has 9's embedded (e.g., row 3 col 18, row 5 col 21); in train 2, generated puts 9's in row 11 col 19 and row 18 col 6, but expected has them in row 18 col 6 (partial match) and row 19 col 6 (shifted wrong).
 * Overall, sequence is logical (small first, then maroon, then 9), but ignores component size >2 (expected preserves larger 2/4/8), and placement overwrites backgrounds incorrectly; train 1 mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (e.g., expected row 3 has 8's+2 mix, generated has isolated 8's); train 2 mismatches by introducing extra 8/9 in wrong panels.
 * Function for small shape detection is helpful but incomplete (needs to skip >2 or connected to larger); bar/panel functions are solid and reusable.
 * No other prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of panel division and component extraction, but not full rearrangement rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it retains too many original elements without proper consolidation/shifting (e.g., scattered 8's in rows 2-3 cols 4-8/10-11, 9's in rows 6-7/18-19 cols 16-17/7-8, but expected likely clusters 8's upward into figures and moves 9's adjacent to 2's in right panel cols 14-15).
 * It fails to clear/merge small 2/4/9: e.g., isolated 2's in rows 2-17 cols 14-15 persist, but expected would relocate <=2 size to bottoms; 9's in row 29 col 0 seem un repositioned left of 2's.
 * Maroon (8) components are not shifted up enough or at all in some cases (e.g., row 3 has 8's at original positions, but with bg=7 dominant, space above should allow min(5) shift, clustering them higher like in train expected).
 * Panels seem misidentified (bars possibly at cols 2/26 as 4/3? but code assumes full-height; generated has vertical 1's at cols 0-1, suggesting left frame not treated as bar, leading to one big panel and no local merging).
 * Overall, output looks like minimally processed input with some anomalies (e.g., row 6 has 3 in col 2, possibly unhandled color), not matching stylized comic rules—e.g., no bottom placements for small shapes, 9's not snapped right of 2's per row/panel; unknown why 4's fill top rows entirely (perhaps bg confusion, but 7 is more common).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 23:07:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

- **Maroon shapes and small Light Blue pixels**: Light Blue pixels (1-4 pixels, holes=0) are consistently adjacent to or within the bounding box of Maroon shapes in inputs. In outputs, these Light Blue pixels relocate near the transformed Maroon shapes, indicating an attachment-based interaction that affects positional relocation of the Maroon (e.g., from left/input side to right/output side in train 1; from top to bottom in train 2). Pixel count of attached Light Blue remains conserved (e.g., 2-pixel clusters stay 2 pixels).

- **Maroon shapes and small Red/Dark Red pixels**: Red or Dark Red pixels (1-2 pixels, holes=0) are consistently positioned adjacent to Maroon shapes in inputs, often as protrusions. In outputs, these pixels relocate in proximity to the transformed Maroon, suggesting an attachment that influences the Maroon's positional or minor shape adjustment (bbox dimensions change, but total Maroon pixels conserved at 19 in train 1, 23 in train 2). Consistent across both trains.

- **Maroon shapes and small Yellow pixels**: Yellow pixels (1-3 pixels, holes=0) appear attached or near Maroon shapes in inputs. Outputs show these Yellow pixels repositioned near transformed Maroons, implying an interaction affecting movement direction (rightward in train 1, downward in train 2). Counts conserved (e.g., single pixels remain single).

- **Background panels and hole count**: Central background panels (Orange in train 1, Blue in train 2) consistently have holes reduced in outputs (2 to 1 per panel in train 1; 4 to 2 in train 2), with corresponding pixel increases (+1 per panel in train 1, +3 total in train 2). This suggests an interaction where foreground elements (e.g., Maroon or small pixels) affect background properties, possibly by partial filling or edge interaction. Side panels (Blue/Yellow/Red in train 1; Yellow/Dark Red/Red/Green in train 2) remain unchanged (holes=0, pixels fixed).

- **Position to transformation**: Input positions of Maroon shapes and attachments (left/top relative to dividers) consistently map to output positions on the opposite side (right/bottom), with bbox shifts (e.g., x-increase in train 1, y-increase in train 2). No other position-to-color changes observed consistently.

### Unknowns
- Exact transformation mechanics (e.g., how specific attachment colors dictate shift vector, rotation, or minor pixel adjustments in Maroon bbox) cannot be explained from bbox/pixel data alone; requires grid visualization to confirm connectivity.
- Green elements appear only in train 2 (small attachments and bottom panel); no consistent interaction across both trains, so excluded.
- No consistent hole interactions in foreground shapes (all holes=0); background hole reduction mechanism relative to specific foreground components is unknown.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 23:08:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a falling blocks or gravity-based puzzle (similar to games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Puyo Puyo) where numbered blocks (representing colors or types) fall downward under gravity within a grid, but with rules that likely involve connected groups of the same number falling as units, potential matching/removal of adjacent same-number blocks, and rebuilding the grid after falls. The goal is to simulate one step of falling and settling, resulting in a new grid configuration.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks fall downward (toward higher row indices, assuming row 0 is top) but only until they hit another block or the bottom; independent per-cell falling doesn't work, as seen in mismatches where groups shift together.
 * Connected components of the same number likely fall as rigid units if adjacent (horizontally or vertically), preserving their shape during descent, rather than per-column independent movement—this explains why simple column gravity scrambles group positions in expected outputs.
 * No explicit empty cells (0s) are visible in inputs/outputs; all cells seem filled with numbers (1-9), so "empty" might be implicit or handled differently (e.g., gaps created by falling but not shown, or the grid is always dense).
 * Matching rules may apply: adjacent (3+ in a row/column) same numbers might disappear before or after falling, creating space for further drops, but this isn't simulated in the attempt—subtle because outputs show rearranged but not removed blocks.
 * Grid is represented as List[List[int]] with rows as outer lists; falling affects vertical positions but may involve horizontal stability for connected blobs.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s in train 1/2) seem fixed or "floor" layers that don't move, suggesting gravity only applies above certain stable bases.
 * Subtle: Rotations, merges, or color-specific behaviors (e.g., 5s as background?) might occur, but easy to miss without full rules; outputs show specific repositions like 8s/9s clustering differently.
 * All attempts must preserve grid dimensions and number distributions—no creation/destruction except possibly via matches.
 * Consider iterative falling: blocks may need multiple passes until stable, as single-pass column gravity leaves floating groups in generated vs. expected.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple per-column gravity, which worked for basic downward movement in isolated columns (e.g., stacking non-empties at bottom) but failed to handle connected groups across columns, leading to scrambled positions.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps many 5s static and drops 8s/9s/2s/1s/4s incorrectly per column (e.g., row 3 has 9 in col 18 generated vs. expected 8s cluster in cols 17-20; row 5 has 8s/9s/4/2 misplaced vs. expected 8s/9s/2s in specific blob shapes); unknown why blobs don't preserve shape, but likely because no component detection.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated drops 8s/9s/2s/4s/3s per column, creating floating or misaligned groups (e.g., row 11 has 8s/9s scattered vs. expected clustered 2s/9s in cols 17-20 and 8s below; row 18 has 9 in col 6 generated vs. expected 8s/7s cluster; bottom 3s intact but upper layers wrong); simple gravity ignores horizontal connections.
 * extract_columns and build_grid are helpful for column-wise ops but broken for this puzzle as they enable only independent falls, not group-aware simulation (still useful as building blocks).
 * apply_gravity is unhelpful/broken: Assumes empty=0 (but no 0s in grids), moves all non-empties to bottom per column without checking connections or stability, causing over-dropping and loss of structure (don't use in future without mods for groups).
 * No detection of matches/removals, missing potential disappearances that create fall space.
 * Core issue: Treats grid as independent columns instead of holistic structure with blobs; this partially understands vertical falling (some bottom stacking matches) but misses horizontal adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies simplistic per-column stacking (e.g., all 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s/2s/1s dropped to bottoms of their columns, creating dense lower layers with floating mismatches like isolated 9s/8s in upper rows), but ignores connected groups—e.g., clusters of 8s/9s in cols 4-6 and 20-23 should likely fall as units preserving shapes, not scatter vertically per column (generated has 8s split across rows 3-11 in col 4 vs. expected probable tight drop to row 5-7 or similar). This results in unnatural fragmentation (e.g., row 6 has scattered 3/8/7 vs. expected consolidated blobs) and doesn't account for potential matches (e.g., multiple adjacent 7s might clear). Without expected, it visually resembles over-simplified Tetris drops but fails training logic, so likely wrong; needs group detection to handle test's complex 7/8/9 clusters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformations on colored grids (likely representing images or patterns with numbers as colors), where rules govern pixel changes, shape movements, or mergers, often involving special values like 9 (possibly holes or temporary markers) interacting with backgrounds and other shapes. The goal is to apply consistent rules across examples to produce expected outputs, such as relocating or erasing elements while preserving borders and overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color, but transformations must preserve static borders (e.g., 1's, 4's) and not alter unrelated areas.
 * 9's appear to represent temporary or "hole" pixels that can be transferred, merged, or removed based on context: non-isolated 9's (adjacent to non-background) seem to blend into background or shapes, but isolated 9's may persist or move.
 * Shape movements or expansions: In training 1 expected, 8's expand or shift (e.g., row 2 has 8's where generated has 5's; row 3 has a 2 intrusion), suggesting rules for object propagation or filling holes rather than simple erasure.
 * Hole reduction: Comment in code mentions "hole reduction," but expected outputs show 9's relocating (e.g., training 1 row 3 has 9 in expected but not generated; training 2 has 9's in specific positions like row 11 col 19).
 * Subtle element: Connectivity matters—diagonal or full 8-directional adjacency might be needed for "isolation," as 4-directional (used in code) misses some interactions (e.g., training 2 generated keeps some 8's/9's isolated incorrectly).
 * Color-specific rules: 9's interact with specific shapes (e.g., 8's in training 1, 2's/8's in training 2), not just background; over-generalizing to all non-bg neighbors fails when shapes like 2 or 3 intrude.
 * Grid consistency: Outputs must match exact positions; small mismatches (e.g., a single 5 vs. 8) indicate rule gaps, like failing to handle multi-step transfers or conditional movements based on neighboring shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Preserve "divider" or border elements (e.g., 4's in training 2 rows 2-23); don't flood entire areas; account for vertical/horizontal asymmetries in shapes.
 * All attempts so far focus on 9-to-bg transfer, but ignore shape relocation (e.g., 8's moving right/down in expected vs. static in generated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, used in both trainings and test; essential for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def is_isolated(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Note: May need 8 directions for full connectivity
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            if g[nr][nc] != bg:
                return False
    return True
```
(This checks 4-directional isolation of 9's from non-background; helpful but limited—subtleties like diagonal connections may require expansion; used to avoid changing isolated 9's, which persists some correctly but misses mergers.)

```python
def transfer_pixels(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = get_background(g)
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if out[r][c] == 9 and not is_isolated(r, c, out, bg):
                out[r][c] = bg
    return out
```
(This applies the core transfer logic; partially helpful for non-isolated 9's but broken for cases needing movement instead of erasure, as seen in trainings.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on erasing non-isolated 9's to background, which worked partially for reducing some "small shapes" but failed to relocate or expand other elements (e.g., 8's static in generated vs. shifted in expected).
 * Training 1: Generated erased some 9's correctly (e.g., row 6 col 9 stays 9 as isolated?), but mismatched by keeping 5's where expected has 8's/2's (e.g., row 2 all 5's vs. expected 8's in row 2; row 3 has 9 at col 18 in generated but expected has 8's and 9 elsewhere; unknown why 8-shapes didn't propagate).
 * Training 1: Missed hole filling or shape intrusion (e.g., expected row 4 has 9 at col 18, but generated has it at col 18 unchanged? Wait, generated row 3 col 18 is 9, but expected row 3 has 8's/2; differences in 8-blob positions and a 4/9 mismatch in row 4).
 * Training 2: Generated erased some 9's (e.g., row 18 col 6 becomes 1? but expected has 8's moving), but kept invalid 8's/2's (e.g., row 5 has 8's where expected has all 1's; row 11 has 2's/9 where expected relocates them; row 17 has 8's in generated vs. expected 1's with 8's lower).
 * Training 2: Failed to collapse or move shapes upward/downward (e.g., expected simplifies upper rows to 1's, but generated retains scattered 8's/2's; unknown reason for not detecting multi-pixel "small shapes").
 * Overall: No training passed; attempt demonstrates partial understanding of 9's as transferable but ignores broader rules like shape adjacency mergers or position-specific changes; is_isolated is helpful but too narrow (4-dir vs. 8-dir?).
 * No object extraction attempted yet, but would be essential for identifying "small shapes" beyond single 9's (e.g., connected components of 8's/9's).
 * transfer_pixels is partially helpful for bg blending but not for the puzzle's apparent "movement" or "filling" mechanics; don't rely solely on it without shape detection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies the same 9-to-bg erasure as trainings, changing scattered 9's (e.g., row 19 col 8 to 7?, row 20 col 20 to 7?, row 25 col 4 to 7?, row 26 col 5 to 7?) but leaves shapes like 8's and 3's intact without apparent movement or expansion.
 * Unlike trainings, test has more 9's in lower rows (e.g., rows 25-29), but output erases non-isolated ones without addressing potential shape interactions (e.g., 8's in row 3 col 4-5 stay, but if rules involve propagation like in training 1 expected, they should shift).
 * Output mismatches likely expected by over-simplifying: e.g., row 6 has 1/4/8's unchanged, but puzzles may require filling holes with adjacent colors (7's?); background seems 7 (common), but 4's/1's/2's/3's persist without merger, suggesting incomplete rules.
 * No sense of "correctness" without expected, but based on training failures, this likely errs by not handling 8/9 clusters as movable objects (e.g., the 8-blob in rows 3-5 cols 4-8 may need to expand rightward like training 1's 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to simulate a block-dropping game on a grid where numbers represent colored blocks, with upward gravity (blocks move toward the top of the grid, i.e., lower row indices), removal of connected groups of three or more 9s, and a second application of gravity after removal to settle the grid. The goal is to process an input grid through these mechanics to produce a stable final state, preserving non-9 blocks and handling connectivity correctly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the grid, used to identify empty space for gravity drops.
 * Connected components are defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background number; single blocks are treated as components of size 1.
 * Gravity is upward (delta=-1, moving to lower row indices), and entire components drop as rigid units; the drop distance for a component is the minimum clear space above any of its blocks in the same column.
 * Components must be processed in a specific order during gravity: sort by descending max row (process "lower" components first), then descending min row, to avoid interference from higher-dropping components.
 * Removal targets only connected groups of 9s with size >=3; smaller 9 groups or singles stay, and removal sets them to background without triggering chain reactions beyond the second gravity pass.
 * After first gravity, remove 9 groups, then apply gravity again; no further removals or iterations.
 * Grid is rectangular; assume consistent row lengths, but handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Subtle: When clearing a component for drop calculation, the grid temporarily has holes, but drops are per-column and min across the component; if min_d=0, restore without moving.
 * Subtle: Gravity loop continues until no movement, but in practice, one pass per phase may suffice if stable.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order prevents components from blocking each other incorrectly; without it, drops can overlap or skip.
 * Easy to miss: 9 removal happens only once, post-first gravity, and only on connected 9s >=3; other numbers never remove.
 * Consideration: Outputs are flattened rows (lists of ints), but grids are 2D; preserve structure but print as 1D per row.
 * Consideration: In example 2, many 1s consolidate but some structures like 8s and 2s partially survive or reposition differently, suggesting complex interactions.

    return min_d
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies background via frequency and uses 4-way connected components, which is essential for grouping.
 * Gravity implementation moves components as units with min drop distance, which works for basic settling but fails in ordering: sorting by (-max_i, -min_i) processes "lower" first, but in training example 1, it leads to incorrect repositioning of 8s and 5s (e.g., generated has stacked 8s in row 2-3 that don't match expected scattered 8s and 2s integration).
 * In training example 1, post-removal gravity doesn't properly handle surviving 9s or 1s; generated ends with uniform 5s in many rows, but expected has varied placements like 8s in row 3 cols 17-20, a 2 in row 3 col 21, and specific 4/8/9 mixes in row 4—differences suggest over-dropping or incorrect clearing/restoration when min_d=0.
 * In training example 2, initial gravity consolidates 1s and 8s too aggressively upward, creating uniform 1 rows (e.g., generated rows 8-11 all 1s in many cols), but expected keeps more structure like isolated 2/9/8 groups lower (e.g., expected row 12 has 2s and 9, row 13 has 4/8/9/8)—this indicates the component processing order or drop calculation ignores inter-component collisions after clearing.
 * 9 removal works (groups >=3 cleared), but in example 2, generated removes some 8s/9s incorrectly or fails second gravity, leading to leftover 9s in row 6 and uniform bottoms, unlike expected where 8s form lines in rows 13-14/18-21 but 9s are isolated or removed selectively.
 * The apply_gravity loop with while True and moved flag is helpful for stability, but in practice, it over-applies in examples, homogenizing grids (e.g., all 2s at top in example 2 generated, but expected has 2s integrated lower).
 * remove_large_nines_groups is correct and relevant, as it targets only 9s >=3 connected.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are core, but compute_drop_distance may undercount if grid changes mid-drop (though it clears first, so potentially okay—issue likely in sequencing).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive stacking of 7s in nearly all middle rows (rows 3-30+ mostly 7s with some 2s/3s/9s sprinkled), and uniform 4s at the very top, which homogenizes the input's mixed 1/7/8/9/3/2/4 distribution unrealistically.
 * Input has diverse clusters (e.g., 7s scattered, 8s in groups, 3s at right bottom, 2s in cols 15-16), but output treats most non-4/3 as 7s dropping fully upward, ignoring distinct component identities—e.g., 8s and 9s should form separate groups post-gravity/removal, not merge into 7 stacks.
 * No 9 removal evident (input has potential 9 groups, like row 3 col7/ row4 col6, but output has stray 9s without clearing >=3), and second gravity seems to collapse everything without preserving shapes, unlike training expects where structures like 8-lines or 2-clusters survive in specific positions.
 * Bottom 3s are preserved but isolated; overall, output lacks the expected partial consolidation (e.g., 7s should cluster but not dominate all space, per training patterns), suggesting the program fails on larger/mixed grids by over-simplifying drops.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a gravity-based puzzle where the grid represents a 2D board (likely rows from top to bottom, with row 0 at the top), and non-background cells form connected "blobs" (4-directional connectivity of same or different numbers?) that fall downward independently after being cleared, stacking on top of existing structures or the bottom, simulating physics like in a match-3 or falling blocks game. The goal is to process blobs from bottom to top (highest row first) to apply gravity correctly without interference from lower blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common value in the grid, but in complex grids, ties or non-zero backgrounds might need handling (though not seen here).
 * Blobs are connected components of any non-background cells (not necessarily same number), using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal doesn't count, which is standard but easy to miss if 8-directional is assumed.
 * Blobs must be processed in order from lowest (highest row index, assuming row 0 is top) to highest to avoid upper blobs falling through cleared lower spaces incorrectly.
 * When computing drop distance for a blob, identify all columns it occupies, find the max row (lowest position) in that blob per column, then count consecutive background cells below it in the updated grid (after clearing previous blobs); take the MINIMUM drop across those columns to ensure the blob falls as a rigid unit without splitting.
 * After clearing a blob (set to background), drop it by the computed distance and place it in the new positions, but only if the new row < height; overhanging parts might be lost, but not seen in examples.
 * Subtlety: Dropping happens sequentially on a copy of the grid, so changes from lower blobs affect upper ones' drop calculations—processing bottom-up is crucial to simulate realistic gravity.
 * Blobs might overlap in columns after dropping, causing stacking; the min-drop ensures cohesion.
 * Grid is ragged in output (flattened rows), but input is 2D list; preserve width.
 * Easy to miss: Numbers within a blob can differ (e.g., 8,9 in same blob), so connectivity is by position, not value—blobs are groups of any non-background.
 * After all drops, unchanged top rows (all background) should remain as-is.
 * Potential edge: Empty grid or all background returns unchanged; single-cell blobs drop fully if possible.
 * In examples, some blobs seem to split or not connect properly, suggesting blob finding might over/under-connect based on value equality (but code doesn't require same value, which is good).

                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y, num = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y, num))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != background:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny, g[nx][ny]))
                if blob:
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```
(This DFS-based blob finder is helpful for extracting connected non-background groups; stores position and value, which is key for later placement. It's correct in principle but may fail if blobs need same-value connectivity—examples suggest not.)

```python
def sort_blobs(blobs: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    def get_max_row(blob: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int:
        return max(i for i, _, _ in blob)
    return sorted(blobs, key=get_max_row, reverse=True)
```
(This sorts by lowest point of blob, processing bottom-up; essential for sequential gravity.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background and finds blobs via DFS, which works for connectivity, but fails to apply gravity properly in both training examples—blobs are cleared and dropped, but resulting positions don't match expected falling patterns (e.g., in Train 1, upper 8/9 blobs don't drop into cleared spaces correctly, leaving gaps or misplaced cells).
 * In Train 1, generated output keeps most top rows unchanged but mangles lower blobs (e.g., row 7 has a single 4 misplaced, row 8 has scattered 8/1/5 instead of consolidated drop); expected shows specific 8/9 groups dropping and reshaping, suggesting drop calculation ignores updated grid state or min-distance is wrong (unknown why, but drop_d seems too small or columns misidentified).
 * In Train 2, generated has excessive unchanged rows and blobs like 8/9 not dropping fully (e.g., row 16 has partial 8's, row 17 has fragmented 8/7/1); expected consolidates 8/9/2 into lower positions with proper stacking, indicating the sequential clearing/placing doesn't propagate space correctly—upper blobs fall as if lower ones weren't cleared.
 * compute_drop_distance finds min drop over blob columns based on max_i per col, which is good for rigid drop, but in practice overestimates obstacles (uses new_g after prior clears, but examples show it doesn't "see" the cleared space below).
 * place_blob only places if new_i < height, which is safe, but may clip blobs (not an issue here); however, it doesn't handle if drop causes overlap with uncleared lower blobs.
 * apply_gravity processes sorted_blobs but applies to a copy (new_g), which is correct, yet outputs show blobs not stacking—perhaps sorting reverse=True (bottom-first) is right, but drop calc assumes static below, missing chain reactions.
 * Overall, blob finding seems functional (captures groups like 8/9), but gravity simulation is broken: drops are minimal or zero for many, leading to near-identical grids; unhelpful if connectivity required same values (but code doesn't, and examples have mixed).
 * No unhelpful functions standout, but the full program integrates them poorly—e.g., no validation that blobs don't overlap post-drop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows many repetitive rows of [1,1,7,7,... ,2,2,7,7,... ,3,3] from row 2 onward, with scattered changes in lower rows (e.g., row 3 has 8/9 inserted oddly, row 6 has 3/4 misplaced, row 29 has 9/8/1 at end), but top rows are all 4's unchanged, suggesting minimal dropping happened.
 * Expected should simulate full gravity: identify blobs (e.g., 7's, 8/9 groups, 2's, 3's), clear bottom ones first (like lower 8/9/2), drop them to bottom (possibly stacking on 3's or filling to row ~29), then upper blobs (like top 7's) drop into those spaces; generated has no such consolidation—7's barely move, 8/9 fragments stay high, 2's static, indicating drop_distance computes 0 or 1 for most, ignoring cleared paths.
 * Differences: Generated keeps structure almost intact (e.g., row 12 has 2's in place, but expected would shift everything down); lower rows have artifacts like isolated 9/8 in row 29, unlike expected rigid blob falls; overall, it looks like partial/incomplete simulation, not matching physics where blobs should cascade down fully.
 * To handle test, need to ensure drop calc scans the entire column below max_i for background runs in the progressively updated grid; current min(ds) per blob is right in theory but fails in practice (perhaps bug in cols=set(j for _,j,_ in blob) missing multi-col spans, or while loop in compute_drop_distance stops prematurely).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal appears to be cleaning up or reconstructing a scene by identifying a dominant color (likely the background or main element), filling small non-dominant components within its bounding box, and repositioning specific elements like maroon (color 8) toward a central area, while preserving key structures like borders, objects, and anomalies (e.g., 9s as special markers). The process aims to match expected "clean" or "corrected" grids that maintain object shapes, positions, and details without over-filling or mis-shifting elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Dominant color (e.g., 5 in Train 1, 1 or 4 in Train 2, 7 in test) must be accurately identified as the most common non-background color, but not over-applied to erase important small features like isolated 9s, thin borders (e.g., color 4 lines), or object details.
 * Bounding box should tightly enclose the dominant color's main area to avoid processing irrelevant parts of the grid, but must handle irregular shapes without excluding connected components.
 * Small components (< threshold, e.g., 10 cells) of non-dominant colors inside the bbox should be filled with dominant color only if they are noise/holes; do not fill structural elements like borders (4), object protrusions (e.g., 8 clusters), or anomalies (9s, which seem to represent eyes or special points that must remain).
 * Maroon (8) elements represent objects (e.g., perhaps a character or shape) that need repositioning toward the grid's center, but the shift must be precise (not a fixed 5-column right shift, as it overwrites and misplaces them); consider vertical/horizontal centering based on bbox or grid midpoint, and avoid clearing originals to background (0) if they overlap other elements.
 * Preserve borders and frames (e.g., 1s on sides, 4s as dividers) without alteration, as they define the puzzle structure; top/bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s) are often uniform backgrounds that should not be touched.
 * Anomalies like 9s are rare and must stay in place as they likely indicate key features (e.g., eyes in a face); 0s are empty/neutral spaces to fill selectively, but not all (e.g., larger gaps might be intentional).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 13x26 in Train 1, 26x26 in Train 2, 30x28 in test), so functions must handle rectangular inputs dynamically; connected components should use 4-directional adjacency, but only within bbox to avoid global flooding.
 * Subtle elements: In Train 1, expected output repositions 8s into a more central blob with 9s intact, without filling internal 0s prematurely; in Train 2, small 8/9 clusters and 2s must form specific patterns (e.g., a face or symbol) without being erased. Over-shifting 8s can collide with other colors, creating mismatches.
 * Threshold for "small" components needs tuning (10 may be too low, missing medium noise); do not fill if component touches bbox edges, as it might be a border extension.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes object recognition (e.g., extracting blobs of 8s as movable entities) over blind filling, with rules favoring preservation of visual motifs like symmetry or alignment.

def fill_small_components(g: List[List[int]], dominant: int, bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], threshold: int = 10) -> List[List[int]]:
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
    if max_r < min_r:
        return out
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = set()
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if (r, c) not in visited and g[r][c] != dominant:
                component = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited.add((r, c))
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
                        if (min_r <= nr <= max_r and min_c <= nc <= max_c and
                            0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited and g[nr][nc] != dominant):
                            visited.add((nr, nc))
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if len(component) < threshold:
                    for pr, pc in component:
                        out[pr][pc] = dominant
    return out
```
(This performs DFS-based connected component filling within bbox, helpful for noise removal; works partially but over-fills non-noise like 9s or small 8 parts; threshold=10 is a starting point but needs exceptions for special colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies dominant color and bbox in all cases, and fills some small 0/9 holes appropriately (e.g., scattered 0s in Train 1 rows 4-7 become 5s in generated, matching expected in parts).
 * Fill_small_components works for tiny noise (e.g., isolated 0s in Train 2) but fails on medium components or specials: in Train 1, it incorrectly fills some 8-adjacent 0s and leaves 9s unfilled when they should stay; in Train 2, it erases small 2/9 clusters (e.g., row 11 generated has no 2s where expected has them) and over-fills 8s prematurely.
 * move_maroon_toward_center is broken/unhelpful: fixed 5-column right shift misplaces 8s entirely (e.g., Train 1 generated shifts 8s in rows 4-10 rightward into 5s/0s, creating smears not in expected; Train 2 scatters 8s into borders, losing shape); it clears originals to 0, which introduces new holes, and ignores vertical centering or collision detection.
 * Overall, attempt understands component-based cleaning but misses subtlety of preserving object integrity (8s as movable blobs, 9s as fixed points) and precise repositioning; Train 1 generated mismatches expected in 8/9 placements (e.g., expected row 2 has 8s at cols 17-20, generated has them elsewhere; unknown why 8s aren't clustered centrally) and row 8 has extra 1s/0s; Train 2 mismatches in lower half (e.g., expected rows 17-23 have specific 8/9 patterns for a shape, generated fills them with 1s/0s).
 * No object extraction function present, but one would be essential to identify and relocate 8-blobs as units (e.g., find connected 8 components, compute their centroid, shift to grid center).
 * Program copies grid correctly and uses neutral 0, but doesn't handle multi-dominant areas (e.g., Train 2 has competing 1/4) or edge cases like 8s outside bbox.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it over-fills with dominant 7 across most of the grid (e.g., rows 7-30 are nearly uniform 7s with side 1/2/3 borders), erasing likely object details like clustered 8s/9s/4s (e.g., row 5 has 8s scattered and partially filled, but expected probably preserves a central 8-shape with 9-eyes intact, similar to Train 1/2 patterns).
 * Small components like 0/9 in rows 3-6 (e.g., 9 at row 5 col 5) are filled or ignored incorrectly, creating solid 7 blocks where holes/eyes should remain; 8s in rows 3-12 are shifted/misplaced (e.g., row 9 has 8s at end, but likely should be centered without overwriting 7s).
 * Borders (1s left, 3s right, 4s top) are preserved somewhat, but internal structures (e.g., row 6's 3/4 anomalies) are lost to 7-filling, mismatched from trainings where such details stay; the uniform lower rows suggest over-aggressive filling without bbox limiting or object protection.
 * No clear central repositioning of 8s (they're smeared right/down), and extra 0s persist in places (e.g., row 9 cols 20-22), indicating the shift function failed similarly to trainings; overall, it looks like a "washed out" version missing the visual puzzle's key elements (e.g., a face or symbol formed by 8/9).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, likely representing a "canvas" or image that needs to be vertically flipped or reversed between uniform border rows (top and bottom), while preserving those borders, to match evolving patterns across multiple frames or examples. The goal is to process a sequence of grids (as a list of rows) and output the transformed version that aligns with expected visual changes, such as correcting orientations or symmetries in drawn objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify uniform rows (all elements identical) at the top and bottom as fixed borders that should not be altered or included in any reversal.
 * The "canvas" is the non-uniform middle section between borders; it must be reversed vertically (i.e., flip the order of rows in this section) to correct the orientation, but only if it matches the puzzle's visual logic—subtly, not all middle rows may need full reversal if they contain partial patterns or evolving elements.
 * Patterns in the middle often represent "objects" or shapes (e.g., sequences of 8s forming a blob or line, 9s as highlights, or mixed numbers like 1,2 for structures) that evolve across rows; reversal should preserve their internal structure but flip their vertical position to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Uniformity check must be strict (empty rows are uniform, but grids are non-empty); borders may vary in thickness (multiple consecutive uniform rows); reversal applies only to the canvas, but if borders are misidentified (e.g., a nearly uniform row with one outlier is not uniform), the canvas slice is wrong, leading to partial reversals or unchanged rows.
 * Across examples, top borders are often solid (e.g., all 1s or 5s), bottom are solid (e.g., all 2s or 3s), and canvas has asymmetric patterns that need flipping to symmetrize or correct (e.g., in training 1, row 3 expected has 8s ending with 2, suggesting a shape adjustment post-reversal).
 * Easy to miss: Reversal is row-order flip, not element-level; some rows in canvas may appear uniform after reversal but weren't before; evolving frames mean the program must handle varying border sizes and non-symmetric objects; test grids have wider dimensions (28 columns vs 26 in training), so code must be dimension-agnostic.
 * Considerations from attempts: Over-reversing includes border rows if uniformity is mischecked; under-reversing leaves canvas intact when it should flip; objects like 8-clusters or 9-dots may need extraction to verify post-reversal shapes, but simple reversal alone fails if borders shift per row.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)
```
(This function correctly identifies uniform rows for border detection; it's reliable and should be reused.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```
(This is the core program from the attempt; it correctly slices and reverses the canvas but fails on border precision and full pattern matching—helpful as a base but needs refinement for object-aware reversal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and skips multi-row uniform borders (e.g., in training 1, it skips top all-1s/5s and bottom all-2s correctly in many rows), preserving them unchanged, which matches expected outputs where borders stay static.
 * Reversal of the canvas works partially for simple cases (e.g., in training 1 rows 1-2 and 10-13, generated matches expected all-5s/1s with 4,4 inserts), but fails when canvas contains asymmetric objects: e.g., training 1 row 3 generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,9,9,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,2,2]—generated has 8,9,9,8 (wrong shape, extra 9s, no 2 inserts) instead of solid 8s with 2s, suggesting reversal didn't align the blob correctly or mis-sliced canvas.
 * In training 1 row 4, generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2]—minor mismatch in canvas reversal (e.g., 4 placement wrong, 9 not flipped properly), indicating border detection skipped too few rows or reversal order is off for evolving patterns.
 * Training 1 row 5 generated has scattered 2s and 8s not matching expected clustered 8s with 2s; row 6 has 1s and 8s misplaced vs expected 1,8,8,9 cluster—unknown why reversal creates these outliers, possibly because canvas includes semi-uniform rows.
 * Training 2 shows similar issues: borders (top all-2s, bottom all-3s, side 4,4 and 7,7) preserved well, but canvas reversal fails badly—e.g., row 11 generated [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7] vs expected [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1,7,7], where generated inserts wrong 4s instead of flipping to include 2,9 pattern; row 14 generated has scattered 8s/9s/3 not matching expected 8-clusters.
 * Overall, attempt understands border uniformity (worked for static parts) but not canvas object evolution (didn't work: reversal misaligns shapes like 8-blobs or 9-dots, leading to extra/missing numbers); no object extraction attempted, which might help verify shapes post-reversal.
 * Function `is_uniform` is helpful and correct; the slicing logic in `program` is mostly sound but broken for variable canvas content (e.g., doesn't handle intra-row patterns or why some rows stay unchanged when they should flip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate puzzle understanding, as it mostly preserves or partially reverses the canvas but mangles object patterns similarly to training failures—e.g., rows 6-7 have scattered 9s in 7-clusters ([1,1,7,7,7,9,7,...] vs likely expected solid 7s with flipped 9-position for symmetry), and row 20 has [...,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,3,3] which introduces misplaced 2s not aligning with any clear flipped shape (expected might cluster 2s/8s/9s vertically from input patterns like row 12's 9s).
 * Lower rows (e.g., 24-28) show chaotic mixes like [1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,...] and [1,1,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,...] vs input's more structured 7s/2s/3s—reversal seems to flip but not correct orientations (e.g., 8,9 clusters appear fragmented, missing expected merges or border integrations like training's 2-inserts); overall, it looks like incomplete flipping without object awareness, so borders (top all-4s, bottom all-3s?) are handled but canvas shapes (7-blobs, 2/8/9 elements) are distorted, not making visual sense as a corrected image.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to preprocess and transform the grid by identifying a background color, detecting vertical dividing bars to split the grid into panels, and applying specific rules to merge small isolated shapes, shift maroon (color 8) shapes upward within panels, and reposition light blue (color 9) shapes relative to red/yellow (colors 2/4) in the same row. The transformations aim to normalize or consolidate elements for further puzzle solving, such as object extraction or pattern matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the flattened grid; assume it's 0 or similar neutral, but confirm via Counter.
 * Dividing bars are full-height vertical columns (or sequences of columns) of uniform non-background color; they must span the entire height (h rows) with no variation in that column.
 * Panels are rectangular regions between bars (from left=0 to w-1 if no bars); each panel is defined by (left_col, right_col, top=0, bottom=h-1), assuming no horizontal divisions.
 * Small shapes to merge: Isolated pixels or tiny groups (colors 2,4,9) with <=1 neighbor (in 4 directions, within panel bounds); count self + neighbors <=2 total pixels per group, but code checks per cell.
 * Merging: Up to 3 small pixels per panel are cleared to background, then "placed" (overwritten) in the bottom row starting from left of panel; this seems like consolidating small debris to the panel's bottom-left corner.
 * Maroon (8) transformation: Shift entire vertical stacks or blobs upward by up to 5 rows (min(shift, distance to panel top)) without overlapping existing cells; track moved positions to avoid double-shifts.
 * Light blue (9) repositioning: Move to immediately right of a red/yellow (2 or 4) in the same row within the panel if possible; if no such position, try right of first global red/yellow or leave in place; avoid overwriting.
 * Process order matters: Merge small shapes first, then shift maroon, then reposition light blue; apply transformations per panel to avoid cross-panel interference.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns unchanged; single panel if no bars; small panels may have no space for placements; neighbors only count same color and within panel; shifts avoid going above panel top.
 * Subtle: "Small shapes" may include diagonals or not (code uses 4-dir orthogonal); merging only up to 3 per panel, even if more exist; light blue move only if exact row match for target, else fallback.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal bars/divisions not handled (assumes vertical only); color 9 might be part of larger shapes, but code treats individually; background != small colors; errors if no red/yellow for repositioning.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using frequency count; useful as a starting point.)

```python
def identify_dividing_bars(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < w:
        col = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != background:
            start = c
            color = col[0]
            c += 1
            while c < w:
                col_next = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
                if len(set(col_next)) == 1 and col_next[0] == color:
                    c += 1
                else:
                    break
            end = c - 1
            bars.append((start, end, color))
        else:
            c += 1
    return bars
```
(This detects contiguous full-height vertical bars of uniform non-background color; helpful for splitting grid, but assumes no gaps in bar color.)

```python
def identify_panels(bars: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    if not bars:
        return [(0, w - 1, 0, h - 1)] if w > 0 and h > 0 else []
    panels = []
    left = 0
    for start, end, _ in bars:
        if left < start:
            panels.append((left, start - 1, 0, h - 1))
        left = end + 1
    if left < w:
        panels.append((left, w - 1, 0, h - 1))
    return panels
```
(This derives panels as regions between/around bars; core for localizing transformations, but fixed to full height.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented background detection, bar/panel identification, and the three main transformations (merge small, shift maroon, reposition light blue), showing partial understanding of core rules like panel isolation and color-specific moves.
 * What worked: Background finding via Counter is robust and likely correct; bar detection handles contiguous columns well; panel derivation correctly splits regions; small shape neighbor check (4-dir, within panel) captures isolation; maroon shift logic avoids overlap and respects panel bounds.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all examples—blank error on Train 1 (possibly index out-of-bounds or empty grid handling); tuple concatenation error on Train 2 and Test (traced to reposition_light_blue: unpacking `next(...)` (tuple) with `red_yellow_pos[0]` (tuple) but fallback `red_yellow_pos[0]` when next fails, causing (tuple, tuple) but error mentions "int", likely when red_yellow_pos empty or mismatched types like pc+1 as int in condition).
 * Merge_small_shapes partially works but may over-merge (collects all small pixels then takes [:3], but doesn't group true connected components—treats isolated cells only); placement overwrites bottom-left without checking if it's background or free.
 * Transform_maroon_shapes shifts per cell, not per connected blob, potentially fragmenting shapes; min(5, r - p_top) is good but doesn't handle horizontal extent of maroon.
 * Reposition_light_blue collects global red/yellow but tries per-panel; next() fallback to red_yellow_pos[0] causes type error if no matches (unpacking tuple with potentially int-mixed); doesn't handle multiple 9s or overwriting.
 * No object extraction function attempted (e.g., to identify full shapes post-transform); program assumes fixed colors (2=red,4=yellow,8=maroon,9=light blue) without verification.
 * Overall, syntax/logic bugs prevent any output; Train 1 error unknown but possibly empty panels or h/w=0; no observed generated grids to compare, so can't verify if transformations match expected (e.g., small shapes consolidated correctly).
 * Function merge_small_shapes is buggy (small_pixels collected but merged without connectivity, placement may overlap bars); transform_maroon_shapes is helpful but incomplete for blobs; reposition_light_blue is broken (type error, unclear fallback); identify_dividing_bars is solid but misses non-full-height bars if puzzle has partial ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple"), so no grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected transformed grid.
 * Without output, can't verify if it correctly merges small 2/4/9 pixels to bottom-left, shifts 8s up by <=5 rows per panel, or moves 9s right of 2/4 in-row; likely fails early in reposition_light_blue due to empty red_yellow_pos or next() unpacking.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Assuming test grid has background 0, vertical bars (e.g., color 1 or 5 full columns), panels with scattered small 2/4/9 (isolated, <=1 neighbor each), vertical 8 stacks, and 9s near but not adjacent to 2/4—output should have panels with smalls cleared and stacked at bottom-left (up to 3 colors preserved), 8s lifted up within panel tops, 9s shifted right to touch 2/4 in row; differs from error by actually producing a valid grid.
 * Error indicates unhandled case (no red/yellow for 9 repositioning), so test likely has panels without 2/4, causing fallback failure—must fix to leave 9s in place if no targets.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid representing comic book panels divided by vertical bars, where the goal is to process and rearrange elements like small shapes (e.g., red=2, yellow=4, orange=9), maroon blobs (8), and other colors against a background, following rules for consolidation, shifting, and repositioning to match a stylized or corrected layout. The program attempts to automate this by identifying panels, merging small components, shifting maroons upward, and moving 9's adjacent to certain colors, but it fails to produce exact matches due to incorrect handling of component detection, placement logic, and panel-specific rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are defined by vertical dividing bars (full-height columns of uniform non-background color), but the code assumes all bars span the entire height and width correctly; subtle issue: bars might not always be full-height or could be interrupted, leading to misidentified panels (e.g., in train 1, panels seem split around columns 12-13 for 4's).
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common color (e.g., 5 in train 1, 1 or 7 in others), but ensure it's not confused with sparse elements; all operations clear to background.
 * Small shapes (components of 2, 4, or 9 with size <=2 cells) are cleared from panels and relocated to the bottom-left of the panel (up to 3 per panel, starting from left edge), but this ignores shape connectivity across panel boundaries or larger components; in train 1 generated, small 2's and 4's are over-consolidated and misplaced, while expected keeps some dispersed.
 * Maroon (8) components are found via flood-fill (4-connected), sorted by max row (bottom-to-top), and shifted up by min(5, available space above per column), but shifting clears originals and places shifted versions; subtlety: space calculation uses min across columns in the component, but doesn't account for overlapping shifts or panel constraints— in train 1 generated, 8's are shifted too much or in wrong clusters (e.g., row 2 has scattered 8's vs. expected clustered in row 2 cols 17-20).
 * 9's (orange?) are repositioned right-to-left per row, moving rightward to the position immediately after the rightmost 2 or 4 in the same panel/row if space (background) is available; key miss: it only moves if a candidate exists left of current position, and stays if not— in train 1 generated, 9's in row 12 are placed at cols 3-5 and 15-17 but expected has none visible (possibly cleared or merged); also ignores vertical alignment or multi-row components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right, no diagonals), and operations are panel-local for small shapes but global for maroons and 9's; easy to miss: don't merge across panels, and limit placements to avoid overwriting non-background.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., train 1: 13x26, train 2: 25x26, test: ~30x28?), so functions must handle variable h/w; colors like 1 (dark blue?), 3 (green?), 7 (light green?) seem static or panel separators, not to be moved.
 * Overall: Preserve non-target elements (e.g., 1's, 3's, 7's as backgrounds or frames); process in sequence (small shapes first, then maroons, then 9's) to avoid overwriting; expected outputs show stylized comic art with 8's forming figures, 9's as highlights near 2/4, and small shapes reduced/minimalized.
 * Subtle: In expected train 1, some 2's appear in unexpected places (e.g., row 2 col 21), suggesting not all small shapes are cleared—perhaps only isolated <=2 size, and originals might persist if >2 or connected differently.
 * Another subtlety: Maroon shifts are capped at 5, but only if space exists above (checking upward from min row per col); in train 2 generated, 8's are shifted prematurely, creating gaps not in expected.

(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all clearing/shifting operations; used successfully in all examples to detect 5, 1, or 7.)

(This detects contiguous full-height vertical bars of uniform non-bg color, crucial for panel division; works well but assumes no gaps in bars—helpful for train 1/2 panel splits around cols 12-13.)

        left = end + 1
    if left < w:
        panels.append((left, w - 1, 0, h - 1))
    return panels
```
(This derives rectangular panels (left, right, top=0, bottom=h-1) between bars; useful for localizing small shape processing, but assumes top-to-bottom full height—panels in examples are horizontal strips.)

                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == 8:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))

    return components
```
(This performs flood-fill to extract connected 8-components; helpful for shifting, but sorting by max row (bottom-first) is key—used in code but shifts too aggressively in examples.)

(The small shape merging logic in the main program is partially helpful for detecting <=2 size components of 2/4/9 via local flood-fill, but broken for placement: it collects all small but only places first 3 at bottom-left, ignoring per-panel counts or originals >2; the 9-repositioning loop is useful but flawed in candidate selection—only moves left-of-current 2/4 positions, leading to no-move cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies background, bars, and panels in both trainings (e.g., train 1 bars at cols 12-13 as 4's, splitting left/right panels), and extracts maroon components accurately, but fails on small shape handling: in train 1, it clears and over-places 2/4/9 at bottoms (e.g., row 12 has extra 9's at left/right), while expected disperses or omits some (e.g., no bottom placements, 9's integrated differently); in train 2, small 2/9 placements create invalid clusters (e.g., row 11 has 2's/9's not in expected).
 * Maroon shifting works partially (detects clusters), but over-shifts or miscalculates space: train 1 generated has 8's scattered in rows 1-4/8-10 (e.g., row 1 cols 6-8), vs. expected clustered in row 2 cols 17-20 and row 4 col 17; train 2 generated shifts 8's too early (e.g., row 11 has 8's in left panel, but expected has them in row 12-13 right panel with 9's nearby).
 * 9-repositioning is mostly broken: in train 1, it places 9's in row 12 left/right but expected has 9's embedded (e.g., row 3 col 18, row 5 col 21); in train 2, generated puts 9's in row 11 col 19 and row 18 col 6, but expected has them in row 18 col 6 (partial match) and row 19 col 6 (shifted wrong).
 * Overall, sequence is logical (small first, then maroon, then 9), but ignores component size >2 (expected preserves larger 2/4/8), and placement overwrites backgrounds incorrectly; train 1 mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (e.g., expected row 3 has 8's+2 mix, generated has isolated 8's); train 2 mismatches by introducing extra 8/9 in wrong panels.
 * Function for small shape detection is helpful but incomplete (needs to skip >2 or connected to larger); bar/panel functions are solid and reusable.
 * No other prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of panel division and component extraction, but not full rearrangement rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it retains too many original elements without proper consolidation/shifting (e.g., scattered 8's in rows 2-3 cols 4-8/10-11, 9's in rows 6-7/18-19 cols 16-17/7-8, but expected likely clusters 8's upward into figures and moves 9's adjacent to 2's in right panel cols 14-15).
 * It fails to clear/merge small 2/4/9: e.g., isolated 2's in rows 2-17 cols 14-15 persist, but expected would relocate <=2 size to bottoms; 9's in row 29 col 0 seem un repositioned left of 2's.
 * Maroon (8) components are not shifted up enough or at all in some cases (e.g., row 3 has 8's at original positions, but with bg=7 dominant, space above should allow min(5) shift, clustering them higher like in train expected).
 * Panels seem misidentified (bars possibly at cols 2/26 as 4/3? but code assumes full-height; generated has vertical 1's at cols 0-1, suggesting left frame not treated as bar, leading to one big panel and no local merging).
 * Overall, output looks like minimally processed input with some anomalies (e.g., row 6 has 3 in col 2, possibly unhandled color), not matching stylized comic rules—e.g., no bottom placements for small shapes, 9's not snapped right of 2's per row/panel; unknown why 4's fill top rows entirely (perhaps bg confusion, but 7 is more common).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity where non-background blocks connected in 4-way adjacent groups of the same color form rigid "components" that fall downward as intact units, processed from the bottom of the grid upward to avoid interference, until they stack on other blocks or the bottom, with the background color being the most common value in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection must use the most frequent color across the entire flat grid, but handle empty grids gracefully (default to 0).
 * Connected components include single blocks and are strictly same-color and 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding background.
 * Components must be processed in bottom-to-top order by sorting on the maximum row index (highest row number first, assuming row 0 is top), to simulate gravity without later drops affecting earlier ones.
 * For dropping: Each component is cleared from the grid first, then the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background spaces below the lowest point of the component in each of its occupied columns (starting from just below that lowest row in the column).
 * Dropped positions must not exceed grid bounds; if the new row would be out of bounds, the block stays or clips, but in practice, it seems to cap at grid height.
 * Subtlety: Drop calculation is per-column lowest point, but the whole component shifts rigidly by the min drop across its columns, preserving relative positions (e.g., multi-column shapes don't rotate or separate).
 * Components can span multiple columns, and drop is limited by the "tightest" column (least space below), which can cause uneven stacking if columns have different obstacles.
 * After dropping one component, the grid updates, so subsequent components see the new state (e.g., they might land on previously dropped ones).
 * No merging or re-connection after drops; components remain as they were.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length), rows are lists of ints (colors 0-9 likely), and output must be a new grid with exact same dimensions.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order is critical—top-down would cause overlaps or incorrect stacking; also, "lowest" is max row index per column for the component.
 * Empty spaces are only background; non-background blocks block drops.
 * Singles and small groups must be treated identically to large ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent number in the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This works well for background detection, as seen in outputs where 5 seems to be background in example 1, but verify per grid.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find connected components of same non-background numbers (4-way adjacent), including singles."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != background:
                num = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == num:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, num))
    return components
```
(This correctly identifies components with positions as (row, col) tuples and color, using DFS/stack for connectivity; essential for rigid unit extraction.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (e.g., 5 in example 1, 2 in example 2) and finds connected components accurately, including singles and multi-block shapes.
 * Sorting components bottom-to-top by max row works in principle to process gravity order.
 * Clearing component before drop and attempting rigid shift by min column drop distance captures the core rigid-body fall idea.
 * Train 1 generated output keeps top rows unchanged (all 5s and some 1s/4s/2s static, which is correct for non-falling parts), but fails to properly drop lower components: e.g., 8s and 9s in rows 7-11 are misplaced or not dropped far enough (generated has 8s scattered in row 9-11 without forming expected clusters like [8,8,8,8] in row 2 of expected), and a 1 in row 7 col 18 is wrong (expected has 8 there); also, row 4 expected has 8s/9s/4s/2s in specific positions, but generated has incorrect 5s/8s/9s scattering—likely due to flawed per-column lowest calc or not updating grid properly for subsequent drops.
 * Train 2 generated output correctly keeps top 2s and bottom 3s static, and stacks some 4s/1s/7s in upper rows, but messes up lower drops: e.g., row 11 expected has 2s/9/2s but generated has all 1s/7s; row 17 expected has 1s but generated has 8s misplaced; row 20 expected has 4/8/9/1s but generated has scattered 8s/9s/4s/2s/3s in wrong spots—drop distance underestimates space in some columns, causing partial overlaps or insufficient fall; also, 3 in row 23 expected but generated has 9/1s there.
 * Overall, drop logic fails: col_lowest uses max i per column (correct for lowest point), but count of backgrounds below starts from lowest+1 and stops at first non-background (correct), yet min(d) across columns leads to too-small drops, as seen in both trains where components don't reach expected stacked positions (e.g., 8-group in train 1 should drop more to row 2-4 area).
 * No rotation or color change, which is correct, but grid copy (new_g) is good to avoid mutating original.
 * Function get_background and find_connected_components are helpful and accurate; main program drop calc is broken (under-drops, possibly miscounts empties after prior clears).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the inf drop init and stack-based DFS are solid—avoid recursive DFS to prevent stack overflow in large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with two full rows of 4s (possibly assuming 4 as background, but input likely has different bg—wait, input not shown, but output has 4s filling top, which shouldn't happen as static parts should remain), then repeats [1,1,7s,2s,7s,3s] blocks identically across rows 2-20 without variation, indicating no drops occurred for most components (rigid 7/2/3 strips didn't fall), and bottom rows 21-30 have chaotic scattering of 1/7/8/9/2/4/3 (e.g., row 29 has mixed 1/4/3/9/9/7/9/9/8/8/7/1/7/2/2/7/7/7/7/9/7/7/2/2/4/3/3, far from any stacked order)—this suggests components weren't cleared/dropped properly, min-drop was 0 for many (no fall), or sorting failed, leading to static copy with minor bottom jumble; expected should have upper static rows, then fallen 7/8/9 groups stacking rigidly from bottom (e.g., 8s/9s dropping into lower rows without overlap, preserving shapes like vertical 7 strips but shifted down by column-min empties).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

- **Maroon shapes and small Light Blue pixels**: Light Blue pixels (1-4 pixels, holes=0) are consistently adjacent to or within the bounding box of Maroon shapes in inputs. In outputs, these Light Blue pixels relocate near the transformed Maroon shapes, indicating an attachment-based interaction that affects positional relocation of the Maroon (e.g., from left/input side to right/output side in train 1; from top to bottom in train 2). Pixel count of attached Light Blue remains conserved (e.g., 2-pixel clusters stay 2 pixels).

- **Maroon shapes and small Red/Dark Red pixels**: Red or Dark Red pixels (1-2 pixels, holes=0) are consistently positioned adjacent to Maroon shapes in inputs, often as protrusions. In outputs, these pixels relocate in proximity to the transformed Maroon, suggesting an attachment that influences the Maroon's positional or minor shape adjustment (bbox dimensions change, but total Maroon pixels conserved at 19 in train 1, 23 in train 2). Consistent across both trains.

- **Maroon shapes and small Yellow pixels**: Yellow pixels (1-3 pixels, holes=0) appear attached or near Maroon shapes in inputs. Outputs show these Yellow pixels repositioned near transformed Maroons, implying an interaction affecting movement direction (rightward in train 1, downward in train 2). Counts conserved (e.g., single pixels remain single).

- **Background panels and hole count**: Central background panels (Orange in train 1, Blue in train 2) consistently have holes reduced in outputs (2 to 1 per panel in train 1; 4 to 2 in train 2), with corresponding pixel increases (+1 per panel in train 1, +3 total in train 2). This suggests an interaction where foreground elements (e.g., Maroon or small pixels) affect background properties, possibly by partial filling or edge interaction. Side panels (Blue/Yellow/Red in train 1; Yellow/Dark Red/Red/Green in train 2) remain unchanged (holes=0, pixels fixed).

- **Position to transformation**: Input positions of Maroon shapes and attachments (left/top relative to dividers) consistently map to output positions on the opposite side (right/bottom), with bbox shifts (e.g., x-increase in train 1, y-increase in train 2). No other position-to-color changes observed consistently.

### Unknowns
- Exact transformation mechanics (e.g., how specific attachment colors dictate shift vector, rotation, or minor pixel adjustments in Maroon bbox) cannot be explained from bbox/pixel data alone; requires grid visualization to confirm connectivity.
- Green elements appear only in train 2 (small attachments and bottom panel); no consistent interaction across both trains, so excluded.
- No consistent hole interactions in foreground shapes (all holes=0); background hole reduction mechanism relative to specific foreground components is unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 23:20:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity on colored cells, where connected groups (blobs) of non-background cells fall downward as rigid units (without rotating or deforming) until they rest on the bottom of the grid or other stable blobs, processed in a specific order to handle interactions correctly. The goal is to apply this gravity step once, preserving colors and connections while treating the background as empty space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) components of any non-background cells, ignoring color differences within the blob—colors stay the same during falls.
 * Background detection: Prefer 0 if present anywhere in the grid; otherwise, use the most frequent color as background (this handles grids without explicit empties).
 * Drop mechanics: Blobs fall rigidly, so the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background cells below the lowest point in each occupied column of the blob—this ensures the entire blob can drop without parts getting stuck unevenly.
 * Processing order: Sort and process blobs from bottom-to-top (by maximum row index, descending) to simulate sequential falling without upper blobs interfering with lower ones prematurely; update the grid after each blob's drop.
 * Clearing and placement: Before dropping a blob, temporarily clear its original positions to background for accurate drop calculation (avoids self-interference), then place the shifted blob; clip placements if they go out of bounds (though grids seem fixed-height).
 * Subtle elements: Falls are per-blob, not per-cell (no individual pixel drops like sand); rigid means no tilting/rotation, so min-drop across columns preserves shape. Multiple passes aren't needed—single application per program call. Blobs might span multiple colors but fall as one if connected. In examples, background isn't always 0 (e.g., possibly 5 in ex1 top rows, or 2 in ex2 top). Watch for floating blobs that should stack precisely without overlapping or merging post-fall. Order matters: bottom-first prevents chain reactions where a falling upper blob lands on a just-fallen lower one incorrectly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Compute drops on a temp grid after clearing the blob itself (prevents overestimating space below). If no background below, drop=0 (already resting). Grids are rectangular, rows from top (index 0) to bottom (higher indices).
 * All considerations: No diagonal connections (strict 4-way). Blobs with no cells below don't move. Post-drop, new connections might form but aren't re-blobbed in one step (single gravity application). Handle empty grids or all-background gracefully (return unchanged).

    return new_g
```

**Unhelpful/broken functions:** The `apply_gravity` function in this attempt is flawed—it processes blobs sequentially on an updating grid but computes drops on a temp-cleared grid, which works conceptually but fails in practice due to incorrect min-drop logic (causes blobs to under-drop or misalign rigidly). Don't reuse as-is; the temp-clear step is good but integration with updates causes ordering issues.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it demonstrates core understanding of blobs, rigid drops, and bottom-up processing but fails both training examples due to incorrect blob placements post-drop.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps top 5-heavy rows static (correct), but the 8/9 blob in mid-rows falls incorrectly—e.g., row 8 has 8's at cols 5-7 but expected has them shifted differently; row 9 has scattered 1's and 8/9's mismatched (generated has 8,9,8 at cols 16-18, expected has 8,8,8 at cols 16-18 but in different rows); row 10 has 8's over-dropped or mispositioned vs expected 8,9 at cols 8-9. Bottom 2's static (correct). Unknown why 4's and some 5's don't interact properly—possibly min-drop too conservative, preventing full rigid fall.
 * Train 2: Generated has top 2's static (correct), mid 4/1/7 rows mostly static but with erroneous 8/9 intrusions in lower rows (e.g., row 17 has 8's at end, not in expected); bottom 3's static (correct). But key mismatch: expected has 2/9/8 blobs falling precisely (e.g., row 11 expected has 2's at cols 16-19, but generated piles 1's/8's wrong); row 18-20 have 8/9/7 scattered vs expected structured 8's and 1's. Over-clearing or wrong order causes chain misplacements.
 * Blob finding and sorting work (identifies components correctly), but drop computation and placement fail to preserve rigid shapes across interactions—e.g., upper blobs don't account for just-fallen lower ones accurately.
 * Temp-clear in apply_gravity is a good idea for isolation but breaks when sequential updates aren't re-blobbing (no re-detection of new connections post-drop).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it shows excessive piling of 7's, 2's, and scattered 8/9/1/3/4 elements toward the bottom/mid, with top rows all 4's (possibly static background?) and uniform stacking (e.g., rows 7-25 mostly 7's in cols 2-13 and 16-24, 2's in cols 14-15), but this ignores rigid shapes: e.g., the complex 7/8/9 blob in input (rows 2-5, cols 2-13) should fall as a unit, preserving its irregular shape (like the 9 at row3 col5), not flattening into solid 7's; the right-side 1/8/9/2/4 elements (cols 20+) are mangled (e.g., row 6 has 8,8 at cols 20-21 but input has 1,7), suggesting over-drop or non-rigid merging. Bottom 3's are static (likely correct), but left 1's and mid 2's are homogenized wrong—expected should have staggered falls (e.g., left 1's drop less than mid 7's due to supports), not this blocky stack. Doesn't match training patterns where shapes preserve (e.g., ex1's 8/9 clusters stay clustered).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Rule: Copy the input grid unchanged, as a baseline transformation."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return copy_grid(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:27:23] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid transformation puzzle where an input grid of numbers (likely representing colors, labels, or connected components in a visual pattern) is modified according to specific rules to produce an output grid. The rules seem to involve altering certain regions or "objects" (connected groups of similar numbers) by filling, propagating, or reshaping them based on patterns observed in the training examples, such as expanding/shrinking blobs, inserting barriers, or mirroring structures, while preserving overall structure like borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 26 elements wide (likely 13x2 or similar 2D representation flattened per row) and variable height (13 rows in example 1, 25 in example 2), with numbers from 1-9 representing distinct elements (e.g., 5 as background/filler, 1/2/4 as borders or objects, 7/8/9 as variable shapes).
 * Changes are not uniform; some rows remain unchanged (e.g., top/bottom borders in example 1 stay [1,1,5s,4,4,5s,2,2]), while middle rows show targeted modifications like inserting 8/9 clusters or replacing 5s with 2/8/4 patterns, suggesting rules for detecting and transforming "objects" (connected same-number regions).
 * Subtle elements: Transformations may propagate vertically/horizontally (e.g., in example 1 row 3, 8s appear in positions 18-21 and 22 becomes 2, shifting from input's all-5s); example 2 shows more complex shifts like 8/9 insertions in lower rows and 3/4 borders affecting propagation. Easy to miss: Not all identical regions change (e.g., many 1-filled rows stay static until specific triggers like nearby 8/9); possible asymmetry (changes don't mirror perfectly left-right); bottom rows often unchanged except borders.
 * Key considerations: Rules likely involve identifying "shapes" or "events" (e.g., 8/9 as anomalies that trigger fills with 2/4/7); no global copy—only specific rows/columns alter; test input has denser 7/8/9 patterns, suggesting rules must handle overlapping objects without overwriting borders (1/2/3/4). Across attempts (only one so far), baseline copying ignores all transformations, missing object detection entirely. Potential for iterative passes (e.g., fill then boundary-check) to avoid over-propagation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Rule: Copy the input grid unchanged, as a baseline transformation."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is a basic utility for unchanged output but not helpful for actual transformations; it preserves input exactly, which fails all cases.)

No other functions from attempts; future attempts may need object extraction (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of 5/7/8/9) or pattern matching (e.g., detect 8-clusters and replace with 2/4 fills).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used only a copy_grid function, which produced identical input/output for all cases—resulting in INCORRECT for both training examples.
 * Training example 1: Generated matches input exactly (e.g., rows 3-5 have uniform 5s and misplaced 4/8/9 where expected has structured 8/2/9 insertions like row 3: positions 18-21 as 8s and 22 as 2); differences are widespread (e.g., expected row 4 has 8/9/5/8/5/5/5 vs generated's scattered 5/8/9/1); unknown why copy fails but clearly no transformation applied.
 * Training example 2: Generated again copies input (e.g., rows 3-11 have 1s and early 8/9 insertions where expected simplifies many to uniform 1s until row 12's 2/9/2, then 4/8 clusters); differences include over-retaining input's 8/9/2 in rows 4-6/11-14 (expected clears to 1s or shifts 8s lower) and mismatched bottom 4/8/7/3 patterns (e.g., expected row 18 has 4/8/8/7 vs generated's extra 9/1); copy ignores simplification rules.
 * No object extraction attempted, which seems essential for identifying changeable regions (e.g., 5/1/7 blobs); copy_grid is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle as it applies no rules (avoid in future).
 * Overall, attempt shows zero understanding of transformation rules, treating puzzle as identity function.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is just a direct copy of the (presumed) test input, with no modifications—e.g., rows 3-30 retain input's 7/8/9/4/2/1/3 patterns exactly (like row 5: 1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,... vs no simplification to expected uniform 7s or 8-fills).
 * This does not look correct; training examples show targeted changes (e.g., clearing 5/1 to structures with 8/2/9 or simplifying 1/8 to uniform fills), but test output ignores similar 7/8/9 clusters (e.g., row 4's 8/8/7/8/8 should likely propagate or reshape based on rules, not copy; row 7's 3/7/3/3 insertions suggest unhandled border/object interactions). It misses any pattern logic, making it invalid—future programs must detect and alter these without preserving input noise.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 23:27:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:40:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulations where input grids have framed content areas with a background color and scattered "disturbed" (anomalous) rows forming shapes or objects. The goal is to detect frames, identify and group consecutive disturbed rows, reverse the order within each group (to "correct" or unscramble them), optionally adjust/shift elements within rows, and reposition these reversed groups to the bottom of the content area with clean background rows filling the top and single-row gaps separating groups, while preserving the overall grid structure including frames.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have uniform top/bottom frame rows (often 1-2 rows of a single color like 1's or 4's) and left/right borders (often 2 columns wide, e.g., 1's or 4's), which must be preserved; content area starts after top frame and ends before bottom frame.
 * Background color (bg) is the most common value in the content area (e.g., 5 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in test); disturbed rows are those differing from a "standard" clean row (bg-filled content with borders intact) in the content area only—borders and frames should not be considered disturbed.
 * Anomalies form vertical groups of consecutive disturbed rows representing shapes; these must be collected as intact groups without splitting, then reversed internally (row order flipped, but columns unchanged unless shifting is needed).
 * Reversed groups are placed starting from the bottom of the content area upward, with exactly one clean (bg) row as a gap between groups; remaining space above is filled with clean rows to maintain content height.
 * Subtle: No horizontal shifting or per-group adjustments unless explicitly needed to align shapes (current attempts overdo this, causing mismatches); shapes may have internal variations (e.g., 8/9 as parts of 8-shapes) that must stay intact during reversal.
 * Bottom frame must be re-added if content expansion requires it; total height must match input.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-clean content (return unchanged); multiple small groups vs. one large; anomalies touching borders (ignore border columns for disturbance check); sampling bg from initial content rows only to avoid bias from anomalies.
 * Across attempts: Over-reliance on fixed left/right widths (2) works for samples but may fail if variable; reversal is within-group only, not global; placement must calculate top clean rows precisely as content_h - total_disturbed_rows - (num_groups - 1).

        if idx < num_groups - 1:
            result.append(standard[:])
```

The following function is unhelpful/broken: `shift_shape_right`—it applies arbitrary horizontal shifts (e.g., by 1 or 2) to "anomaly parts," but this distorts shapes incorrectly (e.g., moves 8/9 pixels without preserving object integrity) and isn't needed for core reversal/placement; it causes mismatches in all samples by scattering elements instead of keeping groups intact. Avoid in future; shapes may not need shifting, or it should be rule-based (e.g., align to left of content).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt partially understands frame detection, bg identification, and disturbed group collection/reversal, but fails on placement (groups not positioned correctly at bottom with proper gaps, leading to scattered or top-placed anomalies) and adds unnecessary shifts that break shape coherence.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps some top-frame 1's and partial 4's/5's but places reversed groups too high/mixed with originals (e.g., row 3 has 8,9,9 instead of expected 8,8,8,8,2; row 4 has 8,8,8,8,5,8,5 vs. expected 4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2); bottom clean rows are all 5's but lack the expected consolidated 4,4 borders and shape rearrangements (e.g., no 1,8,8,9 in row 6); overall, reversal happens but shifts distort (e.g., 8's moved right incorrectly), and groups aren't gapped/placed low enough—13 rows output but shapes overlap top content.
 * Train 2: Generated fills top with clean 2's (correct frame?) but then dumps all content as uniform 1's for many rows (ignores disturbances), places a single messed-up group low (e.g., row 12 has 2,9,2 vs. expected 1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1; row 13 has 4,8,8,9,8,1,8,1 vs. expected 1,1,4,8,8,9,8,8,1,1), and adds bottom 3's frame incorrectly early; misses multiple groups (e.g., separate 8/9 clusters not reversed separately), over-applies bg=1 washing out shapes, and placement ignores gaps (groups concatenated without separation); bottom has extra mismatched rows like row 18 with 8,8,8,1,1,8,3,1 vs. expected consolidated lower shapes.
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better group extraction (current reverse_disturbed_groups is helpful but misses multi-group separation in train 2).
 * Over-assumes fixed shifts per group (e.g., idx==0 shift=1) causes unknown distortions (e.g., why 9's move left in train 1 row 3?); no handling for variable frame widths.
 * Function `shift_shape_right` is broken/unhelpful (distorts without rules, e.g., fills with bg incorrectly, moves only if next is bg—leads to partial shifts like in test row 20).
 * Core reversal/placement logic is on track but execution fails due to bad integration (e.g., result builds from top frame but appends without clearing original content).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it preserves top 4-frames well but treats much of the content as disturbed incorrectly (e.g., rows 3-11 show uniform 7's with 2's in positions 15,17—likely failed to group 2's/9's as separate small anomalies, instead scattering them via shifts), leading to non-coherent shapes (e.g., row 20 has isolated 2,7,2,7,2 vs. expected consolidated group like a reversed 2/8-pattern at bottom; row 22 has 7,8,7,8,7,8 vs. expected intact reversed block). Placement is wrong—no clear bottom-grouping with gaps (anomalies like 9's in row 12-14 and 8's in 20-26 are mid-grid and fragmented, not reversed/lowered as a unit); bg=7 is detected but clean fills are missing (e.g., no top clean 7's before groups). This suggests over-shifting broke groups (e.g., 9's in row 6 moved down but not grouped), and no proper gap calculation (excess rows stay disturbed). To handle test, need stricter group collection (treat sparse 2/9 as one group?) and disable shifts; expected likely has 2/8/9 shapes reversed and stacked at bottom with 7-cleans above and 3-frame below.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 23:40:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid transformation puzzle where an input grid of numbers (likely representing colors, labels, or connected components in a visual pattern) is modified according to specific rules to produce an output grid. The rules seem to involve altering certain regions or "objects" (connected groups of similar numbers) by filling, propagating, or reshaping them based on patterns observed in the training examples, such as expanding/shrinking blobs, inserting barriers, or mirroring structures, while preserving overall structure like borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 26 elements wide (likely 13x2 or similar 2D representation flattened per row) and variable height (13 rows in example 1, 25 in example 2), with numbers from 1-9 representing distinct elements (e.g., 5 as background/filler, 1/2/4 as borders or objects, 7/8/9 as variable shapes).
 * Changes are not uniform; some rows remain unchanged (e.g., top/bottom borders in example 1 stay [1,1,5s,4,4,5s,2,2]), while middle rows show targeted modifications like inserting 8/9 clusters or replacing 5s with 2/8/4 patterns, suggesting rules for detecting and transforming "objects" (connected same-number regions).
 * Subtle elements: Transformations may propagate vertically/horizontally (e.g., in example 1 row 3, 8s appear in positions 18-21 and 22 becomes 2, shifting from input's all-5s); example 2 shows more complex shifts like 8/9 insertions in lower rows and 3/4 borders affecting propagation. Easy to miss: Not all identical regions change (e.g., many 1-filled rows stay static until specific triggers like nearby 8/9); possible asymmetry (changes don't mirror perfectly left-right); bottom rows often unchanged except borders.
 * Key considerations: Rules likely involve identifying "shapes" or "events" (e.g., 8/9 as anomalies that trigger fills with 2/4/7); no global copy—only specific rows/columns alter; test input has denser 7/8/9 patterns, suggesting rules must handle overlapping objects without overwriting borders (1/2/3/4). Across attempts (only one so far), baseline copying ignores all transformations, missing object detection entirely. Potential for iterative passes (e.g., fill then boundary-check) to avoid over-propagation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Rule: Copy the input grid unchanged, as a baseline transformation."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is a basic utility for unchanged output but not helpful for actual transformations; it preserves input exactly, which fails all cases.)

No other functions from attempts; future attempts may need object extraction (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of 5/7/8/9) or pattern matching (e.g., detect 8-clusters and replace with 2/4 fills).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used only a copy_grid function, which produced identical input/output for all cases—resulting in INCORRECT for both training examples.
 * Training example 1: Generated matches input exactly (e.g., rows 3-5 have uniform 5s and misplaced 4/8/9 where expected has structured 8/2/9 insertions like row 3: positions 18-21 as 8s and 22 as 2); differences are widespread (e.g., expected row 4 has 8/9/5/8/5/5/5 vs generated's scattered 5/8/9/1); unknown why copy fails but clearly no transformation applied.
 * Training example 2: Generated again copies input (e.g., rows 3-11 have 1s and early 8/9 insertions where expected simplifies many to uniform 1s until row 12's 2/9/2, then 4/8 clusters); differences include over-retaining input's 8/9/2 in rows 4-6/11-14 (expected clears to 1s or shifts 8s lower) and mismatched bottom 4/8/7/3 patterns (e.g., expected row 18 has 4/8/8/7 vs generated's extra 9/1); copy ignores simplification rules.
 * No object extraction attempted, which seems essential for identifying changeable regions (e.g., 5/1/7 blobs); copy_grid is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle as it applies no rules (avoid in future).
 * Overall, attempt shows zero understanding of transformation rules, treating puzzle as identity function.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is just a direct copy of the (presumed) test input, with no modifications—e.g., rows 3-30 retain input's 7/8/9/4/2/1/3 patterns exactly (like row 5: 1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,... vs no simplification to expected uniform 7s or 8-fills).
 * This does not look correct; training examples show targeted changes (e.g., clearing 5/1 to structures with 8/2/9 or simplifying 1/8 to uniform fills), but test output ignores similar 7/8/9 clusters (e.g., row 4's 8/8/7/8/8 should likely propagate or reshape based on rules, not copy; row 7's 3/7/3/3 insertions suggest unhandled border/object interactions). It misses any pattern logic, making it invalid—future programs must detect and alter these without preserving input noise.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a falling blocks or gravity-based puzzle (similar to games like Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Puyo Puyo) where numbered blocks (representing colors or types) fall downward under gravity within a grid, but with rules that likely involve connected groups of the same number falling as units, potential matching/removal of adjacent same-number blocks, and rebuilding the grid after falls. The goal is to simulate one step of falling and settling, resulting in a new grid configuration.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks fall downward (toward higher row indices, assuming row 0 is top) but only until they hit another block or the bottom; independent per-cell falling doesn't work, as seen in mismatches where groups shift together.
 * Connected components of the same number likely fall as rigid units if adjacent (horizontally or vertically), preserving their shape during descent, rather than per-column independent movement—this explains why simple column gravity scrambles group positions in expected outputs.
 * No explicit empty cells (0s) are visible in inputs/outputs; all cells seem filled with numbers (1-9), so "empty" might be implicit or handled differently (e.g., gaps created by falling but not shown, or the grid is always dense).
 * Matching rules may apply: adjacent (3+ in a row/column) same numbers might disappear before or after falling, creating space for further drops, but this isn't simulated in the attempt—subtle because outputs show rearranged but not removed blocks.
 * Grid is represented as List[List[int]] with rows as outer lists; falling affects vertical positions but may involve horizontal stability for connected blobs.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s in train 1/2) seem fixed or "floor" layers that don't move, suggesting gravity only applies above certain stable bases.
 * Subtle: Rotations, merges, or color-specific behaviors (e.g., 5s as background?) might occur, but easy to miss without full rules; outputs show specific repositions like 8s/9s clustering differently.
 * All attempts must preserve grid dimensions and number distributions—no creation/destruction except possibly via matches.
 * Consider iterative falling: blocks may need multiple passes until stable, as single-pass column gravity leaves floating groups in generated vs. expected.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple per-column gravity, which worked for basic downward movement in isolated columns (e.g., stacking non-empties at bottom) but failed to handle connected groups across columns, leading to scrambled positions.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps many 5s static and drops 8s/9s/2s/1s/4s incorrectly per column (e.g., row 3 has 9 in col 18 generated vs. expected 8s cluster in cols 17-20; row 5 has 8s/9s/4/2 misplaced vs. expected 8s/9s/2s in specific blob shapes); unknown why blobs don't preserve shape, but likely because no component detection.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated drops 8s/9s/2s/4s/3s per column, creating floating or misaligned groups (e.g., row 11 has 8s/9s scattered vs. expected clustered 2s/9s in cols 17-20 and 8s below; row 18 has 9 in col 6 generated vs. expected 8s/7s cluster; bottom 3s intact but upper layers wrong); simple gravity ignores horizontal connections.
 * extract_columns and build_grid are helpful for column-wise ops but broken for this puzzle as they enable only independent falls, not group-aware simulation (still useful as building blocks).
 * apply_gravity is unhelpful/broken: Assumes empty=0 (but no 0s in grids), moves all non-empties to bottom per column without checking connections or stability, causing over-dropping and loss of structure (don't use in future without mods for groups).
 * No detection of matches/removals, missing potential disappearances that create fall space.
 * Core issue: Treats grid as independent columns instead of holistic structure with blobs; this partially understands vertical falling (some bottom stacking matches) but misses horizontal adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies simplistic per-column stacking (e.g., all 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s/2s/1s dropped to bottoms of their columns, creating dense lower layers with floating mismatches like isolated 9s/8s in upper rows), but ignores connected groups—e.g., clusters of 8s/9s in cols 4-6 and 20-23 should likely fall as units preserving shapes, not scatter vertically per column (generated has 8s split across rows 3-11 in col 4 vs. expected probable tight drop to row 5-7 or similar). This results in unnatural fragmentation (e.g., row 6 has scattered 3/8/7 vs. expected consolidated blobs) and doesn't account for potential matches (e.g., multiple adjacent 7s might clear). Without expected, it visually resembles over-simplified Tetris drops but fails training logic, so likely wrong; needs group detection to handle test's complex 7/8/9 clusters.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformations on colored grids (likely representing images or patterns with numbers as colors), where rules govern pixel changes, shape movements, or mergers, often involving special values like 9 (possibly holes or temporary markers) interacting with backgrounds and other shapes. The goal is to apply consistent rules across examples to produce expected outputs, such as relocating or erasing elements while preserving borders and overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color, but transformations must preserve static borders (e.g., 1's, 4's) and not alter unrelated areas.
 * 9's appear to represent temporary or "hole" pixels that can be transferred, merged, or removed based on context: non-isolated 9's (adjacent to non-background) seem to blend into background or shapes, but isolated 9's may persist or move.
 * Shape movements or expansions: In training 1 expected, 8's expand or shift (e.g., row 2 has 8's where generated has 5's; row 3 has a 2 intrusion), suggesting rules for object propagation or filling holes rather than simple erasure.
 * Hole reduction: Comment in code mentions "hole reduction," but expected outputs show 9's relocating (e.g., training 1 row 3 has 9 in expected but not generated; training 2 has 9's in specific positions like row 11 col 19).
 * Subtle element: Connectivity matters—diagonal or full 8-directional adjacency might be needed for "isolation," as 4-directional (used in code) misses some interactions (e.g., training 2 generated keeps some 8's/9's isolated incorrectly).
 * Color-specific rules: 9's interact with specific shapes (e.g., 8's in training 1, 2's/8's in training 2), not just background; over-generalizing to all non-bg neighbors fails when shapes like 2 or 3 intrude.
 * Grid consistency: Outputs must match exact positions; small mismatches (e.g., a single 5 vs. 8) indicate rule gaps, like failing to handle multi-step transfers or conditional movements based on neighboring shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Preserve "divider" or border elements (e.g., 4's in training 2 rows 2-23); don't flood entire areas; account for vertical/horizontal asymmetries in shapes.
 * All attempts so far focus on 9-to-bg transfer, but ignore shape relocation (e.g., 8's moving right/down in expected vs. static in generated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, used in both trainings and test; essential for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def is_isolated(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Note: May need 8 directions for full connectivity
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            if g[nr][nc] != bg:
                return False
    return True
```
(This checks 4-directional isolation of 9's from non-background; helpful but limited—subtleties like diagonal connections may require expansion; used to avoid changing isolated 9's, which persists some correctly but misses mergers.)

                out[r][c] = bg
    return out
```
(This applies the core transfer logic; partially helpful for non-isolated 9's but broken for cases needing movement instead of erasure, as seen in trainings.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on erasing non-isolated 9's to background, which worked partially for reducing some "small shapes" but failed to relocate or expand other elements (e.g., 8's static in generated vs. shifted in expected).
 * Training 1: Generated erased some 9's correctly (e.g., row 6 col 9 stays 9 as isolated?), but mismatched by keeping 5's where expected has 8's/2's (e.g., row 2 all 5's vs. expected 8's in row 2; row 3 has 9 at col 18 in generated but expected has 8's and 9 elsewhere; unknown why 8-shapes didn't propagate).
 * Training 1: Missed hole filling or shape intrusion (e.g., expected row 4 has 9 at col 18, but generated has it at col 18 unchanged? Wait, generated row 3 col 18 is 9, but expected row 3 has 8's/2; differences in 8-blob positions and a 4/9 mismatch in row 4).
 * Training 2: Generated erased some 9's (e.g., row 18 col 6 becomes 1? but expected has 8's moving), but kept invalid 8's/2's (e.g., row 5 has 8's where expected has all 1's; row 11 has 2's/9 where expected relocates them; row 17 has 8's in generated vs. expected 1's with 8's lower).
 * Training 2: Failed to collapse or move shapes upward/downward (e.g., expected simplifies upper rows to 1's, but generated retains scattered 8's/2's; unknown reason for not detecting multi-pixel "small shapes").
 * Overall: No training passed; attempt demonstrates partial understanding of 9's as transferable but ignores broader rules like shape adjacency mergers or position-specific changes; is_isolated is helpful but too narrow (4-dir vs. 8-dir?).
 * No object extraction attempted yet, but would be essential for identifying "small shapes" beyond single 9's (e.g., connected components of 8's/9's).
 * transfer_pixels is partially helpful for bg blending but not for the puzzle's apparent "movement" or "filling" mechanics; don't rely solely on it without shape detection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies the same 9-to-bg erasure as trainings, changing scattered 9's (e.g., row 19 col 8 to 7?, row 20 col 20 to 7?, row 25 col 4 to 7?, row 26 col 5 to 7?) but leaves shapes like 8's and 3's intact without apparent movement or expansion.
 * Unlike trainings, test has more 9's in lower rows (e.g., rows 25-29), but output erases non-isolated ones without addressing potential shape interactions (e.g., 8's in row 3 col 4-5 stay, but if rules involve propagation like in training 1 expected, they should shift).
 * Output mismatches likely expected by over-simplifying: e.g., row 6 has 1/4/8's unchanged, but puzzles may require filling holes with adjacent colors (7's?); background seems 7 (common), but 4's/1's/2's/3's persist without merger, suggesting incomplete rules.
 * No sense of "correctness" without expected, but based on training failures, this likely errs by not handling 8/9 clusters as movable objects (e.g., the 8-blob in rows 3-5 cols 4-8 may need to expand rightward like training 1's 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to simulate a block-dropping game on a grid where numbers represent colored blocks, with upward gravity (blocks move toward the top of the grid, i.e., lower row indices), removal of connected groups of three or more 9s, and a second application of gravity after removal to settle the grid. The goal is to process an input grid through these mechanics to produce a stable final state, preserving non-9 blocks and handling connectivity correctly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent number in the grid, used to identify empty space for gravity drops.
 * Connected components are defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) of the same non-background number; single blocks are treated as components of size 1.
 * Gravity is upward (delta=-1, moving to lower row indices), and entire components drop as rigid units; the drop distance for a component is the minimum clear space above any of its blocks in the same column.
 * Components must be processed in a specific order during gravity: sort by descending max row (process "lower" components first), then descending min row, to avoid interference from higher-dropping components.
 * Removal targets only connected groups of 9s with size >=3; smaller 9 groups or singles stay, and removal sets them to background without triggering chain reactions beyond the second gravity pass.
 * After first gravity, remove 9 groups, then apply gravity again; no further removals or iterations.
 * Grid is rectangular; assume consistent row lengths, but handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Subtle: When clearing a component for drop calculation, the grid temporarily has holes, but drops are per-column and min across the component; if min_d=0, restore without moving.
 * Subtle: Gravity loop continues until no movement, but in practice, one pass per phase may suffice if stable.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order prevents components from blocking each other incorrectly; without it, drops can overlap or skip.
 * Easy to miss: 9 removal happens only once, post-first gravity, and only on connected 9s >=3; other numbers never remove.
 * Consideration: Outputs are flattened rows (lists of ints), but grids are 2D; preserve structure but print as 1D per row.
 * Consideration: In example 2, many 1s consolidate but some structures like 8s and 2s partially survive or reposition differently, suggesting complex interactions.

    return min_d
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies background via frequency and uses 4-way connected components, which is essential for grouping.
 * Gravity implementation moves components as units with min drop distance, which works for basic settling but fails in ordering: sorting by (-max_i, -min_i) processes "lower" first, but in training example 1, it leads to incorrect repositioning of 8s and 5s (e.g., generated has stacked 8s in row 2-3 that don't match expected scattered 8s and 2s integration).
 * In training example 1, post-removal gravity doesn't properly handle surviving 9s or 1s; generated ends with uniform 5s in many rows, but expected has varied placements like 8s in row 3 cols 17-20, a 2 in row 3 col 21, and specific 4/8/9 mixes in row 4—differences suggest over-dropping or incorrect clearing/restoration when min_d=0.
 * In training example 2, initial gravity consolidates 1s and 8s too aggressively upward, creating uniform 1 rows (e.g., generated rows 8-11 all 1s in many cols), but expected keeps more structure like isolated 2/9/8 groups lower (e.g., expected row 12 has 2s and 9, row 13 has 4/8/9/8)—this indicates the component processing order or drop calculation ignores inter-component collisions after clearing.
 * 9 removal works (groups >=3 cleared), but in example 2, generated removes some 8s/9s incorrectly or fails second gravity, leading to leftover 9s in row 6 and uniform bottoms, unlike expected where 8s form lines in rows 13-14/18-21 but 9s are isolated or removed selectively.
 * The apply_gravity loop with while True and moved flag is helpful for stability, but in practice, it over-applies in examples, homogenizing grids (e.g., all 2s at top in example 2 generated, but expected has 2s integrated lower).
 * remove_large_nines_groups is correct and relevant, as it targets only 9s >=3 connected.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are core, but compute_drop_distance may undercount if grid changes mid-drop (though it clears first, so potentially okay—issue likely in sequencing).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive stacking of 7s in nearly all middle rows (rows 3-30+ mostly 7s with some 2s/3s/9s sprinkled), and uniform 4s at the very top, which homogenizes the input's mixed 1/7/8/9/3/2/4 distribution unrealistically.
 * Input has diverse clusters (e.g., 7s scattered, 8s in groups, 3s at right bottom, 2s in cols 15-16), but output treats most non-4/3 as 7s dropping fully upward, ignoring distinct component identities—e.g., 8s and 9s should form separate groups post-gravity/removal, not merge into 7 stacks.
 * No 9 removal evident (input has potential 9 groups, like row 3 col7/ row4 col6, but output has stray 9s without clearing >=3), and second gravity seems to collapse everything without preserving shapes, unlike training expects where structures like 8-lines or 2-clusters survive in specific positions.
 * Bottom 3s are preserved but isolated; overall, output lacks the expected partial consolidation (e.g., 7s should cluster but not dominate all space, per training patterns), suggesting the program fails on larger/mixed grids by over-simplifying drops.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a gravity-based puzzle where the grid represents a 2D board (likely rows from top to bottom, with row 0 at the top), and non-background cells form connected "blobs" (4-directional connectivity of same or different numbers?) that fall downward independently after being cleared, stacking on top of existing structures or the bottom, simulating physics like in a match-3 or falling blocks game. The goal is to process blobs from bottom to top (highest row first) to apply gravity correctly without interference from lower blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common value in the grid, but in complex grids, ties or non-zero backgrounds might need handling (though not seen here).
 * Blobs are connected components of any non-background cells (not necessarily same number), using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal doesn't count, which is standard but easy to miss if 8-directional is assumed.
 * Blobs must be processed in order from lowest (highest row index, assuming row 0 is top) to highest to avoid upper blobs falling through cleared lower spaces incorrectly.
 * When computing drop distance for a blob, identify all columns it occupies, find the max row (lowest position) in that blob per column, then count consecutive background cells below it in the updated grid (after clearing previous blobs); take the MINIMUM drop across those columns to ensure the blob falls as a rigid unit without splitting.
 * After clearing a blob (set to background), drop it by the computed distance and place it in the new positions, but only if the new row < height; overhanging parts might be lost, but not seen in examples.
 * Subtlety: Dropping happens sequentially on a copy of the grid, so changes from lower blobs affect upper ones' drop calculations—processing bottom-up is crucial to simulate realistic gravity.
 * Blobs might overlap in columns after dropping, causing stacking; the min-drop ensures cohesion.
 * Grid is ragged in output (flattened rows), but input is 2D list; preserve width.
 * Easy to miss: Numbers within a blob can differ (e.g., 8,9 in same blob), so connectivity is by position, not value—blobs are groups of any non-background.
 * After all drops, unchanged top rows (all background) should remain as-is.
 * Potential edge: Empty grid or all background returns unchanged; single-cell blobs drop fully if possible.
 * In examples, some blobs seem to split or not connect properly, suggesting blob finding might over/under-connect based on value equality (but code doesn't require same value, which is good).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This correctly identifies background as mode; useful and bug-free.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    height = len(g)
    width = len(g[0]) if height > 0 else 0
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-dir, no diagonals
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != background:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j, g[i][j])]  # DFS stack for blob traversal
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y, num = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y, num))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != background:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny, g[nx][ny]))
                if blob:
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```
(This DFS-based blob finder is helpful for extracting connected non-background groups; stores position and value, which is key for later placement. It's correct in principle but may fail if blobs need same-value connectivity—examples suggest not.)

```python
def sort_blobs(blobs: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    def get_max_row(blob: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int:
        return max(i for i, _, _ in blob)
    return sorted(blobs, key=get_max_row, reverse=True)
```
(This sorts by lowest point of blob, processing bottom-up; essential for sequential gravity.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background and finds blobs via DFS, which works for connectivity, but fails to apply gravity properly in both training examples—blobs are cleared and dropped, but resulting positions don't match expected falling patterns (e.g., in Train 1, upper 8/9 blobs don't drop into cleared spaces correctly, leaving gaps or misplaced cells).
 * In Train 1, generated output keeps most top rows unchanged but mangles lower blobs (e.g., row 7 has a single 4 misplaced, row 8 has scattered 8/1/5 instead of consolidated drop); expected shows specific 8/9 groups dropping and reshaping, suggesting drop calculation ignores updated grid state or min-distance is wrong (unknown why, but drop_d seems too small or columns misidentified).
 * In Train 2, generated has excessive unchanged rows and blobs like 8/9 not dropping fully (e.g., row 16 has partial 8's, row 17 has fragmented 8/7/1); expected consolidates 8/9/2 into lower positions with proper stacking, indicating the sequential clearing/placing doesn't propagate space correctly—upper blobs fall as if lower ones weren't cleared.
 * compute_drop_distance finds min drop over blob columns based on max_i per col, which is good for rigid drop, but in practice overestimates obstacles (uses new_g after prior clears, but examples show it doesn't "see" the cleared space below).
 * place_blob only places if new_i < height, which is safe, but may clip blobs (not an issue here); however, it doesn't handle if drop causes overlap with uncleared lower blobs.
 * apply_gravity processes sorted_blobs but applies to a copy (new_g), which is correct, yet outputs show blobs not stacking—perhaps sorting reverse=True (bottom-first) is right, but drop calc assumes static below, missing chain reactions.
 * Overall, blob finding seems functional (captures groups like 8/9), but gravity simulation is broken: drops are minimal or zero for many, leading to near-identical grids; unhelpful if connectivity required same values (but code doesn't, and examples have mixed).
 * No unhelpful functions standout, but the full program integrates them poorly—e.g., no validation that blobs don't overlap post-drop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows many repetitive rows of [1,1,7,7,... ,2,2,7,7,... ,3,3] from row 2 onward, with scattered changes in lower rows (e.g., row 3 has 8/9 inserted oddly, row 6 has 3/4 misplaced, row 29 has 9/8/1 at end), but top rows are all 4's unchanged, suggesting minimal dropping happened.
 * Expected should simulate full gravity: identify blobs (e.g., 7's, 8/9 groups, 2's, 3's), clear bottom ones first (like lower 8/9/2), drop them to bottom (possibly stacking on 3's or filling to row ~29), then upper blobs (like top 7's) drop into those spaces; generated has no such consolidation—7's barely move, 8/9 fragments stay high, 2's static, indicating drop_distance computes 0 or 1 for most, ignoring cleared paths.
 * Differences: Generated keeps structure almost intact (e.g., row 12 has 2's in place, but expected would shift everything down); lower rows have artifacts like isolated 9/8 in row 29, unlike expected rigid blob falls; overall, it looks like partial/incomplete simulation, not matching physics where blobs should cascade down fully.
 * To handle test, need to ensure drop calc scans the entire column below max_i for background runs in the progressively updated grid; current min(ds) per blob is right in theory but fails in practice (perhaps bug in cols=set(j for _,j,_ in blob) missing multi-col spans, or while loop in compute_drop_distance stops prematurely).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal appears to be cleaning up or reconstructing a scene by identifying a dominant color (likely the background or main element), filling small non-dominant components within its bounding box, and repositioning specific elements like maroon (color 8) toward a central area, while preserving key structures like borders, objects, and anomalies (e.g., 9s as special markers). The process aims to match expected "clean" or "corrected" grids that maintain object shapes, positions, and details without over-filling or mis-shifting elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Dominant color (e.g., 5 in Train 1, 1 or 4 in Train 2, 7 in test) must be accurately identified as the most common non-background color, but not over-applied to erase important small features like isolated 9s, thin borders (e.g., color 4 lines), or object details.
 * Bounding box should tightly enclose the dominant color's main area to avoid processing irrelevant parts of the grid, but must handle irregular shapes without excluding connected components.
 * Small components (< threshold, e.g., 10 cells) of non-dominant colors inside the bbox should be filled with dominant color only if they are noise/holes; do not fill structural elements like borders (4), object protrusions (e.g., 8 clusters), or anomalies (9s, which seem to represent eyes or special points that must remain).
 * Maroon (8) elements represent objects (e.g., perhaps a character or shape) that need repositioning toward the grid's center, but the shift must be precise (not a fixed 5-column right shift, as it overwrites and misplaces them); consider vertical/horizontal centering based on bbox or grid midpoint, and avoid clearing originals to background (0) if they overlap other elements.
 * Preserve borders and frames (e.g., 1s on sides, 4s as dividers) without alteration, as they define the puzzle structure; top/bottom rows (e.g., all 2s or 3s) are often uniform backgrounds that should not be touched.
 * Anomalies like 9s are rare and must stay in place as they likely indicate key features (e.g., eyes in a face); 0s are empty/neutral spaces to fill selectively, but not all (e.g., larger gaps might be intentional).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 13x26 in Train 1, 26x26 in Train 2, 30x28 in test), so functions must handle rectangular inputs dynamically; connected components should use 4-directional adjacency, but only within bbox to avoid global flooding.
 * Subtle elements: In Train 1, expected output repositions 8s into a more central blob with 9s intact, without filling internal 0s prematurely; in Train 2, small 8/9 clusters and 2s must form specific patterns (e.g., a face or symbol) without being erased. Over-shifting 8s can collide with other colors, creating mismatches.
 * Threshold for "small" components needs tuning (10 may be too low, missing medium noise); do not fill if component touches bbox edges, as it might be a border extension.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes object recognition (e.g., extracting blobs of 8s as movable entities) over blind filling, with rules favoring preservation of visual motifs like symmetry or alignment.

```
(This correctly identifies the most frequent color, useful for background/main element; works in all examples as 5, 1/4-ish, 7.)

```python
def get_bounding_box(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:

    cols = len(g[0])
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = rows, -1, cols, -1
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == color:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)

                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This computes a tight bbox for the dominant color, essential for local processing; accurate but needs to handle empty bbox gracefully.)

```python
def fill_small_components(g: List[List[int]], dominant: int, bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], threshold: int = 10) -> List[List[int]]:
    out = [row[:] for row in g]

    if max_r < min_r:
        return out

                component = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited.add((r, c))
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
                        if (min_r <= nr <= max_r and min_c <= nc <= max_c and
                            0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited and g[nr][nc] != dominant):
                            visited.add((nr, nc))
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if len(component) < threshold:
                    for pr, pc in component:
                        out[pr][pc] = dominant
    return out
```
(This performs DFS-based connected component filling within bbox, helpful for noise removal; works partially but over-fills non-noise like 9s or small 8 parts; threshold=10 is a starting point but needs exceptions for special colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies dominant color and bbox in all cases, and fills some small 0/9 holes appropriately (e.g., scattered 0s in Train 1 rows 4-7 become 5s in generated, matching expected in parts).
 * Fill_small_components works for tiny noise (e.g., isolated 0s in Train 2) but fails on medium components or specials: in Train 1, it incorrectly fills some 8-adjacent 0s and leaves 9s unfilled when they should stay; in Train 2, it erases small 2/9 clusters (e.g., row 11 generated has no 2s where expected has them) and over-fills 8s prematurely.
 * move_maroon_toward_center is broken/unhelpful: fixed 5-column right shift misplaces 8s entirely (e.g., Train 1 generated shifts 8s in rows 4-10 rightward into 5s/0s, creating smears not in expected; Train 2 scatters 8s into borders, losing shape); it clears originals to 0, which introduces new holes, and ignores vertical centering or collision detection.
 * Overall, attempt understands component-based cleaning but misses subtlety of preserving object integrity (8s as movable blobs, 9s as fixed points) and precise repositioning; Train 1 generated mismatches expected in 8/9 placements (e.g., expected row 2 has 8s at cols 17-20, generated has them elsewhere; unknown why 8s aren't clustered centrally) and row 8 has extra 1s/0s; Train 2 mismatches in lower half (e.g., expected rows 17-23 have specific 8/9 patterns for a shape, generated fills them with 1s/0s).
 * No object extraction function present, but one would be essential to identify and relocate 8-blobs as units (e.g., find connected 8 components, compute their centroid, shift to grid center).
 * Program copies grid correctly and uses neutral 0, but doesn't handle multi-dominant areas (e.g., Train 2 has competing 1/4) or edge cases like 8s outside bbox.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it over-fills with dominant 7 across most of the grid (e.g., rows 7-30 are nearly uniform 7s with side 1/2/3 borders), erasing likely object details like clustered 8s/9s/4s (e.g., row 5 has 8s scattered and partially filled, but expected probably preserves a central 8-shape with 9-eyes intact, similar to Train 1/2 patterns).
 * Small components like 0/9 in rows 3-6 (e.g., 9 at row 5 col 5) are filled or ignored incorrectly, creating solid 7 blocks where holes/eyes should remain; 8s in rows 3-12 are shifted/misplaced (e.g., row 9 has 8s at end, but likely should be centered without overwriting 7s).
 * Borders (1s left, 3s right, 4s top) are preserved somewhat, but internal structures (e.g., row 6's 3/4 anomalies) are lost to 7-filling, mismatched from trainings where such details stay; the uniform lower rows suggest over-aggressive filling without bbox limiting or object protection.
 * No clear central repositioning of 8s (they're smeared right/down), and extra 0s persist in places (e.g., row 9 cols 20-22), indicating the shift function failed similarly to trainings; overall, it looks like a "washed out" version missing the visual puzzle's key elements (e.g., a face or symbol formed by 8/9).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulations where input grids have framed content areas with a background color and scattered "disturbed" (anomalous) rows forming shapes or objects. The goal is to detect frames, identify and group consecutive disturbed rows, reverse the order within each group (to "correct" or unscramble them), optionally adjust/shift elements within rows, and reposition these reversed groups to the bottom of the content area with clean background rows filling the top and single-row gaps separating groups, while preserving the overall grid structure including frames.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have uniform top/bottom frame rows (often 1-2 rows of a single color like 1's or 4's) and left/right borders (often 2 columns wide, e.g., 1's or 4's), which must be preserved; content area starts after top frame and ends before bottom frame.
 * Background color (bg) is the most common value in the content area (e.g., 5 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in test); disturbed rows are those differing from a "standard" clean row (bg-filled content with borders intact) in the content area only—borders and frames should not be considered disturbed.
 * Anomalies form vertical groups of consecutive disturbed rows representing shapes; these must be collected as intact groups without splitting, then reversed internally (row order flipped, but columns unchanged unless shifting is needed).
 * Reversed groups are placed starting from the bottom of the content area upward, with exactly one clean (bg) row as a gap between groups; remaining space above is filled with clean rows to maintain content height.
 * Subtle: No horizontal shifting or per-group adjustments unless explicitly needed to align shapes (current attempts overdo this, causing mismatches); shapes may have internal variations (e.g., 8/9 as parts of 8-shapes) that must stay intact during reversal.
 * Bottom frame must be re-added if content expansion requires it; total height must match input.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-clean content (return unchanged); multiple small groups vs. one large; anomalies touching borders (ignore border columns for disturbance check); sampling bg from initial content rows only to avoid bias from anomalies.
 * Across attempts: Over-reliance on fixed left/right widths (2) works for samples but may fail if variable; reversal is within-group only, not global; placement must calculate top clean rows precisely as content_h - total_disturbed_rows - (num_groups - 1).

The following function is unhelpful/broken: `shift_shape_right`—it applies arbitrary horizontal shifts (e.g., by 1 or 2) to "anomaly parts," but this distorts shapes incorrectly (e.g., moves 8/9 pixels without preserving object integrity) and isn't needed for core reversal/placement; it causes mismatches in all samples by scattering elements instead of keeping groups intact. Avoid in future; shapes may not need shifting, or it should be rule-based (e.g., align to left of content).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt partially understands frame detection, bg identification, and disturbed group collection/reversal, but fails on placement (groups not positioned correctly at bottom with proper gaps, leading to scattered or top-placed anomalies) and adds unnecessary shifts that break shape coherence.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps some top-frame 1's and partial 4's/5's but places reversed groups too high/mixed with originals (e.g., row 3 has 8,9,9 instead of expected 8,8,8,8,2; row 4 has 8,8,8,8,5,8,5 vs. expected 4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2); bottom clean rows are all 5's but lack the expected consolidated 4,4 borders and shape rearrangements (e.g., no 1,8,8,9 in row 6); overall, reversal happens but shifts distort (e.g., 8's moved right incorrectly), and groups aren't gapped/placed low enough—13 rows output but shapes overlap top content.
 * Train 2: Generated fills top with clean 2's (correct frame?) but then dumps all content as uniform 1's for many rows (ignores disturbances), places a single messed-up group low (e.g., row 12 has 2,9,2 vs. expected 1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1; row 13 has 4,8,8,9,8,1,8,1 vs. expected 1,1,4,8,8,9,8,8,1,1), and adds bottom 3's frame incorrectly early; misses multiple groups (e.g., separate 8/9 clusters not reversed separately), over-applies bg=1 washing out shapes, and placement ignores gaps (groups concatenated without separation); bottom has extra mismatched rows like row 18 with 8,8,8,1,1,8,3,1 vs. expected consolidated lower shapes.
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better group extraction (current reverse_disturbed_groups is helpful but misses multi-group separation in train 2).
 * Over-assumes fixed shifts per group (e.g., idx==0 shift=1) causes unknown distortions (e.g., why 9's move left in train 1 row 3?); no handling for variable frame widths.
 * Function `shift_shape_right` is broken/unhelpful (distorts without rules, e.g., fills with bg incorrectly, moves only if next is bg—leads to partial shifts like in test row 20).
 * Core reversal/placement logic is on track but execution fails due to bad integration (e.g., result builds from top frame but appends without clearing original content).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it preserves top 4-frames well but treats much of the content as disturbed incorrectly (e.g., rows 3-11 show uniform 7's with 2's in positions 15,17—likely failed to group 2's/9's as separate small anomalies, instead scattering them via shifts), leading to non-coherent shapes (e.g., row 20 has isolated 2,7,2,7,2 vs. expected consolidated group like a reversed 2/8-pattern at bottom; row 22 has 7,8,7,8,7,8 vs. expected intact reversed block). Placement is wrong—no clear bottom-grouping with gaps (anomalies like 9's in row 12-14 and 8's in 20-26 are mid-grid and fragmented, not reversed/lowered as a unit); bg=7 is detected but clean fills are missing (e.g., no top clean 7's before groups). This suggests over-shifting broke groups (e.g., 9's in row 6 moved down but not grouped), and no proper gap calculation (excess rows stay disturbed). To handle test, need stricter group collection (treat sparse 2/9 as one group?) and disable shifts; expected likely has 2/8/9 shapes reversed and stacked at bottom with 7-cleans above and 3-frame below.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, likely representing a "canvas" or image that needs to be vertically flipped or reversed between uniform border rows (top and bottom), while preserving those borders, to match evolving patterns across multiple frames or examples. The goal is to process a sequence of grids (as a list of rows) and output the transformed version that aligns with expected visual changes, such as correcting orientations or symmetries in drawn objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify uniform rows (all elements identical) at the top and bottom as fixed borders that should not be altered or included in any reversal.
 * The "canvas" is the non-uniform middle section between borders; it must be reversed vertically (i.e., flip the order of rows in this section) to correct the orientation, but only if it matches the puzzle's visual logic—subtly, not all middle rows may need full reversal if they contain partial patterns or evolving elements.
 * Patterns in the middle often represent "objects" or shapes (e.g., sequences of 8s forming a blob or line, 9s as highlights, or mixed numbers like 1,2 for structures) that evolve across rows; reversal should preserve their internal structure but flip their vertical position to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Uniformity check must be strict (empty rows are uniform, but grids are non-empty); borders may vary in thickness (multiple consecutive uniform rows); reversal applies only to the canvas, but if borders are misidentified (e.g., a nearly uniform row with one outlier is not uniform), the canvas slice is wrong, leading to partial reversals or unchanged rows.
 * Across examples, top borders are often solid (e.g., all 1s or 5s), bottom are solid (e.g., all 2s or 3s), and canvas has asymmetric patterns that need flipping to symmetrize or correct (e.g., in training 1, row 3 expected has 8s ending with 2, suggesting a shape adjustment post-reversal).
 * Easy to miss: Reversal is row-order flip, not element-level; some rows in canvas may appear uniform after reversal but weren't before; evolving frames mean the program must handle varying border sizes and non-symmetric objects; test grids have wider dimensions (28 columns vs 26 in training), so code must be dimension-agnostic.
 * Considerations from attempts: Over-reversing includes border rows if uniformity is mischecked; under-reversing leaves canvas intact when it should flip; objects like 8-clusters or 9-dots may need extraction to verify post-reversal shapes, but simple reversal alone fails if borders shift per row.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_uniform(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not row:
        return True
    c = row[0]
    return all(x == c for x in row)
```
(This function correctly identifies uniform rows for border detection; it's reliable and should be reused.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    top = 0
    while top < n and is_uniform(g[top]):
        top += 1
    bottom = 0
    while bottom < n - top and is_uniform(g[n - 1 - bottom]):
        bottom += 1
    canvas_start = top
    canvas_end = n - bottom
    canvas = g[canvas_start:canvas_end]
    reversed_canvas = canvas[::-1]
    return g[:canvas_start] + reversed_canvas + g[canvas_end:]
```
(This is the core program from the attempt; it correctly slices and reverses the canvas but fails on border precision and full pattern matching—helpful as a base but needs refinement for object-aware reversal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and skips multi-row uniform borders (e.g., in training 1, it skips top all-1s/5s and bottom all-2s correctly in many rows), preserving them unchanged, which matches expected outputs where borders stay static.
 * Reversal of the canvas works partially for simple cases (e.g., in training 1 rows 1-2 and 10-13, generated matches expected all-5s/1s with 4,4 inserts), but fails when canvas contains asymmetric objects: e.g., training 1 row 3 generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,9,9,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,2,2]—generated has 8,9,9,8 (wrong shape, extra 9s, no 2 inserts) instead of solid 8s with 2s, suggesting reversal didn't align the blob correctly or mis-sliced canvas.
 * In training 1 row 4, generated [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,8,9,5,8,5,5,5,2,2]—minor mismatch in canvas reversal (e.g., 4 placement wrong, 9 not flipped properly), indicating border detection skipped too few rows or reversal order is off for evolving patterns.
 * Training 1 row 5 generated has scattered 2s and 8s not matching expected clustered 8s with 2s; row 6 has 1s and 8s misplaced vs expected 1,8,8,9 cluster—unknown why reversal creates these outliers, possibly because canvas includes semi-uniform rows.
 * Training 2 shows similar issues: borders (top all-2s, bottom all-3s, side 4,4 and 7,7) preserved well, but canvas reversal fails badly—e.g., row 11 generated [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7] vs expected [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,2,2,1,1,7,7], where generated inserts wrong 4s instead of flipping to include 2,9 pattern; row 14 generated has scattered 8s/9s/3 not matching expected 8-clusters.
 * Overall, attempt understands border uniformity (worked for static parts) but not canvas object evolution (didn't work: reversal misaligns shapes like 8-blobs or 9-dots, leading to extra/missing numbers); no object extraction attempted, which might help verify shapes post-reversal.
 * Function `is_uniform` is helpful and correct; the slicing logic in `program` is mostly sound but broken for variable canvas content (e.g., doesn't handle intra-row patterns or why some rows stay unchanged when they should flip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate puzzle understanding, as it mostly preserves or partially reverses the canvas but mangles object patterns similarly to training failures—e.g., rows 6-7 have scattered 9s in 7-clusters ([1,1,7,7,7,9,7,...] vs likely expected solid 7s with flipped 9-position for symmetry), and row 20 has [...,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,3,3] which introduces misplaced 2s not aligning with any clear flipped shape (expected might cluster 2s/8s/9s vertically from input patterns like row 12's 9s).
 * Lower rows (e.g., 24-28) show chaotic mixes like [1,1,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,...] and [1,1,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,...] vs input's more structured 7s/2s/3s—reversal seems to flip but not correct orientations (e.g., 8,9 clusters appear fragmented, missing expected merges or border integrations like training's 2-inserts); overall, it looks like incomplete flipping without object awareness, so borders (top all-4s, bottom all-3s?) are handled but canvas shapes (7-blobs, 2/8/9 elements) are distorted, not making visual sense as a corrected image.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to preprocess and transform the grid by identifying a background color, detecting vertical dividing bars to split the grid into panels, and applying specific rules to merge small isolated shapes, shift maroon (color 8) shapes upward within panels, and reposition light blue (color 9) shapes relative to red/yellow (colors 2/4) in the same row. The transformations aim to normalize or consolidate elements for further puzzle solving, such as object extraction or pattern matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the flattened grid; assume it's 0 or similar neutral, but confirm via Counter.
 * Dividing bars are full-height vertical columns (or sequences of columns) of uniform non-background color; they must span the entire height (h rows) with no variation in that column.
 * Panels are rectangular regions between bars (from left=0 to w-1 if no bars); each panel is defined by (left_col, right_col, top=0, bottom=h-1), assuming no horizontal divisions.
 * Small shapes to merge: Isolated pixels or tiny groups (colors 2,4,9) with <=1 neighbor (in 4 directions, within panel bounds); count self + neighbors <=2 total pixels per group, but code checks per cell.
 * Merging: Up to 3 small pixels per panel are cleared to background, then "placed" (overwritten) in the bottom row starting from left of panel; this seems like consolidating small debris to the panel's bottom-left corner.
 * Maroon (8) transformation: Shift entire vertical stacks or blobs upward by up to 5 rows (min(shift, distance to panel top)) without overlapping existing cells; track moved positions to avoid double-shifts.
 * Light blue (9) repositioning: Move to immediately right of a red/yellow (2 or 4) in the same row within the panel if possible; if no such position, try right of first global red/yellow or leave in place; avoid overwriting.
 * Process order matters: Merge small shapes first, then shift maroon, then reposition light blue; apply transformations per panel to avoid cross-panel interference.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns unchanged; single panel if no bars; small panels may have no space for placements; neighbors only count same color and within panel; shifts avoid going above panel top.
 * Subtle: "Small shapes" may include diagonals or not (code uses 4-dir orthogonal); merging only up to 3 per panel, even if more exist; light blue move only if exact row match for target, else fallback.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal bars/divisions not handled (assumes vertical only); color 9 might be part of larger shapes, but code treats individually; background != small colors; errors if no red/yellow for repositioning.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using frequency count; useful as a starting point.)

```python
def identify_dividing_bars(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < w:
        col = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != background:
            start = c
            color = col[0]
            c += 1
            while c < w:
                col_next = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
                if len(set(col_next)) == 1 and col_next[0] == color:
                    c += 1
                else:
                    break
            end = c - 1
            bars.append((start, end, color))
        else:
            c += 1
    return bars
```
(This detects contiguous full-height vertical bars of uniform non-background color; helpful for splitting grid, but assumes no gaps in bar color.)

```python
def identify_panels(bars: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    if not bars:
        return [(0, w - 1, 0, h - 1)] if w > 0 and h > 0 else []
    panels = []
    left = 0
    for start, end, _ in bars:
        if left < start:
            panels.append((left, start - 1, 0, h - 1))
        left = end + 1
    if left < w:
        panels.append((left, w - 1, 0, h - 1))
    return panels
```
(This derives panels as regions between/around bars; core for localizing transformations, but fixed to full height.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented background detection, bar/panel identification, and the three main transformations (merge small, shift maroon, reposition light blue), showing partial understanding of core rules like panel isolation and color-specific moves.
 * What worked: Background finding via Counter is robust and likely correct; bar detection handles contiguous columns well; panel derivation correctly splits regions; small shape neighbor check (4-dir, within panel) captures isolation; maroon shift logic avoids overlap and respects panel bounds.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors on all examples—blank error on Train 1 (possibly index out-of-bounds or empty grid handling); tuple concatenation error on Train 2 and Test (traced to reposition_light_blue: unpacking `next(...)` (tuple) with `red_yellow_pos[0]` (tuple) but fallback `red_yellow_pos[0]` when next fails, causing (tuple, tuple) but error mentions "int", likely when red_yellow_pos empty or mismatched types like pc+1 as int in condition).
 * Merge_small_shapes partially works but may over-merge (collects all small pixels then takes [:3], but doesn't group true connected components—treats isolated cells only); placement overwrites bottom-left without checking if it's background or free.
 * Transform_maroon_shapes shifts per cell, not per connected blob, potentially fragmenting shapes; min(5, r - p_top) is good but doesn't handle horizontal extent of maroon.
 * Reposition_light_blue collects global red/yellow but tries per-panel; next() fallback to red_yellow_pos[0] causes type error if no matches (unpacking tuple with potentially int-mixed); doesn't handle multiple 9s or overwriting.
 * No object extraction function attempted (e.g., to identify full shapes post-transform); program assumes fixed colors (2=red,4=yellow,8=maroon,9=light blue) without verification.
 * Overall, syntax/logic bugs prevent any output; Train 1 error unknown but possibly empty panels or h/w=0; no observed generated grids to compare, so can't verify if transformations match expected (e.g., small shapes consolidated correctly).
 * Function merge_small_shapes is buggy (small_pixels collected but merged without connectivity, placement may overlap bars); transform_maroon_shapes is helpful but incomplete for blobs; reposition_light_blue is broken (type error, unclear fallback); identify_dividing_bars is solid but misses non-full-height bars if puzzle has partial ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple"), so no grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected transformed grid.
 * Without output, can't verify if it correctly merges small 2/4/9 pixels to bottom-left, shifts 8s up by <=5 rows per panel, or moves 9s right of 2/4 in-row; likely fails early in reposition_light_blue due to empty red_yellow_pos or next() unpacking.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Assuming test grid has background 0, vertical bars (e.g., color 1 or 5 full columns), panels with scattered small 2/4/9 (isolated, <=1 neighbor each), vertical 8 stacks, and 9s near but not adjacent to 2/4—output should have panels with smalls cleared and stacked at bottom-left (up to 3 colors preserved), 8s lifted up within panel tops, 9s shifted right to touch 2/4 in row; differs from error by actually producing a valid grid.
 * Error indicates unhandled case (no red/yellow for 9 repositioning), so test likely has panels without 2/4, causing fallback failure—must fix to leave 9s in place if no targets.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid representing comic book panels divided by vertical bars, where the goal is to process and rearrange elements like small shapes (e.g., red=2, yellow=4, orange=9), maroon blobs (8), and other colors against a background, following rules for consolidation, shifting, and repositioning to match a stylized or corrected layout. The program attempts to automate this by identifying panels, merging small components, shifting maroons upward, and moving 9's adjacent to certain colors, but it fails to produce exact matches due to incorrect handling of component detection, placement logic, and panel-specific rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are defined by vertical dividing bars (full-height columns of uniform non-background color), but the code assumes all bars span the entire height and width correctly; subtle issue: bars might not always be full-height or could be interrupted, leading to misidentified panels (e.g., in train 1, panels seem split around columns 12-13 for 4's).
 * Background is correctly identified as the most common color (e.g., 5 in train 1, 1 or 7 in others), but ensure it's not confused with sparse elements; all operations clear to background.
 * Small shapes (components of 2, 4, or 9 with size <=2 cells) are cleared from panels and relocated to the bottom-left of the panel (up to 3 per panel, starting from left edge), but this ignores shape connectivity across panel boundaries or larger components; in train 1 generated, small 2's and 4's are over-consolidated and misplaced, while expected keeps some dispersed.
 * Maroon (8) components are found via flood-fill (4-connected), sorted by max row (bottom-to-top), and shifted up by min(5, available space above per column), but shifting clears originals and places shifted versions; subtlety: space calculation uses min across columns in the component, but doesn't account for overlapping shifts or panel constraints— in train 1 generated, 8's are shifted too much or in wrong clusters (e.g., row 2 has scattered 8's vs. expected clustered in row 2 cols 17-20).
 * 9's (orange?) are repositioned right-to-left per row, moving rightward to the position immediately after the rightmost 2 or 4 in the same panel/row if space (background) is available; key miss: it only moves if a candidate exists left of current position, and stays if not— in train 1 generated, 9's in row 12 are placed at cols 3-5 and 15-17 but expected has none visible (possibly cleared or merged); also ignores vertical alignment or multi-row components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right, no diagonals), and operations are panel-local for small shapes but global for maroons and 9's; easy to miss: don't merge across panels, and limit placements to avoid overwriting non-background.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., train 1: 13x26, train 2: 25x26, test: ~30x28?), so functions must handle variable h/w; colors like 1 (dark blue?), 3 (green?), 7 (light green?) seem static or panel separators, not to be moved.
 * Overall: Preserve non-target elements (e.g., 1's, 3's, 7's as backgrounds or frames); process in sequence (small shapes first, then maroons, then 9's) to avoid overwriting; expected outputs show stylized comic art with 8's forming figures, 9's as highlights near 2/4, and small shapes reduced/minimalized.
 * Subtle: In expected train 1, some 2's appear in unexpected places (e.g., row 2 col 21), suggesting not all small shapes are cleared—perhaps only isolated <=2 size, and originals might persist if >2 or connected differently.
 * Another subtlety: Maroon shifts are capped at 5, but only if space exists above (checking upward from min row per col); in train 2 generated, 8's are shifted prematurely, creating gaps not in expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all clearing/shifting operations; used successfully in all examples to detect 5, 1, or 7.)

```python
def identify_dividing_bars(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < w:
        col = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != background:
            start = c
            color = col[0]
            c += 1
            while c < w:
                col_next = [grid[r][c] for r in range(h)]
                if len(set(col_next)) == 1 and col_next[0] == color:
                    c += 1
                else:
                    break
            end = c - 1
            bars.append((start, end, color))
        else:
            c += 1
    return bars
```
(This detects contiguous full-height vertical bars of uniform non-bg color, crucial for panel division; works well but assumes no gaps in bars—helpful for train 1/2 panel splits around cols 12-13.)

```python
def identify_panels(bars: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    if not bars:
        return [(0, w - 1, 0, h - 1)] if w > 0 and h > 0 else []
    panels = []
    left = 0
    for start, end, _ in bars:
        if left < start:
            panels.append((left, start - 1, 0, h - 1))
        left = end + 1
    if left < w:
        panels.append((left, w - 1, 0, h - 1))
    return panels
```
(This derives rectangular panels (left, right, top=0, bottom=h-1) between bars; useful for localizing small shape processing, but assumes top-to-bottom full height—panels in examples are horizontal strips.)

```python
def find_maroon_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] == 8:
                num = 8
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == 8:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, num))
    return components
```
(This performs flood-fill to extract connected 8-components; helpful for shifting, but sorting by max row (bottom-first) is key—used in code but shifts too aggressively in examples.)

(The small shape merging logic in the main program is partially helpful for detecting <=2 size components of 2/4/9 via local flood-fill, but broken for placement: it collects all small but only places first 3 at bottom-left, ignoring per-panel counts or originals >2; the 9-repositioning loop is useful but flawed in candidate selection—only moves left-of-current 2/4 positions, leading to no-move cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies background, bars, and panels in both trainings (e.g., train 1 bars at cols 12-13 as 4's, splitting left/right panels), and extracts maroon components accurately, but fails on small shape handling: in train 1, it clears and over-places 2/4/9 at bottoms (e.g., row 12 has extra 9's at left/right), while expected disperses or omits some (e.g., no bottom placements, 9's integrated differently); in train 2, small 2/9 placements create invalid clusters (e.g., row 11 has 2's/9's not in expected).
 * Maroon shifting works partially (detects clusters), but over-shifts or miscalculates space: train 1 generated has 8's scattered in rows 1-4/8-10 (e.g., row 1 cols 6-8), vs. expected clustered in row 2 cols 17-20 and row 4 col 17; train 2 generated shifts 8's too early (e.g., row 11 has 8's in left panel, but expected has them in row 12-13 right panel with 9's nearby).
 * 9-repositioning is mostly broken: in train 1, it places 9's in row 12 left/right but expected has 9's embedded (e.g., row 3 col 18, row 5 col 21); in train 2, generated puts 9's in row 11 col 19 and row 18 col 6, but expected has them in row 18 col 6 (partial match) and row 19 col 6 (shifted wrong).
 * Overall, sequence is logical (small first, then maroon, then 9), but ignores component size >2 (expected preserves larger 2/4/8), and placement overwrites backgrounds incorrectly; train 1 mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (e.g., expected row 3 has 8's+2 mix, generated has isolated 8's); train 2 mismatches by introducing extra 8/9 in wrong panels.
 * Function for small shape detection is helpful but incomplete (needs to skip >2 or connected to larger); bar/panel functions are solid and reusable.
 * No other prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of panel division and component extraction, but not full rearrangement rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it retains too many original elements without proper consolidation/shifting (e.g., scattered 8's in rows 2-3 cols 4-8/10-11, 9's in rows 6-7/18-19 cols 16-17/7-8, but expected likely clusters 8's upward into figures and moves 9's adjacent to 2's in right panel cols 14-15).
 * It fails to clear/merge small 2/4/9: e.g., isolated 2's in rows 2-17 cols 14-15 persist, but expected would relocate <=2 size to bottoms; 9's in row 29 col 0 seem un repositioned left of 2's.
 * Maroon (8) components are not shifted up enough or at all in some cases (e.g., row 3 has 8's at original positions, but with bg=7 dominant, space above should allow min(5) shift, clustering them higher like in train expected).
 * Panels seem misidentified (bars possibly at cols 2/26 as 4/3? but code assumes full-height; generated has vertical 1's at cols 0-1, suggesting left frame not treated as bar, leading to one big panel and no local merging).
 * Overall, output looks like minimally processed input with some anomalies (e.g., row 6 has 3 in col 2, possibly unhandled color), not matching stylized comic rules—e.g., no bottom placements for small shapes, 9's not snapped right of 2's per row/panel; unknown why 4's fill top rows entirely (perhaps bg confusion, but 7 is more common).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity on colored cells, where connected groups (blobs) of non-background cells fall downward as rigid units (without rotating or deforming) until they rest on the bottom of the grid or other stable blobs, processed in a specific order to handle interactions correctly. The goal is to apply this gravity step once, preserving colors and connections while treating the background as empty space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) components of any non-background cells, ignoring color differences within the blob—colors stay the same during falls.
 * Background detection: Prefer 0 if present anywhere in the grid; otherwise, use the most frequent color as background (this handles grids without explicit empties).
 * Drop mechanics: Blobs fall rigidly, so the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background cells below the lowest point in each occupied column of the blob—this ensures the entire blob can drop without parts getting stuck unevenly.
 * Processing order: Sort and process blobs from bottom-to-top (by maximum row index, descending) to simulate sequential falling without upper blobs interfering with lower ones prematurely; update the grid after each blob's drop.
 * Clearing and placement: Before dropping a blob, temporarily clear its original positions to background for accurate drop calculation (avoids self-interference), then place the shifted blob; clip placements if they go out of bounds (though grids seem fixed-height).
 * Subtle elements: Falls are per-blob, not per-cell (no individual pixel drops like sand); rigid means no tilting/rotation, so min-drop across columns preserves shape. Multiple passes aren't needed—single application per program call. Blobs might span multiple colors but fall as one if connected. In examples, background isn't always 0 (e.g., possibly 5 in ex1 top rows, or 2 in ex2 top). Watch for floating blobs that should stack precisely without overlapping or merging post-fall. Order matters: bottom-first prevents chain reactions where a falling upper blob lands on a just-fallen lower one incorrectly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Compute drops on a temp grid after clearing the blob itself (prevents overestimating space below). If no background below, drop=0 (already resting). Grids are rectangular, rows from top (index 0) to bottom (higher indices).
 * All considerations: No diagonal connections (strict 4-way). Blobs with no cells below don't move. Post-drop, new connections might form but aren't re-blobbed in one step (single gravity application). Handle empty grids or all-background gracefully (return unchanged).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:** The `apply_gravity` function in this attempt is flawed—it processes blobs sequentially on an updating grid but computes drops on a temp-cleared grid, which works conceptually but fails in practice due to incorrect min-drop logic (causes blobs to under-drop or misalign rigidly). Don't reuse as-is; the temp-clear step is good but integration with updates causes ordering issues.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it demonstrates core understanding of blobs, rigid drops, and bottom-up processing but fails both training examples due to incorrect blob placements post-drop.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps top 5-heavy rows static (correct), but the 8/9 blob in mid-rows falls incorrectly—e.g., row 8 has 8's at cols 5-7 but expected has them shifted differently; row 9 has scattered 1's and 8/9's mismatched (generated has 8,9,8 at cols 16-18, expected has 8,8,8 at cols 16-18 but in different rows); row 10 has 8's over-dropped or mispositioned vs expected 8,9 at cols 8-9. Bottom 2's static (correct). Unknown why 4's and some 5's don't interact properly—possibly min-drop too conservative, preventing full rigid fall.
 * Train 2: Generated has top 2's static (correct), mid 4/1/7 rows mostly static but with erroneous 8/9 intrusions in lower rows (e.g., row 17 has 8's at end, not in expected); bottom 3's static (correct). But key mismatch: expected has 2/9/8 blobs falling precisely (e.g., row 11 expected has 2's at cols 16-19, but generated piles 1's/8's wrong); row 18-20 have 8/9/7 scattered vs expected structured 8's and 1's. Over-clearing or wrong order causes chain misplacements.
 * Blob finding and sorting work (identifies components correctly), but drop computation and placement fail to preserve rigid shapes across interactions—e.g., upper blobs don't account for just-fallen lower ones accurately.
 * Temp-clear in apply_gravity is a good idea for isolation but breaks when sequential updates aren't re-blobbing (no re-detection of new connections post-drop).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it shows excessive piling of 7's, 2's, and scattered 8/9/1/3/4 elements toward the bottom/mid, with top rows all 4's (possibly static background?) and uniform stacking (e.g., rows 7-25 mostly 7's in cols 2-13 and 16-24, 2's in cols 14-15), but this ignores rigid shapes: e.g., the complex 7/8/9 blob in input (rows 2-5, cols 2-13) should fall as a unit, preserving its irregular shape (like the 9 at row3 col5), not flattening into solid 7's; the right-side 1/8/9/2/4 elements (cols 20+) are mangled (e.g., row 6 has 8,8 at cols 20-21 but input has 1,7), suggesting over-drop or non-rigid merging. Bottom 3's are static (likely correct), but left 1's and mid 2's are homogenized wrong—expected should have staggered falls (e.g., left 1's drop less than mid 7's due to supports), not this blocky stack. Doesn't match training patterns where shapes preserve (e.g., ex1's 8/9 clusters stay clustered).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle simulating gravity where non-background blocks connected in 4-way adjacent groups of the same color form rigid "components" that fall downward as intact units, processed from the bottom of the grid upward to avoid interference, until they stack on other blocks or the bottom, with the background color being the most common value in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection must use the most frequent color across the entire flat grid, but handle empty grids gracefully (default to 0).
 * Connected components include single blocks and are strictly same-color and 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding background.
 * Components must be processed in bottom-to-top order by sorting on the maximum row index (highest row number first, assuming row 0 is top), to simulate gravity without later drops affecting earlier ones.
 * For dropping: Each component is cleared from the grid first, then the drop distance is the *minimum* number of consecutive background spaces below the lowest point of the component in each of its occupied columns (starting from just below that lowest row in the column).
 * Dropped positions must not exceed grid bounds; if the new row would be out of bounds, the block stays or clips, but in practice, it seems to cap at grid height.
 * Subtlety: Drop calculation is per-column lowest point, but the whole component shifts rigidly by the min drop across its columns, preserving relative positions (e.g., multi-column shapes don't rotate or separate).
 * Components can span multiple columns, and drop is limited by the "tightest" column (least space below), which can cause uneven stacking if columns have different obstacles.
 * After dropping one component, the grid updates, so subsequent components see the new state (e.g., they might land on previously dropped ones).
 * No merging or re-connection after drops; components remain as they were.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length), rows are lists of ints (colors 0-9 likely), and output must be a new grid with exact same dimensions.
 * Easy to miss: Processing order is critical—top-down would cause overlaps or incorrect stacking; also, "lowest" is max row index per column for the component.
 * Empty spaces are only background; non-background blocks block drops.
 * Singles and small groups must be treated identically to large ones.

from typing import List, Tuple

```
(This correctly identifies components with positions as (row, col) tuples and color, using DFS/stack for connectivity; essential for rigid unit extraction.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (e.g., 5 in example 1, 2 in example 2) and finds connected components accurately, including singles and multi-block shapes.
 * Sorting components bottom-to-top by max row works in principle to process gravity order.
 * Clearing component before drop and attempting rigid shift by min column drop distance captures the core rigid-body fall idea.
 * Train 1 generated output keeps top rows unchanged (all 5s and some 1s/4s/2s static, which is correct for non-falling parts), but fails to properly drop lower components: e.g., 8s and 9s in rows 7-11 are misplaced or not dropped far enough (generated has 8s scattered in row 9-11 without forming expected clusters like [8,8,8,8] in row 2 of expected), and a 1 in row 7 col 18 is wrong (expected has 8 there); also, row 4 expected has 8s/9s/4s/2s in specific positions, but generated has incorrect 5s/8s/9s scattering—likely due to flawed per-column lowest calc or not updating grid properly for subsequent drops.
 * Train 2 generated output correctly keeps top 2s and bottom 3s static, and stacks some 4s/1s/7s in upper rows, but messes up lower drops: e.g., row 11 expected has 2s/9/2s but generated has all 1s/7s; row 17 expected has 1s but generated has 8s misplaced; row 20 expected has 4/8/9/1s but generated has scattered 8s/9s/4s/2s/3s in wrong spots—drop distance underestimates space in some columns, causing partial overlaps or insufficient fall; also, 3 in row 23 expected but generated has 9/1s there.
 * Overall, drop logic fails: col_lowest uses max i per column (correct for lowest point), but count of backgrounds below starts from lowest+1 and stops at first non-background (correct), yet min(d) across columns leads to too-small drops, as seen in both trains where components don't reach expected stacked positions (e.g., 8-group in train 1 should drop more to row 2-4 area).
 * No rotation or color change, which is correct, but grid copy (new_g) is good to avoid mutating original.
 * Function get_background and find_connected_components are helpful and accurate; main program drop calc is broken (under-drops, possibly miscounts empties after prior clears).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the inf drop init and stack-based DFS are solid—avoid recursive DFS to prevent stack overflow in large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with two full rows of 4s (possibly assuming 4 as background, but input likely has different bg—wait, input not shown, but output has 4s filling top, which shouldn't happen as static parts should remain), then repeats [1,1,7s,2s,7s,3s] blocks identically across rows 2-20 without variation, indicating no drops occurred for most components (rigid 7/2/3 strips didn't fall), and bottom rows 21-30 have chaotic scattering of 1/7/8/9/2/4/3 (e.g., row 29 has mixed 1/4/3/9/9/7/9/9/8/8/7/1/7/2/2/7/7/7/7/9/7/7/2/2/4/3/3, far from any stacked order)—this suggests components weren't cleared/dropped properly, min-drop was 0 for many (no fall), or sorting failed, leading to static copy with minor bottom jumble; expected should have upper static rows, then fallen 7/8/9 groups stacking rigidly from bottom (e.g., 8s/9s dropping into lower rows without overlap, preserving shapes like vertical 7 strips but shifted down by column-min empties).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:59:11] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving image cleanup or object stabilization, where the most common value is treated as background, small connected non-background components (noise or debris) are removed by filling them with background, and remaining elements are then shifted via gravity simulation (upwards for smaller grids, downwards for larger ones) to settle against fixed borders, preserving the overall structure of larger blobs or patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically detected as the most frequent value in the entire grid, which works well for uniform backgrounds but could fail if patterns have near-equal frequencies or if borders are not purely background.
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-directional adjacency) of fewer than 3 non-background cells within a "content" area excluding fixed borders (top/bottom 2 rows, left 2 columns, right 3 columns), which ignores border-adjacent noise but risks missing small components touching borders that should perhaps be preserved or handled differently.
 * Gravity is applied iteratively in passes (up to height times) by swapping non-background cells with adjacent background cells in the direction of gravity, but only within content bounds indirectly; for upwards gravity (height <=16), it pulls elements toward the fixed top (starting from row fixed_top+1 downward), and for downwards (height >16), it pushes toward the fixed bottom (starting from near-bottom upward), which may not fully simulate physics if components are irregularly shaped or if multiple passes don't converge properly.
 * Fixed borders (2 rows top/bottom, 2-3 cols sides) act as "frames" that elements settle against but are not modified, suggesting the puzzle preserves structural elements like dividers or walls.
 * Connected components use DFS via stack for flood-fill, which is efficient but assumes 4-connectivity (no diagonals), potentially splitting diagonal-adjacent cells into separate components that might be intended as one.
 * Gravity direction flips at height 16, implying smaller grids "float up" (e.g., bubbles rising) while larger ones "fall down" (e.g., sand settling), a subtle rule that mismatches could cause inversion of expected settling.
 * No rotation, color changes, or matching/removal of same-color groups beyond small components—focus is purely on size-based cleanup and directional settling.
 * Outputs are flattened rows for comparison, so mismatches are in specific cell values/positions post-processing.
 * Potential edge cases: empty grids return unchanged; components exactly size 3 are preserved; gravity stops if no changes in a pass or after max_passes to prevent infinite loops; side columns (min_c=2, max_c=width-3) exclude rightmost more than left, which might be asymmetric for certain patterns.
 * Subtle miss: Gravity functions have bugs, e.g., in apply_gravity_down, the condition "r + 1 < height - fixed_bottom + fixed_bottom" simplifies to "< height" but may not respect fixed_bottom properly; also, loops start from fixed areas incorrectly, leading to over-shifting or no-shift in borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count, useful for dynamic grids.)

```python
def find_and_fill_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for j in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if not visited[i][j] and out[i][j] != bg:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if min_r <= nx <= max_r and min_c <= ny <= max_c and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and out[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(component) < 3:
                    for x, y in component:
                        out[x][y] = bg
    return out
```
(This performs flood-fill to detect and remove small (<3 cell) connected components in a bounded area, essential for noise reduction; however, the bounds check "0 <= ny < width" is redundant/misplaced since j is already in min_c to max_c, but it's mostly functional.)

```python
def apply_gravity_up(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, fixed_top: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    changed = True
    passes = 0
    max_passes = height
    while changed and passes < max_passes:
        changed = False
        for r in range(fixed_top + 1, height):
            for c in range(width):
                if out[r][c] != bg and r - 1 >= fixed_top and out[r - 1][c] == bg:
                    out[r - 1][c], out[r][c] = out[r][c], out[r - 1][c]
                    changed = True
        passes += 1
    return out

def apply_gravity_down(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, fixed_bottom: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    height, width = len(g), len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    changed = True
    passes = 0
    max_passes = height
    while changed and passes < max_passes:
        changed = False
        for r in range(height - 2, fixed_bottom - 1, -1):
            for c in range(width):
                if out[r][c] != bg and r + 1 < height - fixed_bottom + fixed_bottom and out[r + 1][c] == bg:
                    out[r + 1][c], out[r][c] = out[r][c], out[r + 1][c]
                    changed = True
        passes += 1
    return out
```
(These simulate per-column gravity by bubbling/swapping cells iteratively; up-version pulls toward top, down toward bottom. Helpful for settling, but down-version has buggy bounds like "r + 1 < height" effectively ignoring fixed_bottom, and loop starts too high, causing incomplete settling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly detects background (e.g., 5 in train1, 2 in train2 top rows) and removes some small components, but fails to fully settle larger blobs via gravity, leading to mismatched positions.
 * In train1 (height=13 <=16, so up-gravity), generated keeps scattered 8s/9s/4s in mid-rows without pulling them fully to the top content area as in expected (e.g., expected row2 has 5s where generated has 8s/4s; row3 expected clusters 8s rightward, but generated scatters them left; unknown why 1s/2s don't shift identically—possibly incomplete passes or border exclusion preventing full upward pull).
 * In train1, small components like isolated 9s or pairs of 8s are not all filled (e.g., generated row4 has 9 not filled, expected moves it during gravity instead), suggesting threshold or connectivity misses diagonals or border-touching groups.
 * In train2 (height=25 >16, so down-gravity), generated incorrectly fills top two rows entirely with 2 (background?) despite them being empty in input (implied), and fails to settle bottom patterns downward (e.g., expected keeps upper 1s stable but clusters 8s/9s/2s lower-right in rows11-23, while generated scatters 7s/8s/9s without proper falling, and adds erroneous 7s in row17+ where expected has 1s).
 * Train2 generated over-applies filling or gravity outside content bounds, e.g., row17 has 7s filling where expected preserves 1s, and bottom 3s are unchanged but mid has misplaced 8s/9s (difference: generated doesn't cluster 2s/9s in row11 as expected, unknown if due to small-component removal eating into larger blobs).
 * Borders are preserved correctly (e.g., left 1s/4s, right 2s/7s/3s unchanged), but content_min_c=2 and max_c=width-3 excludes too much right side, missing small components there (e.g., train2 expected removes/fills some right 1s/8s differently).
 * Gravity functions are partially helpful but broken: up works somewhat for train1 top stability but not full pull; down fails in train2 by not respecting fixed_bottom=2, causing elements to fall past or not at all, and the condition "r + 1 < height - fixed_bottom + fixed_bottom" is tautological (= < height), allowing shifts into bottom border.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs beyond small removal—missing a function to identify/settle large connected groups as units, which might preserve shapes better than cell-by-cell swapping.
 * Overall, attempt understands cleanup+gravity core but misses precise settling physics, border symmetry, and component size thresholds for preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (height=30? >16, so down-gravity applied) does not look correct: it fills top two rows entirely with 4s (possibly mistaking border or over-filling), then repeats uniform 1-7-2-3 striped columns in rows2-23 without variation, suggesting small-component removal wiped out most pattern details, and gravity down didn't settle anything meaningfully (e.g., bottom rows24-30 have scattered 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s but not clustered against bottom as expected for down-gravity).
 * Compared to implied input (scattered 7s/8s/9s/4s/3s in lower rows, uniform stripes above), expected should preserve large 7-blobs falling to bottom rows28-30, cluster 8s/9s rightward against fixed sides, remove only tiny isolates (e.g., single 1s), and keep upper stripes stable—but generated uniformizes too much, with 2s/3s misplaced (e.g., row24 has 1s where expected might have fallen 7s; row29 has chaotic 8s/9s/2s/4s not settled).
 * Test mismatches in asymmetry: right side (cols25-28) has extra 8s/9s not pulled down fully, and left 1s/4s unchanged but mid 7s over-spread; this doesn't make sense as correct output, likely because content_max_c=width-3 (28-3=25?) excludes right noise removal, and down-gravity loop buggy, preventing proper bottom settling—output looks like partial removal without physics simulation.

[2025-10-01 23:59:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:09:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images composed of colored pixels (integers representing colors), where the goal is to process a noisy or imperfect input grid to produce a cleaned-up version that matches expected patterns of distinct shapes or objects separated by background colors, likely by removing noise, filling gaps/holes, extending borders, and correcting shape anomalies without hardcoding specific positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the dominant color as background (e.g., 5 in training 1, possibly 2 or 1 in training 2), but be cautious as backgrounds can vary by section (e.g., top rows may be uniform background, while shapes occupy middle sections, and bottom may have another uniform layer).
 * Remove isolated non-background cells surrounded by background on all four sides, but only apply this away from borders to avoid altering intentional edges; this helps eliminate single-pixel noise but may miss diagonal or clustered noise.
 * Fill small background gaps (holes) inside non-background regions if surrounded by 3+ neighbors of the same single non-background color, but this simple rule fails for larger or irregularly shaped holes and can overfill if neighbors aren't uniformly the same color.
 * Shapes appear to be contiguous blobs of the same or related colors (e.g., 8's forming outlines or fills, 9's as accents), often with borders (e.g., 1 on left, 2 on right, 4 in middles), and may represent specific objects like letters, numbers, or icons that need precise positioning without bleeding into background.
 * Subtle elements include avoiding over-adjustment near borders (e.g., don't extend colors arbitrarily based on row modulo conditions), handling multi-section grids (e.g., upper/lower shapes in taller grids), and recognizing that 0's may be undefined/empty and should be filled contextually (e.g., nearest color) rather than defaulting blindly.
 * Patterns suggest symmetry or repetition (e.g., repeated rows of background at top/bottom, vertical borders), and corrections often involve swapping or adding specific colors like 8/9 in shape interiors without altering overall blob connectivity.
 * Grids vary in size (13x26 for train 1, 26x26 for train 2, 30x28 for test), so rules must scale generally rather than hardcode row/column indices; consider flood-fill for better blob detection but avoid deep recursion.
 * Easy-to-miss: Some "noise" is actually part of shapes (e.g., isolated 4's or 9's that should remain), and expected outputs simplify complex areas (e.g., replacing clusters of mixed colors with uniform fills or removals).
 * Across attempts, dominant color detection works but downstream functions like gap-filling can create new errors (e.g., turning valid backgrounds into shape colors); always validate against full grid context, including vertical alignments across rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter
import copy

def find_dominant_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the most common color in the grid as background. Helpful for initial bg detection."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (color, start_row, start_col) for each blob
    """Extract contiguous non-bg regions (blobs) using simple flood-fill or BFS to identify shapes. Useful for targeted adjustments without hardcoding."""
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                # Simple BFS to find blob start (expand if needed for full coords)
                queue = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.pop(0)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                blobs.append((color, i, j))
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program structure composes logical steps (bg detection, noise removal, gap filling, border extension, shape adjustment), which is a good high-level approach, but it fails both trainings due to overly simplistic or hardcoded rules that don't generalize.
 * find_dominant_color works correctly (identifies 5 as bg in train 1, likely 2 in train 2), but replace_isolated_cells and fill_small_gaps introduce errors by over-removing or over-filling (e.g., in train 1, it removes valid shape elements like isolated 1's or 4's, leading to mismatches in rows 4-8).
 * extend_borders is unhelpful and broken: its pattern-matching (e.g., checking for 1 next to two 5's and using i % 2) is arbitrary and doesn't apply to the grids, resulting in no changes or wrong extensions; it doesn't trigger in trainings and should be removed or generalized to propagate border colors only if adjacent to matching blobs.
 * adjust_shapes is the most problematic: it's heavily hardcoded for specific grid sizes/positions (e.g., setting new_g[5][6] = 1 for 13-row grids, adding 8's to row 2 cols 17-21), which partially matches some train 1 elements (e.g., adds 8's in row 2/3) but creates new errors (e.g., places 1's and 9's where expected has 5's or 8's); for train 2, it adds unwanted 8/9 clusters in rows 12-13 where expected has simpler 1's or 2's; this doesn't scale and ignores general shape rules—avoid hardcoding in future.
 * Specific differences in train 1 generated vs expected: Row 3 has extra 8's at cols 17-20 (generated: 8,8,8,8,2 vs expected: 8,8,8,8,2—wait, similar but row 4 has 4,8,5,5,8 vs expected 4,8,9,5,8; row 5 has 8,8,1,8 vs expected 8,8,4,5? Wait, actually row 5 generated [1,1,5,5,5,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2] vs expected [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,5,8,2,5,5,2,2]—major mismatches in shape positions like missing 4's and extra 8's; rows 6-8 have misplaced 1's and 9's (e.g., row 6 gen: 8,8,1,8,9 vs exp: 5,5,1,8,8,9); overall, generated has fragmented shapes and extra fills, while expected has cleaner, connected blobs with specific accents (e.g., 9's in precise spots, unknown why some 5's remain unfilled).
 * Specific differences in train 2 generated vs expected: Rows 3-7 have extra 8/9 intrusions into what should be uniform 1's (e.g., row 4 gen: 1,1,8,8,1 vs exp all 1's; row 5 gen: 4,8,8,8,8,8 vs exp all 1's after borders); row 12 gen: 1,8,8,1,8,1 vs exp: 1,2,2,9,2,2,1 (misplaces 8's instead of 2/9 pattern); rows 18-24 gen has scattered 8/9/4/3 where exp has uniform 1's or structured shapes (e.g., row 18 gen: 4,4,1,1,4,8,8,8,8,7,... vs exp: 4,4,1,1,1,8,8,7,... with specific 8/7/9 placements); bottom rows match 3's correctly, but upper shapes are overcomplicated—generated fragments simple horizontal bars into noisy blobs, while expected keeps clean lines and isolated features like 9's.
 * No training samples pass, indicating core issue is lack of robust blob/shape recognition (e.g., no flood-fill to preserve connectivity); the 0-filling in adjust_shapes defaults to 1 blindly, which may not fit test contexts.
 * Function replace_isolated_cells is somewhat helpful for noise but too aggressive (misses that some "isolated" cells are shape edges); fill_small_gaps is broken for non-rectangular holes (e.g., fails diagonal gaps, overfills in train 2); overall, attempt shows partial understanding of noise removal but misses shape integrity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears minimally processed: it retains much of the input's noise (e.g., scattered 8/9/4/3 within 7-bg areas, like row 3: 7,7,8,7,8,8 vs potentially needing cleanup to uniform shapes; row 7 has 7,3,7,7,3,3 which seem like unresolved isolated elements). 
 * It fills some 0's? (not shown in input, but assuming present) with defaults, but results in fragmented shapes (e.g., row 9: 7,9,8,8,1 vs expected likely connected blobs without the 1 intrusion); borders are inconsistent (left 1's, right 3's, middle 2's, but extensions like row 12's 2,7,7,2,2 look partial/unfinished).
 * No major cleaning happens—e.g., upper shapes (rows 3-6) have holes/uniformity issues (8,9,8,8 scattered in 7's) that a correct output should fill or remove to form solid objects; lower sections (rows 19+) repeat uniform 7's correctly but upper mismatches suggest failure to detect/ adjust blobs generally; without expected, it doesn't make sense as a "cleaned" puzzle, as it preserves too much irregularity compared to trainings' simplified expectations.

[2025-10-02 00:09:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
