=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 20:02:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

[2025-09-30 20:14:52] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for shape parts) to identify and mark "enclosed" or "vulnerable" regions within shapes using 7s, likely simulating rules for collapsing or highlighting holes, dangling edges, and boundary exposures in a 2D structure like a cave or blob. The goal is to apply iterative rules for pruning loose ends, detecting closed/open holes, and propagating marks to adjacent cells, ultimately transforming the grid to match expected patterns where 7s fill internal voids or exposed areas without altering the overall shape topology.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling parts) by setting them to 0 if they have fewer than 2 orthogonal neighbors that are 1s, but only after initial passes to avoid over-pruning connected structures.
 * Detect closed holes: A 0 cell fully surrounded by 4 adjacent 1s marks those neighbors as 7s, indicating an enclosed void that "traps" or highlights the boundary.
 * Propagate 7s: Any 1 adjacent to a 7 becomes 7, but this should be iterative and applied after initial marking to fill entire enclosed regions without leaking to open areas.
 * Handle open boundaries: For top-row 0s between two 1s with a 1 below, mark adjacent 1s as 7s (simulating exposure at the top edge); similarly for right-edge 0s with vertical and left neighbors as 1s.
 * Subtle edge cases: Propagation must not cross open holes (e.g., 0s on boundaries shouldn't trigger full fills); multiple iterations may be needed for propagation, but single passes in the code lead to incomplete fills; dangling prune should happen first but not remove parts that later connect via propagation.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x19 in ex1, 16x16 in ex2, 16x16 in ex3), with empty rows/columns; ignore all-0 areas; 7s should only appear in 1-regions that form loops or exposures, not isolated 1s.
 * Order matters: Pruning before hole detection prevents false positives; propagation last to avoid marking open areas; open-top/right rules seem specific to boundary exposures but miss bottom/left symmetries or diagonal considerations (though rules appear orthogonal-only).
 * No diagonals in neighbor counts; only up/down/left/right; 7s don't count as neighbors for pruning or hole detection (they're marked 1s effectively for connectivity but flagged for removal/fill).
 * Potential for multi-step: Some expected 7s form blobs (e.g., vertical/horizontal fills in ex1 bottom and ex3), suggesting flood-fill-like behavior from seeds like closed holes or open edges.

    # Not helpful as-is; over-specific and doesn't propagate.

def set_adjacent_to_open_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar issue: Only right edge, partial pattern match, misses bottom/left; in ex2/ex3, no right exposures triggered correctly, leading to missing 7s (e.g., ex2 row0-1 col14-15).
    # Broken for asymmetric boundaries; expand to all edges or generalize to any boundary 0 with 3 neighbors.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage: ex1 generated scattered 7s in top but missed major fills in rows 4-6 col7-10 (expected blob of 7s around hole) and bottom shapes (e.g., row10-13 col5-7 all 7s); also left dangling 0s unfilled.
 * Ex2: Generated extra 7s in row4 col14 and incomplete fills (e.g., row7 col9=0 instead of 7, row8 col13=7 but expected 1); missed top-right exposure (row0-1 col14-15 as 7s) and bottom fills (row12-14 col5-9).
 * Ex3: Over-pruned or under-marked central shape; generated 7s in row5-8 col9-12 but missed expected hole fills (e.g., row6 col10=0 should be 7-bound, row12 col6-8=7s); bottom row13 all 0s instead of partial 7s.
 * Prune_dangling worked for some isolations but applied too early/late, removing parts needed for connectivity (e.g., ex1 row2 col16=0 correct, but affected propagation).
 * Closed_holes detected some internals (e.g., ex2 row6-9 col7-10) but didn't chain with propagation, leaving partial 7s (e.g., ex1 row4 col3=1 instead of 1 but surrounded).
 * Propagation single-pass failed long chains (e.g., ex1 vertical 7s in col15-16 incomplete; ex3 row11-12 col6-8 missed spread).
 * Open_top/right functions triggered minimally (e.g., ex1 top marked some but not the irregular hole at row0-2 col2-4); ignored other edges, missing ex3 bottom exposures.
 * Order in program() (prune -> open_top -> open_right -> closed_holes -> propagate) logical but insufficient iterations; no handling for multiple holes per shape or boundary vs. internal distinction.
 * No object extraction, leading to global rules missing per-blob contexts (e.g., ex1 has multiple shapes, but rules didn't isolate them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly prunes top rows to 0s where isolated, marks a central blob of 7s in rows4-9 col4-7 (simulating a hole fill), and leaves boundaries as 1s, which aligns with a single large shape with internal exposure.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Missing propagation to full enclosed regions (e.g., row4 col5-7 should likely fill more horizontally/vertically like ex1's bottom blob, but stops abruptly); top-left 1s remain unmarked despite potential open-top exposure (row0-3 col0-4 all 1s, but expected 7s if dangling or open); right side row9-11 col12-13=1 but may need 7s if exposed; bottom rows13-15 all 1s in col0-4 but 0s elsewhere—likely under-pruned, as ex3 showed need for bottom fills; overall, 7s form a partial "cave" but don't match expected symmetry (e.g., no 7s in row10-11 col0-4, which looks like an open bottom needing marks).
 * Compared to training, it over-relies on central hole detection but misses edge rules (no top/right triggers visible), leading to incomplete 7-blobs; if correct output should mirror ex1's multi-shape fills, this test needs more iterative propagation and symmetric edge handling.

```python
# Note: No extract_objects function in this attempt, but one could be added to identify connected components of 1s/7s for better hole detection (e.g., using DFS/BFS to count enclosed 0s per blob).
# Current attempt lacks this; it might help avoid global scans and focus on per-shape rules.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def set_adjacent_to_open_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken/incomplete: Only checks top row for specific pattern (0 between two 1s with 1 below), but misses general top exposures or iterations; in ex1, it marked some but not the full top-left hole; doesn't handle non-top rows or left/right symmetries.
    # Not helpful as-is; over-specific and doesn't propagate.

def set_adjacent_to_open_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar issue: Only right edge, partial pattern match, misses bottom/left; in ex2/ex3, no right exposures triggered correctly, leading to missing 7s (e.g., ex2 row0-1 col14-15).
    # Broken for asymmetric boundaries; expand to all edges or generalize to any boundary 0 with 3 neighbors.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage: ex1 generated scattered 7s in top but missed major fills in rows 4-6 col7-10 (expected blob of 7s around hole) and bottom shapes (e.g., row10-13 col5-7 all 7s); also left dangling 0s unfilled.
 * Ex2: Generated extra 7s in row4 col14 and incomplete fills (e.g., row7 col9=0 instead of 7, row8 col13=7 but expected 1); missed top-right exposure (row0-1 col14-15 as 7s) and bottom fills (row12-14 col5-9).
 * Ex3: Over-pruned or under-marked central shape; generated 7s in row5-8 col9-12 but missed expected hole fills (e.g., row6 col10=0 should be 7-bound, row12 col6-8=7s); bottom row13 all 0s instead of partial 7s.
 * Prune_dangling worked for some isolations but applied too early/late, removing parts needed for connectivity (e.g., ex1 row2 col16=0 correct, but affected propagation).
 * Closed_holes detected some internals (e.g., ex2 row6-9 col7-10) but didn't chain with propagation, leaving partial 7s (e.g., ex1 row4 col3=1 instead of 1 but surrounded).
 * Propagation single-pass failed long chains (e.g., ex1 vertical 7s in col15-16 incomplete; ex3 row11-12 col6-8 missed spread).
 * Open_top/right functions triggered minimally (e.g., ex1 top marked some but not the irregular hole at row0-2 col2-4); ignored other edges, missing ex3 bottom exposures.
 * Order in program() (prune -> open_top -> open_right -> closed_holes -> propagate) logical but insufficient iterations; no handling for multiple holes per shape or boundary vs. internal distinction.
 * No object extraction, leading to global rules missing per-blob contexts (e.g., ex1 has multiple shapes, but rules didn't isolate them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly prunes top rows to 0s where isolated, marks a central blob of 7s in rows4-9 col4-7 (simulating a hole fill), and leaves boundaries as 1s, which aligns with a single large shape with internal exposure.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Missing propagation to full enclosed regions (e.g., row4 col5-7 should likely fill more horizontally/vertically like ex1's bottom blob, but stops abruptly); top-left 1s remain unmarked despite potential open-top exposure (row0-3 col0-4 all 1s, but expected 7s if dangling or open); right side row9-11 col12-13=1 but may need 7s if exposed; bottom rows13-15 all 1s in col0-4 but 0s elsewhere—likely under-pruned, as ex3 showed need for bottom fills; overall, 7s form a partial "cave" but don't match expected symmetry (e.g., no 7s in row10-11 col0-4, which looks like an open bottom needing marks).
 * Compared to training, it over-relies on central hole detection but misses edge rules (no top/right triggers visible), leading to incomplete 7-blobs; if correct output should mirror ex1's multi-shape fills, this test needs more iterative propagation and symmetric edge handling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:19:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty space, 1s for filled/shape pixels) where the goal is to identify and mark specific "notch" or indentation patterns on the boundaries of enclosed or semi-enclosed shapes using 7s, while pruning dangling or isolated 1s. The process simulates edge detection or boundary refinement, focusing on horizontal and vertical notches that indicate corners or indents in puzzle pieces, with rules prioritizing enclosed structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling edges) first to clean up the grid before marking, using a neighbor count threshold of <2 to remove them, but ensure this doesn't affect valid boundary pixels.
 * Mark single horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-1 patterns in a row, but only if vertically enclosed (above or below is 1 or edge), then mark the flanking 1s and adjacent vertical neighbors as 7s; subtle: for open-below cases, check if the below cell has <2 neighbors to propagate marking downward.
 * Mark double horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-0-1 patterns, require vertical enclosure on both 0s, mark flanking 1s and nearby vertical segments; subtle: extend marking horizontally in the enclosing row to cover connected 1s within a small range (e.g., j-1 to j+3).
 * Mark vertical notches on edges: For left/right boundaries, detect 1-0 or 0-1 at column 0 or cols-1, mark the inner 1 and adjacent verticals if enclosed; subtle: vertical notches may need separate handling from horizontal ones to avoid overlap, and enclosure checks must include top/bottom edges.
 * All markings should preserve original 1s/0s but overlay 7s only on boundary 1s that form notches; avoid marking internal 1s or non-boundary areas.
 * Process in sequence: prune -> single notches -> double notches -> vertical notches, as later steps depend on cleaned grids.
 * Subtle enclosure: "Has enclosure" means at least one vertical side (above or below) has 1s covering the notch width; for open sides, use neighbor counts to infer loose enclosure.
 * Grids can have multiple disconnected shapes; markings are local to each.
 * No diagonal considerations in current rules, but future may need them for complex shapes.
 * Outputs use 7 to indicate marked boundaries, but 0s and unmarked 1s remain as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Propagating marks to adjacent cells in enclosing rows only if they are 1s; over-marking in open areas; failing to handle edge cases like notches at grid boundaries or multi-row indents.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 generated incorrect output: In row 16 (0-indexed), generated all 0s [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] but expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0], indicating failure to mark a horizontal notch or enclosure in the lower-right area; upper rows matched perfectly, suggesting the issue is with detecting distant or vertically open notches.
 * Training example 2 and 3 were correct, so core logic for single/double notches and pruning works for those shapes.
 * mark_single_notches partially works but misses propagation in some open-below cases, as seen in training 1's row 16 discrepancy.
 * mark_double_notches seems effective for wider indents but may not interact well with vertical marks.
 * mark_vertical_notches handles edges but likely incomplete for non-edge vertical indents; it only checks left/right columns, missing internal vertical notches.
 * Overall, the sequential processing works, but enclosure checks are too strict for bottom-open notches, leading to missed markings in training 1.
 * No extraction functions for objects/shapes were used or needed; the grid is processed in-place locally, so global object extraction isn't relevant (don't use it).
 * The count_1_neighbors function is helpful and correct for neighbor-based decisions.
 * prune_dangling is essential and working, as it cleans without affecting valid structures in correct examples.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows reasonable markings: e.g., 7s outlining what appear to be two main shapes (left blob and right structure with indents), with pruning likely removing the top-right empty areas; single/double notches marked horizontally in rows 3-12, and vertical on edges.
 * It looks mostly correct based on visual inspection—7s trace boundaries and indents without over-marking internals, and 0s remain in empty spaces; however, without the expected output, it's hard to confirm subtle misses like in training 1 (e.g., potential unmarked bottom enclosures in rows 12-15).
 * The output handles the test's complex shape (irregular blob on left, indented form on right) better than training 1's failure, suggesting improvements in propagation, but row 12 has [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] which might miss a vertical notch extension if the shape requires it.
 * No obvious errors like over-pruning or wrong 7 placements, but the all-0 trailing areas (columns 14-15) are correctly unpruned as they seem part of the input structure; if the test expects more 7s in bottom rows, the enclosure logic may still be the weak point.

[2025-09-30 20:19:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for shape parts) to identify and mark "enclosed" or "vulnerable" regions within shapes using 7s, likely simulating rules for collapsing or highlighting holes, dangling edges, and boundary exposures in a 2D structure like a cave or blob. The goal is to apply iterative rules for pruning loose ends, detecting closed/open holes, and propagating marks to adjacent cells, ultimately transforming the grid to match expected patterns where 7s fill internal voids or exposed areas without altering the overall shape topology.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling parts) by setting them to 0 if they have fewer than 2 orthogonal neighbors that are 1s, but only after initial passes to avoid over-pruning connected structures.
 * Detect closed holes: A 0 cell fully surrounded by 4 adjacent 1s marks those neighbors as 7s, indicating an enclosed void that "traps" or highlights the boundary.
 * Propagate 7s: Any 1 adjacent to a 7 becomes 7, but this should be iterative and applied after initial marking to fill entire enclosed regions without leaking to open areas.
 * Handle open boundaries: For top-row 0s between two 1s with a 1 below, mark adjacent 1s as 7s (simulating exposure at the top edge); similarly for right-edge 0s with vertical and left neighbors as 1s.
 * Subtle edge cases: Propagation must not cross open holes (e.g., 0s on boundaries shouldn't trigger full fills); multiple iterations may be needed for propagation, but single passes in the code lead to incomplete fills; dangling prune should happen first but not remove parts that later connect via propagation.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x19 in ex1, 16x16 in ex2, 16x16 in ex3), with empty rows/columns; ignore all-0 areas; 7s should only appear in 1-regions that form loops or exposures, not isolated 1s.
 * Order matters: Pruning before hole detection prevents false positives; propagation last to avoid marking open areas; open-top/right rules seem specific to boundary exposures but miss bottom/left symmetries or diagonal considerations (though rules appear orthogonal-only).
 * No diagonals in neighbor counts; only up/down/left/right; 7s don't count as neighbors for pruning or hole detection (they're marked 1s effectively for connectivity but flagged for removal/fill).
 * Potential for multi-step: Some expected 7s form blobs (e.g., vertical/horizontal fills in ex1 bottom and ex3), suggesting flood-fill-like behavior from seeds like closed holes or open edges.

    # Not helpful as-is; over-specific and doesn't propagate.

def set_adjacent_to_open_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar issue: Only right edge, partial pattern match, misses bottom/left; in ex2/ex3, no right exposures triggered correctly, leading to missing 7s (e.g., ex2 row0-1 col14-15).
    # Broken for asymmetric boundaries; expand to all edges or generalize to any boundary 0 with 3 neighbors.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage: ex1 generated scattered 7s in top but missed major fills in rows 4-6 col7-10 (expected blob of 7s around hole) and bottom shapes (e.g., row10-13 col5-7 all 7s); also left dangling 0s unfilled.
 * Ex2: Generated extra 7s in row4 col14 and incomplete fills (e.g., row7 col9=0 instead of 7, row8 col13=7 but expected 1); missed top-right exposure (row0-1 col14-15 as 7s) and bottom fills (row12-14 col5-9).
 * Ex3: Over-pruned or under-marked central shape; generated 7s in row5-8 col9-12 but missed expected hole fills (e.g., row6 col10=0 should be 7-bound, row12 col6-8=7s); bottom row13 all 0s instead of partial 7s.
 * Prune_dangling worked for some isolations but applied too early/late, removing parts needed for connectivity (e.g., ex1 row2 col16=0 correct, but affected propagation).
 * Closed_holes detected some internals (e.g., ex2 row6-9 col7-10) but didn't chain with propagation, leaving partial 7s (e.g., ex1 row4 col3=1 instead of 1 but surrounded).
 * Propagation single-pass failed long chains (e.g., ex1 vertical 7s in col15-16 incomplete; ex3 row11-12 col6-8 missed spread).
 * Open_top/right functions triggered minimally (e.g., ex1 top marked some but not the irregular hole at row0-2 col2-4); ignored other edges, missing ex3 bottom exposures.
 * Order in program() (prune -> open_top -> open_right -> closed_holes -> propagate) logical but insufficient iterations; no handling for multiple holes per shape or boundary vs. internal distinction.
 * No object extraction, leading to global rules missing per-blob contexts (e.g., ex1 has multiple shapes, but rules didn't isolate them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly prunes top rows to 0s where isolated, marks a central blob of 7s in rows4-9 col4-7 (simulating a hole fill), and leaves boundaries as 1s, which aligns with a single large shape with internal exposure.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Missing propagation to full enclosed regions (e.g., row4 col5-7 should likely fill more horizontally/vertically like ex1's bottom blob, but stops abruptly); top-left 1s remain unmarked despite potential open-top exposure (row0-3 col0-4 all 1s, but expected 7s if dangling or open); right side row9-11 col12-13=1 but may need 7s if exposed; bottom rows13-15 all 1s in col0-4 but 0s elsewhere—likely under-pruned, as ex3 showed need for bottom fills; overall, 7s form a partial "cave" but don't match expected symmetry (e.g., no 7s in row10-11 col0-4, which looks like an open bottom needing marks).
 * Compared to training, it over-relies on central hole detection but misses edge rules (no top/right triggers visible), leading to incomplete 7-blobs; if correct output should mirror ex1's multi-shape fills, this test needs more iterative propagation and symmetric edge handling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty space, 1s for filled/shape pixels) where the goal is to identify and mark specific "notch" or indentation patterns on the boundaries of enclosed or semi-enclosed shapes using 7s, while pruning dangling or isolated 1s. The process simulates edge detection or boundary refinement, focusing on horizontal and vertical notches that indicate corners or indents in puzzle pieces, with rules prioritizing enclosed structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling edges) first to clean up the grid before marking, using a neighbor count threshold of <2 to remove them, but ensure this doesn't affect valid boundary pixels.
 * Mark single horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-1 patterns in a row, but only if vertically enclosed (above or below is 1 or edge), then mark the flanking 1s and adjacent vertical neighbors as 7s; subtle: for open-below cases, check if the below cell has <2 neighbors to propagate marking downward.
 * Mark double horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-0-1 patterns, require vertical enclosure on both 0s, mark flanking 1s and nearby vertical segments; subtle: extend marking horizontally in the enclosing row to cover connected 1s within a small range (e.g., j-1 to j+3).
 * Mark vertical notches on edges: For left/right boundaries, detect 1-0 or 0-1 at column 0 or cols-1, mark the inner 1 and adjacent verticals if enclosed; subtle: vertical notches may need separate handling from horizontal ones to avoid overlap, and enclosure checks must include top/bottom edges.
 * All markings should preserve original 1s/0s but overlay 7s only on boundary 1s that form notches; avoid marking internal 1s or non-boundary areas.
 * Process in sequence: prune -> single notches -> double notches -> vertical notches, as later steps depend on cleaned grids.
 * Subtle enclosure: "Has enclosure" means at least one vertical side (above or below) has 1s covering the notch width; for open sides, use neighbor counts to infer loose enclosure.
 * Grids can have multiple disconnected shapes; markings are local to each.
 * No diagonal considerations in current rules, but future may need them for complex shapes.
 * Outputs use 7 to indicate marked boundaries, but 0s and unmarked 1s remain as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Propagating marks to adjacent cells in enclosing rows only if they are 1s; over-marking in open areas; failing to handle edge cases like notches at grid boundaries or multi-row indents.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 generated incorrect output: In row 16 (0-indexed), generated all 0s [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] but expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0], indicating failure to mark a horizontal notch or enclosure in the lower-right area; upper rows matched perfectly, suggesting the issue is with detecting distant or vertically open notches.
 * Training example 2 and 3 were correct, so core logic for single/double notches and pruning works for those shapes.
 * mark_single_notches partially works but misses propagation in some open-below cases, as seen in training 1's row 16 discrepancy.
 * mark_double_notches seems effective for wider indents but may not interact well with vertical marks.
 * mark_vertical_notches handles edges but likely incomplete for non-edge vertical indents; it only checks left/right columns, missing internal vertical notches.
 * Overall, the sequential processing works, but enclosure checks are too strict for bottom-open notches, leading to missed markings in training 1.
 * No extraction functions for objects/shapes were used or needed; the grid is processed in-place locally, so global object extraction isn't relevant (don't use it).
 * The count_1_neighbors function is helpful and correct for neighbor-based decisions.
 * prune_dangling is essential and working, as it cleans without affecting valid structures in correct examples.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows reasonable markings: e.g., 7s outlining what appear to be two main shapes (left blob and right structure with indents), with pruning likely removing the top-right empty areas; single/double notches marked horizontally in rows 3-12, and vertical on edges.
 * It looks mostly correct based on visual inspection—7s trace boundaries and indents without over-marking internals, and 0s remain in empty spaces; however, without the expected output, it's hard to confirm subtle misses like in training 1 (e.g., potential unmarked bottom enclosures in rows 12-15).
 * The output handles the test's complex shape (irregular blob on left, indented form on right) better than training 1's failure, suggesting improvements in propagation, but row 12 has [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] which might miss a vertical notch extension if the shape requires it.
 * No obvious errors like over-pruning or wrong 7 placements, but the all-0 trailing areas (columns 14-15) are correctly unpruned as they seem part of the input structure; if the test expects more 7s in bottom rows, the enclosure logic may still be the weak point.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:33:57] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (possibly a variant of enclosure or loop puzzles like Slitherlink or area-claiming games) where the input grid consists of 1s (solid elements like walls or lines) and 0s (empty spaces or holes), and the goal is to output a modified grid that prunes invalid or dangling structures, identifies enclosed or partially open regions, and marks boundaries or closures with 7s to highlight valid enclosures while leaving unsolved or open areas as 0 or 1.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune "dangling" 1s that have fewer than 2 adjacent 1s ( orthogonally: up, down, left, right), as they don't form stable structures; this removes isolated or weakly connected lines but should not affect core loops or enclosures.
 * Identify closed holes (0s fully surrounded by 4 adjacent 1s) and mark their adjacent 1s as 7s to indicate enclosure boundaries; subtle: this only applies to fully enclosed 0s, not partial ones.
 * Mark open edges of potential enclosures: for top row, detect 0s between two 1s and mark surrounding 1s and below cells as 7s; for right column, similar for vertical opens; for bottom, reverse top logic; subtle: these handle boundary openings but must avoid over-marking internal structures.
 * Propagate markings horizontally: if a 1 is adjacent to a 7, mark it as 7 to extend boundary detection, but only one step at a time and only horizontally in this implementation; subtle: may need vertical or multi-directional propagation, and limiting to horizontal misses vertical chains.
 * Overall process order matters: prune first, then mark opens, then closed holes, then propagate; repeating propagation helps but may not suffice for complex shapes.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16 in examples), with empty rows/columns; ignore edges if out-of-bounds.
 * 7s seem to represent "claimed" or "boundary" cells, but do not overwrite 0s—only modify 1s to 7s.
 * Subtle elements: Open markings assume specific patterns (e.g., 0 between two 1s on edge), but may miss diagonal considerations or multi-cell opens; propagation is incomplete, leading to partial chains; dangling prune is correct but interacts poorly with later markings if not iterated.
 * No diagonal adjacency considered—only orthogonal.
 * Empty areas (all 0s) should remain 0s; solid lines of 1s may need partial marking if they form enclosure edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def prune_dangling(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # This function correctly removes 1s with <2 orthogonal 1-neighbors, simulating stability removal.
    # Helpful for initial cleanup, but may need iteration if new danglers form.
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):

                n += 1
            if j < cols - 1 and new_g[i][j + 1] == 1:
                n += 1
            if n < 2:
                new_g[i][j] = 0
    return new_g
```

```python
def set_adjacent_to_closed_holes(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Detects fully enclosed 0s (4 adjacent 1s) and marks neighbors as 7; helpful for identifying complete enclosures.
    # Subtle bug: marks all four directions even if not all are 1s, but condition checks n==4 first—mostly correct but placed late in pipeline.
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):

                        new_g[i + 1][j] = 7
                    if j > 0 and g[i][j - 1] == 1:
                        new_g[i][j - 1] = 7
                    if j < cols - 1 and g[i][j + 1] == 1:
                        new_g[i][j + 1] = 7
    return new_g
```

```python
# Note: mark_open_top, mark_open_right, mark_open_bottom are partially helpful for edge cases but buggy (e.g., over-mark internal cells, wrong directions for bottom/right).
# propagate_horizontal_one_step is somewhat helpful for chain extension but limited to horizontal and one step—needs expansion to vertical/full flood-fill.
# No extraction functions provided; could add one to identify connected components of 1s for better enclosure detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic gaps in enclosure detection and propagation.
 * Training example 1: Generated over-marked top-left enclosure (e.g., row 0: [1,7,7,0,7,7,7,...] vs expected [1,1,7,0,7,1,1,...]) and bottom (row 17 missing some 0s/7s); missed partial opens in mid-section (row 10-12 expected more 0s inside); propagation didn't fill vertical chains properly; prune_dangling worked but open marking over-applied 7s horizontally.
 * Training example 1 subtle: Row 11 expected [1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7,1,...] but generated all 7s in middle, suggesting faulty bottom-open detection filling too much.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrect right-edge markings (e.g., row 0 ends [...,1,0] vs expected [...,7,0]; row 6 [...,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,0,7]); missed internal hole patterns (row 7 expected [1,7,0,7,1,...] but generated [7,7,0,7,...]); propagation horizontal-only left vertical 1s unmarked; open_right over-marked without checking full open condition.
 * Training example 2 subtle: Bottom section (rows 12-15) generated solid 1s but expected partial 7s and 0s in a enclosure, indicating set_adjacent_to_closed_holes didn't trigger or was ordered wrong.
 * Training example 3: Generated incomplete mid-enclosure (row 6: [...,1,7,7,7,0,7,...] vs expected [...,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,...]); bottom (row 12) marked too few 7s ([...,7,7,7,0,7,...] vs expected [...,1,1,7,0,7,...]); missed vertical propagation in left structure; mark_open_bottom applied incorrectly, filling from top-down instead of bottom-up.
 * Training example 3 subtle: Upper enclosure (rows 5-9) expected asymmetric 7s around 0s but generated symmetric overfill, likely from horizontal propagation ignoring shape.
 * Overall: Functions like prune_dangling and set_adjacent_to_closed_holes are helpful and mostly correct but need better integration; mark_open_top/right/bottom are broken (wrong cell targeting, e.g., bottom marks below instead of above); propagate_horizontal_one_step is unhelpful as-is (too limited, misses vertical/directional needs—don't reuse without expansion); no iteration on prune or full flood-fill leads to partial results.
 * Pipeline order issue: Marking opens before closed holes causes premature 7s to interfere; limited propagation (only twice, horizontal) fails complex shapes.
 * No handling for multi-cell holes or open enclosures that aren't single 0s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-marks several enclosures and misses nuanced partial opens/closures, similar to training failures.
 * Top-left (rows 0-2) all 1s except edges, but likely should have some 7s on open top if pattern matches training (e.g., expected partial 7s like in train1 row0); generated keeps too many 1s.
 * Mid-enclosure (rows 3-5): Generated [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,0,7,7,0,0] for row3, but expected might preserve more 1s around the 0 (like train3's asymmetric); over-propagated 7s rightward.
 * Central structure (rows 6-9): Heavy 7-marking (e.g., row7 all 7s in middle) vs likely expected mix of 1s/0s/7s for open hole (similar to train2 row7 [1,7,0,7,...]); misses internal 0 preservation.
 * Bottom (rows 11-13): Row11 [1,1,1,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,1,...] overfills vs expected possible [1,1,1,1,7,0,7,...] like train1; row12 has trailing 0s but generated [1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,...], suggesting incomplete right-open handling.
 * Overall, test output shows same issues as training: excessive horizontal 7-propagation, incorrect open-edge marking (e.g., right column has dangling 0s unmarked), and failure to detect subtle enclosure shapes; does not make sense for a valid solution as it creates overly filled regions without respecting open 0s.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 20:34:10] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-09-30 20:35:01] Response:
### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on the provided train examples (all three pairs), I analyzed the components for obvious, direct interactions or effects between properties (e.g., position influencing position, pixel count affecting pixel count, holes influencing holes, color changes tied to spatial properties). Only interactions present in **every** train example are listed below. I focused on low-level properties like those specified (bbox/position, holes, pixels, color). No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving attempts were made. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel components with no changes) were excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., exact pixel subtraction doesn't hold perfectly across all due to minor discrepancies in totals, possibly from overlaps or unlisted merges) are noted as unknown where they can't be directly linked. No forced connections for semantic shapes, as they aren't identifiable from the data alone.

#### 1. **Color Transformation Linked to Input Blue Components**
   - **Interaction**: Certain sub-regions within input Blue components are consistently transformed to Dark Red in the output, while the remaining parts stay Blue. This affects all train inputs with multi-pixel Blue components (>1 pixel).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every train example. No input has Dark Red; all outputs introduce Dark Red derived from Blue areas. Small single-pixel Blues (p=1, h=0) show no color change or new Dark Red.
   - **Affected Properties**: Color (Blue → Dark Red for subsets of pixels). No reverse (Dark Red → Blue) occurs.
   - **Unknown**: Exact rule for which pixels change color (e.g., not consistently tied to holes alone, as hole-less large Blues in train input 1 still produce Dark Red).

#### 2. **Position (BBox) of Input Blue Influences Position (BBox) of Output Dark Red**
   - **Interaction**: Output Dark Red bounding boxes ([x1,y1,x2,y2]) are always spatially contained within or directly overlapping the bounding boxes of input Blue components. No Dark Red appears outside the union of input Blue bboxes.
   - **Consistency**: Holds across all three train examples. Examples:
     - Train 1: All Dark Red bboxes (e.g., [2,0,4,1], [4,9,7,12]) overlap input Blues like [0,0,16,4] or [0,9,16,14].
     - Train 2: Dark Red (e.g., [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14]) within [6,5,11,9] or [0,0,15,15].
     - Train 3: Both Dark Red ([9,5,12,8], [6,11,8,13]) fully within [4,3,13,12].
   - **Affected Properties**: Position (input Blue bbox → output Dark Red bbox containment/overlap). Output Blue bboxes often shrink slightly or shift minimally relative to inputs (e.g., y-ranges adjust by 1 unit).
   - **Unknown**: Precise positional transformation rule (e.g., why some Dark Red shift rightward or downward consistently, like in train 1 and 2, but not explainable without visuals).

#### 3. **Pixel Count of Input Blue Affects Pixel Count of Output Blue and Dark Red**
   - **Interaction**: For input Blue components with >10 pixels, the output Blue pixel count in overlapping regions decreases, with the "lost" pixels approximately appearing in co-located Dark Red components (suggesting pixel reallocation). Total pixels (Blue + Dark Red) in outputs roughly match input Blue totals (within ~5-8 pixels, possibly due to unaccounted overlaps).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train example for large/multi-pixel Blues:
     - Train 1: Input Blues total ~200 pixels → output Blue ~165 + Dark Red 38 (total ~203, minor discrepancy).
     - Train 2: Input ~194 → output Blue 160 + Dark Red 32 (total 192).
     - Train 3: Input 90 → output Blue 70 + Dark Red 20 (exact 90).
     - Small p=1 inputs show no pixel loss or gain.
   - **Affected Properties**: Pixels (input Blue pixels → reduction in output Blue + addition to output Dark Red, tied to spatial overlap from #2).
   - **Unknown**: Exact allocation mechanism (discrepancies like train 1's ~3 extra total pixels can't be explained; not consistently 1:1 subtraction per component).

#### 4. **Holes in Input Blue Influence Holes in Output Dark Red**
   - **Interaction**: Input Blue components with holes (>0) produce output Dark Red components that inherit or derive similar hole counts (e.g., input h=1 or 2 leads to Dark Red h=1 or 2). Output Blue hole counts often decrease (e.g., by 1) in the same regions.
   - **Consistency**: Applies in all three train examples for holed inputs (hole-less small components unaffected):
     - Train 1: Input h=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → Dark Red h=1 (two instances); output Blue h=0 in that region.
     - Train 2: Input h=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → Dark Red h=1 (two); input h=3 ([0,0,15,15]) → Dark Red h=1 (one) and h=0 (one); output Blues h=1 (unchanged for small, reduced for large).
     - Train 3: Input h=2 → Dark Red h=2 (one) and h=1 (one); output Blue h=1 (reduced by 1).
   - **Affected Properties**: Holes (input Blue holes → output Dark Red holes as subsets/similars; input Blue holes → reduction in output Blue holes).
   - **Unknown**: How hole count is specifically derived or split (e.g., why h=3 in train 2 yields mostly h=1 Dark Red, not a direct match; no clear position-holes link beyond general containment).

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections identifiable from the property data across all train examples. No other properties (e.g., exact bbox dimensions, color beyond Blue/Dark Red) show reliable interactions in every case. Test inputs were not analyzed for connections, as the task focuses on train data for consistency.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 20:35:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for shape parts) to identify and mark "enclosed" or "vulnerable" regions within shapes using 7s, likely simulating rules for collapsing or highlighting holes, dangling edges, and boundary exposures in a 2D structure like a cave or blob. The goal is to apply iterative rules for pruning loose ends, detecting closed/open holes, and propagating marks to adjacent cells, ultimately transforming the grid to match expected patterns where 7s fill internal voids or exposed areas without altering the overall shape topology.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling parts) by setting them to 0 if they have fewer than 2 orthogonal neighbors that are 1s, but only after initial passes to avoid over-pruning connected structures.
 * Detect closed holes: A 0 cell fully surrounded by 4 adjacent 1s marks those neighbors as 7s, indicating an enclosed void that "traps" or highlights the boundary.
 * Propagate 7s: Any 1 adjacent to a 7 becomes 7, but this should be iterative and applied after initial marking to fill entire enclosed regions without leaking to open areas.
 * Handle open boundaries: For top-row 0s between two 1s with a 1 below, mark adjacent 1s as 7s (simulating exposure at the top edge); similarly for right-edge 0s with vertical and left neighbors as 1s.
 * Subtle edge cases: Propagation must not cross open holes (e.g., 0s on boundaries shouldn't trigger full fills); multiple iterations may be needed for propagation, but single passes in the code lead to incomplete fills; dangling prune should happen first but not remove parts that later connect via propagation.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x19 in ex1, 16x16 in ex2, 16x16 in ex3), with empty rows/columns; ignore all-0 areas; 7s should only appear in 1-regions that form loops or exposures, not isolated 1s.
 * Order matters: Pruning before hole detection prevents false positives; propagation last to avoid marking open areas; open-top/right rules seem specific to boundary exposures but miss bottom/left symmetries or diagonal considerations (though rules appear orthogonal-only).
 * No diagonals in neighbor counts; only up/down/left/right; 7s don't count as neighbors for pruning or hole detection (they're marked 1s effectively for connectivity but flagged for removal/fill).
 * Potential for multi-step: Some expected 7s form blobs (e.g., vertical/horizontal fills in ex1 bottom and ex3), suggesting flood-fill-like behavior from seeds like closed holes or open edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def prune_dangling(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # This function works partially: correctly identifies low-connectivity 1s (<2 neighbors) and sets to 0.
    # Useful for initial cleanup, but in ex1 it didn't prune enough in lower areas, and in ex3 it over-applied without considering later propagation.
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                continue
            n = 0
            if i > 0 and new_g[i - 1][j] == 1:
                n += 1
            if i < rows - 1 and new_g[i + 1][j] == 1:
                n += 1

    return new_g
```

```python

def set_adjacent_to_open_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken/incomplete: Only checks top row for specific pattern (0 between two 1s with 1 below), but misses general top exposures or iterations; in ex1, it marked some but not the full top-left hole; doesn't handle non-top rows or left/right symmetries.
    # Not helpful as-is; over-specific and doesn't propagate.

def set_adjacent_to_open_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar issue: Only right edge, partial pattern match, misses bottom/left; in ex2/ex3, no right exposures triggered correctly, leading to missing 7s (e.g., ex2 row0-1 col14-15).
    # Broken for asymmetric boundaries; expand to all edges or generalize to any boundary 0 with 3 neighbors.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage: ex1 generated scattered 7s in top but missed major fills in rows 4-6 col7-10 (expected blob of 7s around hole) and bottom shapes (e.g., row10-13 col5-7 all 7s); also left dangling 0s unfilled.
 * Ex2: Generated extra 7s in row4 col14 and incomplete fills (e.g., row7 col9=0 instead of 7, row8 col13=7 but expected 1); missed top-right exposure (row0-1 col14-15 as 7s) and bottom fills (row12-14 col5-9).
 * Ex3: Over-pruned or under-marked central shape; generated 7s in row5-8 col9-12 but missed expected hole fills (e.g., row6 col10=0 should be 7-bound, row12 col6-8=7s); bottom row13 all 0s instead of partial 7s.
 * Prune_dangling worked for some isolations but applied too early/late, removing parts needed for connectivity (e.g., ex1 row2 col16=0 correct, but affected propagation).
 * Closed_holes detected some internals (e.g., ex2 row6-9 col7-10) but didn't chain with propagation, leaving partial 7s (e.g., ex1 row4 col3=1 instead of 1 but surrounded).
 * Propagation single-pass failed long chains (e.g., ex1 vertical 7s in col15-16 incomplete; ex3 row11-12 col6-8 missed spread).
 * Open_top/right functions triggered minimally (e.g., ex1 top marked some but not the irregular hole at row0-2 col2-4); ignored other edges, missing ex3 bottom exposures.
 * Order in program() (prune -> open_top -> open_right -> closed_holes -> propagate) logical but insufficient iterations; no handling for multiple holes per shape or boundary vs. internal distinction.
 * No object extraction, leading to global rules missing per-blob contexts (e.g., ex1 has multiple shapes, but rules didn't isolate them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly prunes top rows to 0s where isolated, marks a central blob of 7s in rows4-9 col4-7 (simulating a hole fill), and leaves boundaries as 1s, which aligns with a single large shape with internal exposure.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Missing propagation to full enclosed regions (e.g., row4 col5-7 should likely fill more horizontally/vertically like ex1's bottom blob, but stops abruptly); top-left 1s remain unmarked despite potential open-top exposure (row0-3 col0-4 all 1s, but expected 7s if dangling or open); right side row9-11 col12-13=1 but may need 7s if exposed; bottom rows13-15 all 1s in col0-4 but 0s elsewhere—likely under-pruned, as ex3 showed need for bottom fills; overall, 7s form a partial "cave" but don't match expected symmetry (e.g., no 7s in row10-11 col0-4, which looks like an open bottom needing marks).
 * Compared to training, it over-relies on central hole detection but misses edge rules (no top/right triggers visible), leading to incomplete 7-blobs; if correct output should mirror ex1's multi-shape fills, this test needs more iterative propagation and symmetric edge handling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (possibly a variant of enclosure or loop puzzles like Slitherlink or area-claiming games) where the input grid consists of 1s (solid elements like walls or lines) and 0s (empty spaces or holes), and the goal is to output a modified grid that prunes invalid or dangling structures, identifies enclosed or partially open regions, and marks boundaries or closures with 7s to highlight valid enclosures while leaving unsolved or open areas as 0 or 1.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune "dangling" 1s that have fewer than 2 adjacent 1s ( orthogonally: up, down, left, right), as they don't form stable structures; this removes isolated or weakly connected lines but should not affect core loops or enclosures.
 * Identify closed holes (0s fully surrounded by 4 adjacent 1s) and mark their adjacent 1s as 7s to indicate enclosure boundaries; subtle: this only applies to fully enclosed 0s, not partial ones.
 * Mark open edges of potential enclosures: for top row, detect 0s between two 1s and mark surrounding 1s and below cells as 7s; for right column, similar for vertical opens; for bottom, reverse top logic; subtle: these handle boundary openings but must avoid over-marking internal structures.
 * Propagate markings horizontally: if a 1 is adjacent to a 7, mark it as 7 to extend boundary detection, but only one step at a time and only horizontally in this implementation; subtle: may need vertical or multi-directional propagation, and limiting to horizontal misses vertical chains.
 * Overall process order matters: prune first, then mark opens, then closed holes, then propagate; repeating propagation helps but may not suffice for complex shapes.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16 in examples), with empty rows/columns; ignore edges if out-of-bounds.
 * 7s seem to represent "claimed" or "boundary" cells, but do not overwrite 0s—only modify 1s to 7s.
 * Subtle elements: Open markings assume specific patterns (e.g., 0 between two 1s on edge), but may miss diagonal considerations or multi-cell opens; propagation is incomplete, leading to partial chains; dangling prune is correct but interacts poorly with later markings if not iterated.
 * No diagonal adjacency considered—only orthogonal.
 * Empty areas (all 0s) should remain 0s; solid lines of 1s may need partial marking if they form enclosure edges.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic gaps in enclosure detection and propagation.
 * Training example 1: Generated over-marked top-left enclosure (e.g., row 0: [1,7,7,0,7,7,7,...] vs expected [1,1,7,0,7,1,1,...]) and bottom (row 17 missing some 0s/7s); missed partial opens in mid-section (row 10-12 expected more 0s inside); propagation didn't fill vertical chains properly; prune_dangling worked but open marking over-applied 7s horizontally.
 * Training example 1 subtle: Row 11 expected [1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7,1,...] but generated all 7s in middle, suggesting faulty bottom-open detection filling too much.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrect right-edge markings (e.g., row 0 ends [...,1,0] vs expected [...,7,0]; row 6 [...,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,0,7]); missed internal hole patterns (row 7 expected [1,7,0,7,1,...] but generated [7,7,0,7,...]); propagation horizontal-only left vertical 1s unmarked; open_right over-marked without checking full open condition.
 * Training example 2 subtle: Bottom section (rows 12-15) generated solid 1s but expected partial 7s and 0s in a enclosure, indicating set_adjacent_to_closed_holes didn't trigger or was ordered wrong.
 * Training example 3: Generated incomplete mid-enclosure (row 6: [...,1,7,7,7,0,7,...] vs expected [...,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,...]); bottom (row 12) marked too few 7s ([...,7,7,7,0,7,...] vs expected [...,1,1,7,0,7,...]); missed vertical propagation in left structure; mark_open_bottom applied incorrectly, filling from top-down instead of bottom-up.
 * Training example 3 subtle: Upper enclosure (rows 5-9) expected asymmetric 7s around 0s but generated symmetric overfill, likely from horizontal propagation ignoring shape.
 * Overall: Functions like prune_dangling and set_adjacent_to_closed_holes are helpful and mostly correct but need better integration; mark_open_top/right/bottom are broken (wrong cell targeting, e.g., bottom marks below instead of above); propagate_horizontal_one_step is unhelpful as-is (too limited, misses vertical/directional needs—don't reuse without expansion); no iteration on prune or full flood-fill leads to partial results.
 * Pipeline order issue: Marking opens before closed holes causes premature 7s to interfere; limited propagation (only twice, horizontal) fails complex shapes.
 * No handling for multi-cell holes or open enclosures that aren't single 0s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-marks several enclosures and misses nuanced partial opens/closures, similar to training failures.
 * Top-left (rows 0-2) all 1s except edges, but likely should have some 7s on open top if pattern matches training (e.g., expected partial 7s like in train1 row0); generated keeps too many 1s.
 * Mid-enclosure (rows 3-5): Generated [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,0,7,7,0,0] for row3, but expected might preserve more 1s around the 0 (like train3's asymmetric); over-propagated 7s rightward.
 * Central structure (rows 6-9): Heavy 7-marking (e.g., row7 all 7s in middle) vs likely expected mix of 1s/0s/7s for open hole (similar to train2 row7 [1,7,0,7,...]); misses internal 0 preservation.
 * Bottom (rows 11-13): Row11 [1,1,1,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,1,...] overfills vs expected possible [1,1,1,1,7,0,7,...] like train1; row12 has trailing 0s but generated [1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,...], suggesting incomplete right-open handling.
 * Overall, test output shows same issues as training: excessive horizontal 7-propagation, incorrect open-edge marking (e.g., right column has dangling 0s unmarked), and failure to detect subtle enclosure shapes; does not make sense for a valid solution as it creates overly filled regions without respecting open 0s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty space, 1s for filled/shape pixels) where the goal is to identify and mark specific "notch" or indentation patterns on the boundaries of enclosed or semi-enclosed shapes using 7s, while pruning dangling or isolated 1s. The process simulates edge detection or boundary refinement, focusing on horizontal and vertical notches that indicate corners or indents in puzzle pieces, with rules prioritizing enclosed structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling edges) first to clean up the grid before marking, using a neighbor count threshold of <2 to remove them, but ensure this doesn't affect valid boundary pixels.
 * Mark single horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-1 patterns in a row, but only if vertically enclosed (above or below is 1 or edge), then mark the flanking 1s and adjacent vertical neighbors as 7s; subtle: for open-below cases, check if the below cell has <2 neighbors to propagate marking downward.
 * Mark double horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-0-1 patterns, require vertical enclosure on both 0s, mark flanking 1s and nearby vertical segments; subtle: extend marking horizontally in the enclosing row to cover connected 1s within a small range (e.g., j-1 to j+3).
 * Mark vertical notches on edges: For left/right boundaries, detect 1-0 or 0-1 at column 0 or cols-1, mark the inner 1 and adjacent verticals if enclosed; subtle: vertical notches may need separate handling from horizontal ones to avoid overlap, and enclosure checks must include top/bottom edges.
 * All markings should preserve original 1s/0s but overlay 7s only on boundary 1s that form notches; avoid marking internal 1s or non-boundary areas.
 * Process in sequence: prune -> single notches -> double notches -> vertical notches, as later steps depend on cleaned grids.
 * Subtle enclosure: "Has enclosure" means at least one vertical side (above or below) has 1s covering the notch width; for open sides, use neighbor counts to infer loose enclosure.
 * Grids can have multiple disconnected shapes; markings are local to each.
 * No diagonal considerations in current rules, but future may need them for complex shapes.
 * Outputs use 7 to indicate marked boundaries, but 0s and unmarked 1s remain as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Propagating marks to adjacent cells in enclosing rows only if they are 1s; over-marking in open areas; failing to handle edge cases like notches at grid boundaries or multi-row indents.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 generated incorrect output: In row 16 (0-indexed), generated all 0s [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] but expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0], indicating failure to mark a horizontal notch or enclosure in the lower-right area; upper rows matched perfectly, suggesting the issue is with detecting distant or vertically open notches.
 * Training example 2 and 3 were correct, so core logic for single/double notches and pruning works for those shapes.
 * mark_single_notches partially works but misses propagation in some open-below cases, as seen in training 1's row 16 discrepancy.
 * mark_double_notches seems effective for wider indents but may not interact well with vertical marks.
 * mark_vertical_notches handles edges but likely incomplete for non-edge vertical indents; it only checks left/right columns, missing internal vertical notches.
 * Overall, the sequential processing works, but enclosure checks are too strict for bottom-open notches, leading to missed markings in training 1.
 * No extraction functions for objects/shapes were used or needed; the grid is processed in-place locally, so global object extraction isn't relevant (don't use it).
 * The count_1_neighbors function is helpful and correct for neighbor-based decisions.
 * prune_dangling is essential and working, as it cleans without affecting valid structures in correct examples.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows reasonable markings: e.g., 7s outlining what appear to be two main shapes (left blob and right structure with indents), with pruning likely removing the top-right empty areas; single/double notches marked horizontally in rows 3-12, and vertical on edges.
 * It looks mostly correct based on visual inspection—7s trace boundaries and indents without over-marking internals, and 0s remain in empty spaces; however, without the expected output, it's hard to confirm subtle misses like in training 1 (e.g., potential unmarked bottom enclosures in rows 12-15).
 * The output handles the test's complex shape (irregular blob on left, indented form on right) better than training 1's failure, suggesting improvements in propagation, but row 12 has [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] which might miss a vertical notch extension if the shape requires it.
 * No obvious errors like over-pruning or wrong 7 placements, but the all-0 trailing areas (columns 14-15) are correctly unpruned as they seem part of the input structure; if the test expects more 7s in bottom rows, the enclosure logic may still be the weak point.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on the provided train examples (all three pairs), I analyzed the components for obvious, direct interactions or effects between properties (e.g., position influencing position, pixel count affecting pixel count, holes influencing holes, color changes tied to spatial properties). Only interactions present in **every** train example are listed below. I focused on low-level properties like those specified (bbox/position, holes, pixels, color). No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving attempts were made. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel components with no changes) were excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., exact pixel subtraction doesn't hold perfectly across all due to minor discrepancies in totals, possibly from overlaps or unlisted merges) are noted as unknown where they can't be directly linked. No forced connections for semantic shapes, as they aren't identifiable from the data alone.

#### 1. **Color Transformation Linked to Input Blue Components**
   - **Interaction**: Certain sub-regions within input Blue components are consistently transformed to Dark Red in the output, while the remaining parts stay Blue. This affects all train inputs with multi-pixel Blue components (>1 pixel).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every train example. No input has Dark Red; all outputs introduce Dark Red derived from Blue areas. Small single-pixel Blues (p=1, h=0) show no color change or new Dark Red.
   - **Affected Properties**: Color (Blue → Dark Red for subsets of pixels). No reverse (Dark Red → Blue) occurs.
   - **Unknown**: Exact rule for which pixels change color (e.g., not consistently tied to holes alone, as hole-less large Blues in train input 1 still produce Dark Red).

#### 2. **Position (BBox) of Input Blue Influences Position (BBox) of Output Dark Red**
   - **Interaction**: Output Dark Red bounding boxes ([x1,y1,x2,y2]) are always spatially contained within or directly overlapping the bounding boxes of input Blue components. No Dark Red appears outside the union of input Blue bboxes.
   - **Consistency**: Holds across all three train examples. Examples:
     - Train 1: All Dark Red bboxes (e.g., [2,0,4,1], [4,9,7,12]) overlap input Blues like [0,0,16,4] or [0,9,16,14].
     - Train 2: Dark Red (e.g., [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14]) within [6,5,11,9] or [0,0,15,15].
     - Train 3: Both Dark Red ([9,5,12,8], [6,11,8,13]) fully within [4,3,13,12].
   - **Affected Properties**: Position (input Blue bbox → output Dark Red bbox containment/overlap). Output Blue bboxes often shrink slightly or shift minimally relative to inputs (e.g., y-ranges adjust by 1 unit).
   - **Unknown**: Precise positional transformation rule (e.g., why some Dark Red shift rightward or downward consistently, like in train 1 and 2, but not explainable without visuals).

#### 3. **Pixel Count of Input Blue Affects Pixel Count of Output Blue and Dark Red**
   - **Interaction**: For input Blue components with >10 pixels, the output Blue pixel count in overlapping regions decreases, with the "lost" pixels approximately appearing in co-located Dark Red components (suggesting pixel reallocation). Total pixels (Blue + Dark Red) in outputs roughly match input Blue totals (within ~5-8 pixels, possibly due to unaccounted overlaps).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every train example for large/multi-pixel Blues:
     - Train 1: Input Blues total ~200 pixels → output Blue ~165 + Dark Red 38 (total ~203, minor discrepancy).
     - Train 2: Input ~194 → output Blue 160 + Dark Red 32 (total 192).
     - Train 3: Input 90 → output Blue 70 + Dark Red 20 (exact 90).
     - Small p=1 inputs show no pixel loss or gain.
   - **Affected Properties**: Pixels (input Blue pixels → reduction in output Blue + addition to output Dark Red, tied to spatial overlap from #2).
   - **Unknown**: Exact allocation mechanism (discrepancies like train 1's ~3 extra total pixels can't be explained; not consistently 1:1 subtraction per component).

#### 4. **Holes in Input Blue Influence Holes in Output Dark Red**
   - **Interaction**: Input Blue components with holes (>0) produce output Dark Red components that inherit or derive similar hole counts (e.g., input h=1 or 2 leads to Dark Red h=1 or 2). Output Blue hole counts often decrease (e.g., by 1) in the same regions.
   - **Consistency**: Applies in all three train examples for holed inputs (hole-less small components unaffected):
     - Train 1: Input h=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → Dark Red h=1 (two instances); output Blue h=0 in that region.
     - Train 2: Input h=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → Dark Red h=1 (two); input h=3 ([0,0,15,15]) → Dark Red h=1 (one) and h=0 (one); output Blues h=1 (unchanged for small, reduced for large).
     - Train 3: Input h=2 → Dark Red h=2 (one) and h=1 (one); output Blue h=1 (reduced by 1).
   - **Affected Properties**: Holes (input Blue holes → output Dark Red holes as subsets/similars; input Blue holes → reduction in output Blue holes).
   - **Unknown**: How hole count is specifically derived or split (e.g., why h=3 in train 2 yields mostly h=1 Dark Red, not a direct match; no clear position-holes link beyond general containment).

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections identifiable from the property data across all train examples. No other properties (e.g., exact bbox dimensions, color beyond Blue/Dark Red) show reliable interactions in every case. Test inputs were not analyzed for connections, as the task focuses on train data for consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Execution error: list index out of range

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: list index out of range
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 20:47:21] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled elements like lines or shapes) to simulate rules for pruning isolated or weakly connected 1s and marking specific "notch" patterns (gaps in lines) with 7s, likely to highlight structural features or invalidates in a visual diagram, such as architectural or circuit-like drawings. The goal is to apply these transformations iteratively or in sequence to match expected outputs where 7s indicate detected notches, extensions, or prunings without altering the core structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune 1s that are dangling (have fewer than 2 neighboring 1s in cardinal directions), but only after checking the entire grid to avoid over-pruning in one pass—subtlety: this must be done in a copy of the grid to prevent chain reactions in a single iteration.
 * Mark single notches: horizontal gaps of exactly one 0 between two 1s in a row (e.g., 1 0 1), marking the adjacent 1s as 7s if supported vertically (above/below 1s or at grid edge); extend marking to vertical supports and propagate to open spaces below/above if they are weakly connected (fewer than 2 neighbors).
 * Mark double notches: horizontal gaps of two 0s between 1s (e.g., 1 0 0 1), marking the bookending 1s and vertical supports as 7s if vertically supported; extend horizontally along vertical rows above/below and propagate to open double gaps below.
 * Mark vertical notches: gaps of one 0 vertically on left/right edges between two 1s (e.g., vertical 1 0 1 on column 0 or last column), marking the adjacent 1s and propagating horizontally to the inner adjacent column.
 * Subtle elements: Vertical support check must include grid edges as implicit support; propagation to open spaces only if they have <2 neighbors and are directly below/above the notch; no marking if no vertical support; horizontal extensions in vertical rows should cover the notch span plus adjacent; avoid over-marking by using grid copy and not re-processing marked cells; edges (top/bottom/left/right) need special handling to prevent index errors.
 * General: Process in order (prune first, then notches); 7s seem to "infect" or highlight without removing 1s; empty rows/columns (all 0s) should remain unchanged; subtle: notches on bottom/top edges may need symmetric handling, but code focuses on sides; no diagonal neighbors considered—only cardinal.
 * Bugs to avoid: Loop ranges must not exceed grid bounds (e.g., for double notches starting at j=2 to cols-3, not cols-1); accessing j+2 or i+/-1 without bounds checks causes index errors; use original g for neighbor counts, new_g for modifications.
 * Across attempts: No extraction of objects needed—direct grid mutation; consider multiple passes if notches create new danglers, but current code is single-pass per function.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def count_1_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    n = 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni = i + di
        nj = j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and g[ni][nj] == 1:
            n += 1
    return n
```
(This neighbor count is helpful and correct for pruning/weak connections; use it consistently with original g to avoid self-modification errors.)

```python
def prune_dangling(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                continue
            n = count_1_neighbors(new_g, i, j)  # Note: should use g here to avoid premature pruning
            if n < 2:
                new_g[i][j] = 0
    return new_g
```
(This is mostly helpful for initial cleanup but has a subtlety: counting on new_g can prune too aggressively in one pass; better to count on original g.)

(No object extraction functions are present or needed; the puzzle is grid-pattern based, not object-oriented.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented pruning and notch marking but failed all training examples and crashed on others due to index out of range errors (e.g., in mark_double_notches, j up to cols-1 but accessing j+2 without proper range limit to cols-3; similar in propagation loops).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated misses 7s in row1 cols2-4 (has 1,1,1,7,1 vs expected 1,1,7,7,7), row3 cols7-9 (has 1,1,7,1 vs 7,7,7), row9 cols5-7 (has 1,1,7,1 vs 1,7,7,7), row17 col13 (has 1 vs 7), row18 cols13-15 (has 1,1,7,7,7,1 vs 1,7,7,7,1—wait, expected has 7,7,7,1 but generated not shown fully); extra/missing in vertical propagations and edge handling; unknown why single notch in row4 col8 (0) didn't propagate correctly to match expected 7s around it.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has incorrect top rows (row0 ends 1,0 vs expected 7,0; row1 ends 1,1 vs 7,7); misses 7s in row5 cols13-15 (1,7,1 vs 7,7,7), row6 cols7-9 (1,1,7 vs 7,7,7), row7 cols13 (0 vs 7? wait, 0,7,7,7 but expected 0,7,7,7—minor), row8 cols7-9 (1,7,7 vs 7,7,7) and ends 1,7,0 vs 1,7,0 (match but context wrong); over-marks or misses double notch propagations in lower sections; top-right corner not handled as notch.
 * Crashes on Train 3 and Test: Due to unbound loops (e.g., j=cols-1 in double_notches accessing j+2); no empty grid handling or variable size checks; suggests program assumes fixed 17x16 but inputs vary.
 * Function mark_single_notches is partially helpful but buggy: vertical support sets has_vertical=True too loosely (e.g., edge check always True even without vertical 1s?); propagation only if <2 neighbors but uses g instead of new_g inconsistently; misses symmetric top/bottom fully.
 * Function mark_double_notches is broken/not helpful: range(2, cols-1) too loose (should be to cols-3); has_vertical loop over k=[0,1] but sets for jj=j+k without checking support per gap; extend horizontally uses max(0,j-1) to min(cols,j+3) but risks index error if j near edge; open_below assumes two 0s but propagates three-wide without neighbor check.
 * Function mark_vertical_notches is somewhat helpful for edges but incomplete: only handles left/right vertical gaps, not top/bottom; propagation to adjacent inner column uses for di in [-1,0,1] but ii=i+di without full bounds; misses if gap is at i=0 or i=rows-1.
 * Overall: Good structure with new_g copies and ordered processing, but lacks bounds safety, full symmetry (top/bottom notches), and precise vertical support logic; no iteration for chained effects; prune_dangling works conceptually but may need original g for counts.

**Test output:**
 * No valid generated output for test input—crashes with list index out of range, so cannot assess correctness; this indicates the program is unusable for variable or edge-case grids (e.g., smaller sizes, notches near bounds).
 * Based on errors, test likely has notches or patterns near grid edges (e.g., j near cols-1 in double_notches or i near 0/rows-1 in vertical), causing overreach; expected output probably requires safe bounds and full edge handling, including top/bottom horizontal notches not implemented.
 * Without running, hard to mentally simulate test grid (not provided), but if similar to trains, output should have 7s filling notch supports and propagations without crashes; current errors mean it doesn't make sense or handle real inputs.

This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the 3 train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, pixels, position/bbox) where one element clearly affects or relates to another in a repeatable way. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., overall grid size, isolated background without changes) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., exact pixel offsets or directional movements) are not included. Specific transformation rules (e.g., how a hole "moves" precisely) are called out as unknown where no clear, consistent link exists beyond the noted interactions.

1. **Color transformation between Blue and Dark Red**:
   - Input Blue regions (all examples consist exclusively of Blue) interact with output by partial recoloring: Some pixels from input Blue regions are transformed into Dark Red regions in the output.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains. Blue pixel counts decrease in output by an amount approximately or exactly matching the total pixels added in Dark Red regions (e.g., Train 1: Blue decreases by ~35, Dark Red adds ~38; Train 3: exact match at 20 pixels transformed). This implies a direct pixel-level interaction where Blue loses area to create Dark Red.

2. **Spatial position (bbox) containment**:
   - Input Blue region bboxes directly constrain output Dark Red region positions: All Dark Red regions in the output are fully contained within the bbox of one or more input Blue regions.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains. No Dark Red appears outside input Blue bboxes (e.g., Train 1: All 5 Dark Red bboxes nested in input [0,0-16,4], [0,9-16,14], [0,17-16,18]; Train 2: All 4 Dark Red in [6,5-11,9] or [0,0-15,15]; Train 3: Both Dark Red in [4,3-13,12]). This suggests input position bounds affect where transformations occur, preventing external placements.

3. **Hole count interaction between Blue and Dark Red**:
   - Input Blue hole counts (>0) affect output Dark Red hole counts: Blue regions with holes >0 in input lead to the creation of at least one Dark Red region with holes >0 in the output, within the same or overlapping bbox.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains. Input h>0 Blues always produce h>0 Dark Red nearby (e.g., Train 1: input h=1 at [0,9-16,14] → two h=1 Dark Red inside; Train 2: input h=1 at [6,5-11,9] and h=3 at [0,0-15,15] → three h=1 Dark Red inside/adjacent; Train 3: input h=2 at [4,3-13,12] → h=2 and h=1 Dark Red inside). Input h=0 Blues can produce h=0 Dark Red, but h>0 inputs never produce only h=0 Dark Red. Output Blue holes are often reduced compared to input (e.g., h=2 → h=1), suggesting holes are partially "transferred" or interacted with during color transformation.
   - Unknown: Exact mechanism of hole count modification (e.g., splitting, combining, or filling) is not consistently explainable; totals do not always conserve (e.g., Train 1 input total h=1 → output Dark Red total h=3).

4. **Small 1-pixel Blue regions (position and size) affecting edge/nearby Dark Red placement**:
   - Input small Blue regions (holes=0, pixels=1, single-point bbox) interact positionally with output Dark Red regions: These small Blues are consistently located near edges or boundaries of larger input Blues, and their positions correlate with the placement of at least one small or edge-adjacent Dark Red region (h=0 or h=1, pixels <15) in the output.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains, where every input has 1-2 such small Blues, and outputs have corresponding small/edge Dark Red near their input positions (e.g., Train 1: input 1px at [13,7] near right edge → output h=0 Dark Red at [15,1-16,3] right edge; input 1px at [3,15] near left bottom → output h=0 Dark Red at [2,0-4,1] left edge; Train 2: input 1px at [4,8] left-middle → output h=1 Dark Red at [5,12-8,14] nearby left-bottom; Train 3: input 1px at [15,4] right → output h=2 Dark Red at [9,5-12,8] rightish; input 1px at [1,14] left-bottom → output h=1 Dark Red at [6,11-8,13] left-bottom). These small Blues disappear in output (no 1px Blues remain), implying they initiate or seed nearby Dark Red creation.
   - Unknown: Precise positional transformation (e.g., exact x/y offset or direction from input 1px to output Dark Red) is not consistently identifiable; correlations are proximate but vary in distance/orientation.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable link between input pixels and output hole sizes, or between non-small Blue positions and specific Dark Red shapes). Elements like horizontal bars or silhouettes from the initial description do not appear consistently in the data.

[2025-09-30 20:49:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for shape parts) to identify and mark "enclosed" or "vulnerable" regions within shapes using 7s, likely simulating rules for collapsing or highlighting holes, dangling edges, and boundary exposures in a 2D structure like a cave or blob. The goal is to apply iterative rules for pruning loose ends, detecting closed/open holes, and propagating marks to adjacent cells, ultimately transforming the grid to match expected patterns where 7s fill internal voids or exposed areas without altering the overall shape topology.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling parts) by setting them to 0 if they have fewer than 2 orthogonal neighbors that are 1s, but only after initial passes to avoid over-pruning connected structures.
 * Detect closed holes: A 0 cell fully surrounded by 4 adjacent 1s marks those neighbors as 7s, indicating an enclosed void that "traps" or highlights the boundary.
 * Propagate 7s: Any 1 adjacent to a 7 becomes 7, but this should be iterative and applied after initial marking to fill entire enclosed regions without leaking to open areas.
 * Handle open boundaries: For top-row 0s between two 1s with a 1 below, mark adjacent 1s as 7s (simulating exposure at the top edge); similarly for right-edge 0s with vertical and left neighbors as 1s.
 * Subtle edge cases: Propagation must not cross open holes (e.g., 0s on boundaries shouldn't trigger full fills); multiple iterations may be needed for propagation, but single passes in the code lead to incomplete fills; dangling prune should happen first but not remove parts that later connect via propagation.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x19 in ex1, 16x16 in ex2, 16x16 in ex3), with empty rows/columns; ignore all-0 areas; 7s should only appear in 1-regions that form loops or exposures, not isolated 1s.
 * Order matters: Pruning before hole detection prevents false positives; propagation last to avoid marking open areas; open-top/right rules seem specific to boundary exposures but miss bottom/left symmetries or diagonal considerations (though rules appear orthogonal-only).
 * No diagonals in neighbor counts; only up/down/left/right; 7s don't count as neighbors for pruning or hole detection (they're marked 1s effectively for connectivity but flagged for removal/fill).
 * Potential for multi-step: Some expected 7s form blobs (e.g., vertical/horizontal fills in ex1 bottom and ex3), suggesting flood-fill-like behavior from seeds like closed holes or open edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def prune_dangling(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # This function works partially: correctly identifies low-connectivity 1s (<2 neighbors) and sets to 0.

def set_adjacent_to_open_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken/incomplete: Only checks top row for specific pattern (0 between two 1s with 1 below), but misses general top exposures or iterations; in ex1, it marked some but not the full top-left hole; doesn't handle non-top rows or left/right symmetries.
    # Not helpful as-is; over-specific and doesn't propagate.

def set_adjacent_to_open_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar issue: Only right edge, partial pattern match, misses bottom/left; in ex2/ex3, no right exposures triggered correctly, leading to missing 7s (e.g., ex2 row0-1 col14-15).
    # Broken for asymmetric boundaries; expand to all edges or generalize to any boundary 0 with 3 neighbors.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage: ex1 generated scattered 7s in top but missed major fills in rows 4-6 col7-10 (expected blob of 7s around hole) and bottom shapes (e.g., row10-13 col5-7 all 7s); also left dangling 0s unfilled.
 * Ex2: Generated extra 7s in row4 col14 and incomplete fills (e.g., row7 col9=0 instead of 7, row8 col13=7 but expected 1); missed top-right exposure (row0-1 col14-15 as 7s) and bottom fills (row12-14 col5-9).
 * Ex3: Over-pruned or under-marked central shape; generated 7s in row5-8 col9-12 but missed expected hole fills (e.g., row6 col10=0 should be 7-bound, row12 col6-8=7s); bottom row13 all 0s instead of partial 7s.
 * Prune_dangling worked for some isolations but applied too early/late, removing parts needed for connectivity (e.g., ex1 row2 col16=0 correct, but affected propagation).
 * Closed_holes detected some internals (e.g., ex2 row6-9 col7-10) but didn't chain with propagation, leaving partial 7s (e.g., ex1 row4 col3=1 instead of 1 but surrounded).
 * Propagation single-pass failed long chains (e.g., ex1 vertical 7s in col15-16 incomplete; ex3 row11-12 col6-8 missed spread).
 * Open_top/right functions triggered minimally (e.g., ex1 top marked some but not the irregular hole at row0-2 col2-4); ignored other edges, missing ex3 bottom exposures.
 * Order in program() (prune -> open_top -> open_right -> closed_holes -> propagate) logical but insufficient iterations; no handling for multiple holes per shape or boundary vs. internal distinction.
 * No object extraction, leading to global rules missing per-blob contexts (e.g., ex1 has multiple shapes, but rules didn't isolate them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly prunes top rows to 0s where isolated, marks a central blob of 7s in rows4-9 col4-7 (simulating a hole fill), and leaves boundaries as 1s, which aligns with a single large shape with internal exposure.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Missing propagation to full enclosed regions (e.g., row4 col5-7 should likely fill more horizontally/vertically like ex1's bottom blob, but stops abruptly); top-left 1s remain unmarked despite potential open-top exposure (row0-3 col0-4 all 1s, but expected 7s if dangling or open); right side row9-11 col12-13=1 but may need 7s if exposed; bottom rows13-15 all 1s in col0-4 but 0s elsewhere—likely under-pruned, as ex3 showed need for bottom fills; overall, 7s form a partial "cave" but don't match expected symmetry (e.g., no 7s in row10-11 col0-4, which looks like an open bottom needing marks).
 * Compared to training, it over-relies on central hole detection but misses edge rules (no top/right triggers visible), leading to incomplete 7-blobs; if correct output should mirror ex1's multi-shape fills, this test needs more iterative propagation and symmetric edge handling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (possibly a variant of enclosure or loop puzzles like Slitherlink or area-claiming games) where the input grid consists of 1s (solid elements like walls or lines) and 0s (empty spaces or holes), and the goal is to output a modified grid that prunes invalid or dangling structures, identifies enclosed or partially open regions, and marks boundaries or closures with 7s to highlight valid enclosures while leaving unsolved or open areas as 0 or 1.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune "dangling" 1s that have fewer than 2 adjacent 1s ( orthogonally: up, down, left, right), as they don't form stable structures; this removes isolated or weakly connected lines but should not affect core loops or enclosures.
 * Identify closed holes (0s fully surrounded by 4 adjacent 1s) and mark their adjacent 1s as 7s to indicate enclosure boundaries; subtle: this only applies to fully enclosed 0s, not partial ones.
 * Mark open edges of potential enclosures: for top row, detect 0s between two 1s and mark surrounding 1s and below cells as 7s; for right column, similar for vertical opens; for bottom, reverse top logic; subtle: these handle boundary openings but must avoid over-marking internal structures.
 * Propagate markings horizontally: if a 1 is adjacent to a 7, mark it as 7 to extend boundary detection, but only one step at a time and only horizontally in this implementation; subtle: may need vertical or multi-directional propagation, and limiting to horizontal misses vertical chains.
 * Overall process order matters: prune first, then mark opens, then closed holes, then propagate; repeating propagation helps but may not suffice for complex shapes.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16 in examples), with empty rows/columns; ignore edges if out-of-bounds.
 * 7s seem to represent "claimed" or "boundary" cells, but do not overwrite 0s—only modify 1s to 7s.
 * Subtle elements: Open markings assume specific patterns (e.g., 0 between two 1s on edge), but may miss diagonal considerations or multi-cell opens; propagation is incomplete, leading to partial chains; dangling prune is correct but interacts poorly with later markings if not iterated.
 * No diagonal adjacency considered—only orthogonal.
 * Empty areas (all 0s) should remain 0s; solid lines of 1s may need partial marking if they form enclosure edges.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic gaps in enclosure detection and propagation.
 * Training example 1: Generated over-marked top-left enclosure (e.g., row 0: [1,7,7,0,7,7,7,...] vs expected [1,1,7,0,7,1,1,...]) and bottom (row 17 missing some 0s/7s); missed partial opens in mid-section (row 10-12 expected more 0s inside); propagation didn't fill vertical chains properly; prune_dangling worked but open marking over-applied 7s horizontally.
 * Training example 1 subtle: Row 11 expected [1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7,1,...] but generated all 7s in middle, suggesting faulty bottom-open detection filling too much.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrect right-edge markings (e.g., row 0 ends [...,1,0] vs expected [...,7,0]; row 6 [...,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,0,7]); missed internal hole patterns (row 7 expected [1,7,0,7,1,...] but generated [7,7,0,7,...]); propagation horizontal-only left vertical 1s unmarked; open_right over-marked without checking full open condition.
 * Training example 2 subtle: Bottom section (rows 12-15) generated solid 1s but expected partial 7s and 0s in a enclosure, indicating set_adjacent_to_closed_holes didn't trigger or was ordered wrong.
 * Training example 3: Generated incomplete mid-enclosure (row 6: [...,1,7,7,7,0,7,...] vs expected [...,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,...]); bottom (row 12) marked too few 7s ([...,7,7,7,0,7,...] vs expected [...,1,1,7,0,7,...]); missed vertical propagation in left structure; mark_open_bottom applied incorrectly, filling from top-down instead of bottom-up.
 * Training example 3 subtle: Upper enclosure (rows 5-9) expected asymmetric 7s around 0s but generated symmetric overfill, likely from horizontal propagation ignoring shape.
 * Overall: Functions like prune_dangling and set_adjacent_to_closed_holes are helpful and mostly correct but need better integration; mark_open_top/right/bottom are broken (wrong cell targeting, e.g., bottom marks below instead of above); propagate_horizontal_one_step is unhelpful as-is (too limited, misses vertical/directional needs—don't reuse without expansion); no iteration on prune or full flood-fill leads to partial results.
 * Pipeline order issue: Marking opens before closed holes causes premature 7s to interfere; limited propagation (only twice, horizontal) fails complex shapes.
 * No handling for multi-cell holes or open enclosures that aren't single 0s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-marks several enclosures and misses nuanced partial opens/closures, similar to training failures.
 * Top-left (rows 0-2) all 1s except edges, but likely should have some 7s on open top if pattern matches training (e.g., expected partial 7s like in train1 row0); generated keeps too many 1s.
 * Mid-enclosure (rows 3-5): Generated [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,0,7,7,0,0] for row3, but expected might preserve more 1s around the 0 (like train3's asymmetric); over-propagated 7s rightward.
 * Central structure (rows 6-9): Heavy 7-marking (e.g., row7 all 7s in middle) vs likely expected mix of 1s/0s/7s for open hole (similar to train2 row7 [1,7,0,7,...]); misses internal 0 preservation.
 * Bottom (rows 11-13): Row11 [1,1,1,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,1,...] overfills vs expected possible [1,1,1,1,7,0,7,...] like train1; row12 has trailing 0s but generated [1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,...], suggesting incomplete right-open handling.
 * Overall, test output shows same issues as training: excessive horizontal 7-propagation, incorrect open-edge marking (e.g., right column has dangling 0s unmarked), and failure to detect subtle enclosure shapes; does not make sense for a valid solution as it creates overly filled regions without respecting open 0s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled elements like lines or shapes) to simulate rules for pruning isolated or weakly connected 1s and marking specific "notch" patterns (gaps in lines) with 7s, likely to highlight structural features or invalidates in a visual diagram, such as architectural or circuit-like drawings. The goal is to apply these transformations iteratively or in sequence to match expected outputs where 7s indicate detected notches, extensions, or prunings without altering the core structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune 1s that are dangling (have fewer than 2 neighboring 1s in cardinal directions), but only after checking the entire grid to avoid over-pruning in one pass—subtlety: this must be done in a copy of the grid to prevent chain reactions in a single iteration.
 * Mark single notches: horizontal gaps of exactly one 0 between two 1s in a row (e.g., 1 0 1), marking the adjacent 1s as 7s if supported vertically (above/below 1s or at grid edge); extend marking to vertical supports and propagate to open spaces below/above if they are weakly connected (fewer than 2 neighbors).
 * Mark double notches: horizontal gaps of two 0s between 1s (e.g., 1 0 0 1), marking the bookending 1s and vertical supports as 7s if vertically supported; extend horizontally along vertical rows above/below and propagate to open double gaps below.
 * Mark vertical notches: gaps of one 0 vertically on left/right edges between two 1s (e.g., vertical 1 0 1 on column 0 or last column), marking the adjacent 1s and propagating horizontally to the inner adjacent column.
 * Subtle elements: Vertical support check must include grid edges as implicit support; propagation to open spaces only if they have <2 neighbors and are directly below/above the notch; no marking if no vertical support; horizontal extensions in vertical rows should cover the notch span plus adjacent; avoid over-marking by using grid copy and not re-processing marked cells; edges (top/bottom/left/right) need special handling to prevent index errors.
 * General: Process in order (prune first, then notches); 7s seem to "infect" or highlight without removing 1s; empty rows/columns (all 0s) should remain unchanged; subtle: notches on bottom/top edges may need symmetric handling, but code focuses on sides; no diagonal neighbors considered—only cardinal.
 * Bugs to avoid: Loop ranges must not exceed grid bounds (e.g., for double notches starting at j=2 to cols-3, not cols-1); accessing j+2 or i+/-1 without bounds checks causes index errors; use original g for neighbor counts, new_g for modifications.
 * Across attempts: No extraction of objects needed—direct grid mutation; consider multiple passes if notches create new danglers, but current code is single-pass per function.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def count_1_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    n = 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni = i + di
        nj = j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and g[ni][nj] == 1:
            n += 1
    return n
```
(This neighbor count is helpful and correct for pruning/weak connections; use it consistently with original g to avoid self-modification errors.)

```python
def prune_dangling(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                continue
            n = count_1_neighbors(new_g, i, j)  # Note: should use g here to avoid premature pruning
            if n < 2:
                new_g[i][j] = 0
    return new_g
```
(This is mostly helpful for initial cleanup but has a subtlety: counting on new_g can prune too aggressively in one pass; better to count on original g.)

(No object extraction functions are present or needed; the puzzle is grid-pattern based, not object-oriented.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented pruning and notch marking but failed all training examples and crashed on others due to index out of range errors (e.g., in mark_double_notches, j up to cols-1 but accessing j+2 without proper range limit to cols-3; similar in propagation loops).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated misses 7s in row1 cols2-4 (has 1,1,1,7,1 vs expected 1,1,7,7,7), row3 cols7-9 (has 1,1,7,1 vs 7,7,7), row9 cols5-7 (has 1,1,7,1 vs 1,7,7,7), row17 col13 (has 1 vs 7), row18 cols13-15 (has 1,1,7,7,7,1 vs 1,7,7,7,1—wait, expected has 7,7,7,1 but generated not shown fully); extra/missing in vertical propagations and edge handling; unknown why single notch in row4 col8 (0) didn't propagate correctly to match expected 7s around it.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has incorrect top rows (row0 ends 1,0 vs expected 7,0; row1 ends 1,1 vs 7,7); misses 7s in row5 cols13-15 (1,7,1 vs 7,7,7), row6 cols7-9 (1,1,7 vs 7,7,7), row7 cols13 (0 vs 7? wait, 0,7,7,7 but expected 0,7,7,7—minor), row8 cols7-9 (1,7,7 vs 7,7,7) and ends 1,7,0 vs 1,7,0 (match but context wrong); over-marks or misses double notch propagations in lower sections; top-right corner not handled as notch.
 * Crashes on Train 3 and Test: Due to unbound loops (e.g., j=cols-1 in double_notches accessing j+2); no empty grid handling or variable size checks; suggests program assumes fixed 17x16 but inputs vary.
 * Function mark_single_notches is partially helpful but buggy: vertical support sets has_vertical=True too loosely (e.g., edge check always True even without vertical 1s?); propagation only if <2 neighbors but uses g instead of new_g inconsistently; misses symmetric top/bottom fully.
 * Function mark_double_notches is broken/not helpful: range(2, cols-1) too loose (should be to cols-3); has_vertical loop over k=[0,1] but sets for jj=j+k without checking support per gap; extend horizontally uses max(0,j-1) to min(cols,j+3) but risks index error if j near edge; open_below assumes two 0s but propagates three-wide without neighbor check.
 * Function mark_vertical_notches is somewhat helpful for edges but incomplete: only handles left/right vertical gaps, not top/bottom; propagation to adjacent inner column uses for di in [-1,0,1] but ii=i+di without full bounds; misses if gap is at i=0 or i=rows-1.
 * Overall: Good structure with new_g copies and ordered processing, but lacks bounds safety, full symmetry (top/bottom notches), and precise vertical support logic; no iteration for chained effects; prune_dangling works conceptually but may need original g for counts.

**Test output:**
 * No valid generated output for test input—crashes with list index out of range, so cannot assess correctness; this indicates the program is unusable for variable or edge-case grids (e.g., smaller sizes, notches near bounds).
 * Based on errors, test likely has notches or patterns near grid edges (e.g., j near cols-1 in double_notches or i near 0/rows-1 in vertical), causing overreach; expected output probably requires safe bounds and full edge handling, including top/bottom horizontal notches not implemented.
 * Without running, hard to mentally simulate test grid (not provided), but if similar to trains, output should have 7s filling notch supports and propagations without crashes; current errors mean it doesn't make sense or handle real inputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty space, 1s for filled/shape pixels) where the goal is to identify and mark specific "notch" or indentation patterns on the boundaries of enclosed or semi-enclosed shapes using 7s, while pruning dangling or isolated 1s. The process simulates edge detection or boundary refinement, focusing on horizontal and vertical notches that indicate corners or indents in puzzle pieces, with rules prioritizing enclosed structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune isolated or low-connectivity 1s (dangling edges) first to clean up the grid before marking, using a neighbor count threshold of <2 to remove them, but ensure this doesn't affect valid boundary pixels.
 * Mark single horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-1 patterns in a row, but only if vertically enclosed (above or below is 1 or edge), then mark the flanking 1s and adjacent vertical neighbors as 7s; subtle: for open-below cases, check if the below cell has <2 neighbors to propagate marking downward.
 * Mark double horizontal notches: Detect 1-0-0-1 patterns, require vertical enclosure on both 0s, mark flanking 1s and nearby vertical segments; subtle: extend marking horizontally in the enclosing row to cover connected 1s within a small range (e.g., j-1 to j+3).
 * Mark vertical notches on edges: For left/right boundaries, detect 1-0 or 0-1 at column 0 or cols-1, mark the inner 1 and adjacent verticals if enclosed; subtle: vertical notches may need separate handling from horizontal ones to avoid overlap, and enclosure checks must include top/bottom edges.
 * All markings should preserve original 1s/0s but overlay 7s only on boundary 1s that form notches; avoid marking internal 1s or non-boundary areas.
 * Process in sequence: prune -> single notches -> double notches -> vertical notches, as later steps depend on cleaned grids.
 * Subtle enclosure: "Has enclosure" means at least one vertical side (above or below) has 1s covering the notch width; for open sides, use neighbor counts to infer loose enclosure.
 * Grids can have multiple disconnected shapes; markings are local to each.
 * No diagonal considerations in current rules, but future may need them for complex shapes.
 * Outputs use 7 to indicate marked boundaries, but 0s and unmarked 1s remain as-is.
 * Easy to miss: Propagating marks to adjacent cells in enclosing rows only if they are 1s; over-marking in open areas; failing to handle edge cases like notches at grid boundaries or multi-row indents.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 generated incorrect output: In row 16 (0-indexed), generated all 0s [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] but expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0], indicating failure to mark a horizontal notch or enclosure in the lower-right area; upper rows matched perfectly, suggesting the issue is with detecting distant or vertically open notches.
 * Training example 2 and 3 were correct, so core logic for single/double notches and pruning works for those shapes.
 * mark_single_notches partially works but misses propagation in some open-below cases, as seen in training 1's row 16 discrepancy.
 * mark_double_notches seems effective for wider indents but may not interact well with vertical marks.
 * mark_vertical_notches handles edges but likely incomplete for non-edge vertical indents; it only checks left/right columns, missing internal vertical notches.
 * Overall, the sequential processing works, but enclosure checks are too strict for bottom-open notches, leading to missed markings in training 1.
 * No extraction functions for objects/shapes were used or needed; the grid is processed in-place locally, so global object extraction isn't relevant (don't use it).
 * The count_1_neighbors function is helpful and correct for neighbor-based decisions.
 * prune_dangling is essential and working, as it cleans without affecting valid structures in correct examples.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows reasonable markings: e.g., 7s outlining what appear to be two main shapes (left blob and right structure with indents), with pruning likely removing the top-right empty areas; single/double notches marked horizontally in rows 3-12, and vertical on edges.
 * It looks mostly correct based on visual inspection—7s trace boundaries and indents without over-marking internals, and 0s remain in empty spaces; however, without the expected output, it's hard to confirm subtle misses like in training 1 (e.g., potential unmarked bottom enclosures in rows 12-15).
 * The output handles the test's complex shape (irregular blob on left, indented form on right) better than training 1's failure, suggesting improvements in propagation, but row 12 has [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] which might miss a vertical notch extension if the shape requires it.
 * No obvious errors like over-pruning or wrong 7 placements, but the all-0 trailing areas (columns 14-15) are correctly unpruned as they seem part of the input structure; if the test expects more 7s in bottom rows, the enclosure logic may still be the weak point.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the 3 train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, pixels, position/bbox) where one element clearly affects or relates to another in a repeatable way. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., overall grid size, isolated background without changes) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., exact pixel offsets or directional movements) are not included. Specific transformation rules (e.g., how a hole "moves" precisely) are called out as unknown where no clear, consistent link exists beyond the noted interactions.

1. **Color transformation between Blue and Dark Red**:
   - Input Blue regions (all examples consist exclusively of Blue) interact with output by partial recoloring: Some pixels from input Blue regions are transformed into Dark Red regions in the output.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains. Blue pixel counts decrease in output by an amount approximately or exactly matching the total pixels added in Dark Red regions (e.g., Train 1: Blue decreases by ~35, Dark Red adds ~38; Train 3: exact match at 20 pixels transformed). This implies a direct pixel-level interaction where Blue loses area to create Dark Red.

2. **Spatial position (bbox) containment**:
   - Input Blue region bboxes directly constrain output Dark Red region positions: All Dark Red regions in the output are fully contained within the bbox of one or more input Blue regions.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains. No Dark Red appears outside input Blue bboxes (e.g., Train 1: All 5 Dark Red bboxes nested in input [0,0-16,4], [0,9-16,14], [0,17-16,18]; Train 2: All 4 Dark Red in [6,5-11,9] or [0,0-15,15]; Train 3: Both Dark Red in [4,3-13,12]). This suggests input position bounds affect where transformations occur, preventing external placements.

3. **Hole count interaction between Blue and Dark Red**:
   - Input Blue hole counts (>0) affect output Dark Red hole counts: Blue regions with holes >0 in input lead to the creation of at least one Dark Red region with holes >0 in the output, within the same or overlapping bbox.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains. Input h>0 Blues always produce h>0 Dark Red nearby (e.g., Train 1: input h=1 at [0,9-16,14] → two h=1 Dark Red inside; Train 2: input h=1 at [6,5-11,9] and h=3 at [0,0-15,15] → three h=1 Dark Red inside/adjacent; Train 3: input h=2 at [4,3-13,12] → h=2 and h=1 Dark Red inside). Input h=0 Blues can produce h=0 Dark Red, but h>0 inputs never produce only h=0 Dark Red. Output Blue holes are often reduced compared to input (e.g., h=2 → h=1), suggesting holes are partially "transferred" or interacted with during color transformation.
   - Unknown: Exact mechanism of hole count modification (e.g., splitting, combining, or filling) is not consistently explainable; totals do not always conserve (e.g., Train 1 input total h=1 → output Dark Red total h=3).

4. **Small 1-pixel Blue regions (position and size) affecting edge/nearby Dark Red placement**:
   - Input small Blue regions (holes=0, pixels=1, single-point bbox) interact positionally with output Dark Red regions: These small Blues are consistently located near edges or boundaries of larger input Blues, and their positions correlate with the placement of at least one small or edge-adjacent Dark Red region (h=0 or h=1, pixels <15) in the output.
   - Consistency: Observed in all 3 trains, where every input has 1-2 such small Blues, and outputs have corresponding small/edge Dark Red near their input positions (e.g., Train 1: input 1px at [13,7] near right edge → output h=0 Dark Red at [15,1-16,3] right edge; input 1px at [3,15] near left bottom → output h=0 Dark Red at [2,0-4,1] left edge; Train 2: input 1px at [4,8] left-middle → output h=1 Dark Red at [5,12-8,14] nearby left-bottom; Train 3: input 1px at [15,4] right → output h=2 Dark Red at [9,5-12,8] rightish; input 1px at [1,14] left-bottom → output h=1 Dark Red at [6,11-8,13] left-bottom). These small Blues disappear in output (no 1px Blues remain), implying they initiate or seed nearby Dark Red creation.
   - Unknown: Precise positional transformation (e.g., exact x/y offset or direction from input 1px to output Dark Red) is not consistently identifiable; correlations are proximate but vary in distance/orientation.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable link between input pixels and output hole sizes, or between non-small Blue positions and specific Dark Red shapes). Elements like horizontal bars or silhouettes from the initial description do not appear consistently in the data.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:59:13] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving binary cells (0s for empty, 1s for filled or "walls") where the goal is to prune isolated or weakly connected 1s and then identify and mark specific gap-spanning patterns (like single or double gaps between 1s) horizontally or vertically with 7s, while propagating marks to adjacent rows under certain conditions (e.g., matching filled or empty patterns above/below). The process simulates identifying "bridges" or valid connections in a structure, possibly like a nonogram, minesweeper variant, or architectural puzzle where unsupported or gapped elements are highlighted.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Start with pruning: Remove (set to 0) any 1 that has fewer than 2 orthogonal neighbors that are also 1s; this must be iterative until no changes occur to eliminate dangling or isolated protrusions.
 * Horizontal patterns: Detect "1 0 1" (single gap) in non-edge positions and mark the flanking 1s as 7; handle left/right edges separately (e.g., "0 1" at left edge marks the 1 as 7); for double gaps "1 0 0 1", mark the outer 1s as 7 but only if exactly two 0s separate them.
 * Vertical patterns: Symmetric to horizontal—detect "1 0 1" vertically (mark flanking 1s), handle top/bottom edges (e.g., "0 1" at top marks the lower 1), and "1 0 0 1" vertically marking outers.
 * Propagation to adjacent rows: For a detected gap in row i, check row i-1 or i+1 at the gap's column(s): if the adjacent row has 1s in the relevant positions (e.g., three consecutive 1s over a single gap, or all-empty over a gap), mark those 1s as 7; for empty adjacent (0), mark if the "sides" are empty (e.g., left and right of the gap column are 0 or edge). This is asymmetric for edges and must avoid over-marking.
 * Order matters: Prune first, then apply horizontal marks (single, edges, double), then vertical (to avoid interfering); no iteration across all rules—single pass per function.
 * Subtleties: Edge cases like grid boundaries treated as implicit 0s; don't mark if pattern doesn't exactly match (e.g., no marking for "1 0 0 0 1"); propagation only if the adjacent row's center matches the gap type (filled or empty with side empties); avoid marking 0s or already-marked cells; double gaps don't propagate unless adjacent has exactly two 1s in the gap positions.
 * All 1s not in these patterns remain 1s; 0s stay 0 unless pruned (but prune only affects 1s); 7s indicate marked/identified elements, not changes to 0.
 * No diagonals considered—only orthogonal neighbors for pruning and patterns.
 * Grids can have empty rows/columns, but patterns ignore them unless part of adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Prune_dangling works correctly across all examples, as no dangling 1s are introduced or missed in comparisons.
 * Horizontal single/edge/double marking partially works: In training 1, correctly marks most 1 0 1 in top section (e.g., row 0 cols 2/4 as 7), but fails in bottom-left (row 11: marks col4 as 7 prematurely, expected 0 there; row 10 col5 as 7, expected 0).
 * Vertical marking has issues: In training 1, row 10 col5 marked 7 but should be 0 (possible over-propagation from horizontal); row 1 col15/16 as 7 correct, but inconsistent elsewhere.
 * Training 1 overall: Generated mismatches expected in ~5 positions (e.g., row 10 [1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7,...]—extra 7 at col5, missing 0 at col6; unknown why, possibly faulty propagation in mark_vertical_single for empty adjacent rows).
 * Training 2: Major failures—over-marks vertical patterns (e.g., row 2 all 1s marked as 7s incorrectly, expected all 1s; row 5 cols6-10/13-15 as 7s, but expected 1s in some like col13=0 not marked); row 8 col13=7 but expected 1; row 9 col13/15=1/7 expected but inconsistent; suggests vertical double/single logic marks too aggressively without checking full pattern isolation.
 * Training 3: Fully correct, indicating the function sequence works for simpler or specific patterns without complex propagations.
 * Edge functions (mark_horizontal_left_edge, etc.) partially helpful but buggy: In training 2, left edges over-mark (e.g., row 6 col12=0 marked 7 indirectly); right edges similar.
 * Double horizontal/vertical: Underused or incorrect—training 2 row 6/9 have 1 0 0 1 vertically? But marks extras; doesn't catch non-exact doubles.
 * Overall attempt: Good structure (prune then horizontal then vertical), but propagation logic in singles/edges flawed (e.g., empty adjacent marks too many cells, including non-1s or wrong spans); no iteration after marking, causing cascade misses; unhelpful for cases with multiple overlapping patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output looks partially correct but incomplete/inaccurate: Top rows (0-1) all 1s to col4 then 0s correct (no patterns); row 2 marks cols10-12 as 7s (likely vertical single propagation from below), but col13=0 correct; row 3 cols10/12=7 around 0 correct for horizontal single.
 * Issues: Row 4 cols4-6=7 but if input has 1 0 1 there? Wait, test input not provided, but assuming standard, over-marks row 5 col3=7 (possibly edge vertical); row 7 col3=0 but marked? No, generated has 0—wait, row 7 [1,1,7,0,7,7,1,...] seems to mark vertical single at col3 (1 above 0 below? But propagation to col2/4=7 correct?).
 * Mismatches likely: Row 8 col1=1 but if pattern, should be 7? Generated has 1s in places expected 7s (e.g., row 11 cols5-7=7 0 7 suggests single gap mark correct, but row 12 col8=0 not propagated properly?); bottom rows (13-15) all 0s after col4 correct, but row 12 has 7s at end—may over-mark if no double gap.
 * Overall, test output makes sense for simple patterns (e.g., vertical bridges in cols10-12) but likely misses subtle propagations (e.g., empty adjacent rows not marking correctly, similar to training 1); doesn't look fully correct due to potential over-marking in mid-grid (rows 6-8) where dense 1s/0s mix, explaining training failures.
