=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 19:40:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 19:47:21] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return g
    cols = len(g[0])

    # Rule 1: Remove 1s with fewer than 2 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) - cleans isolated or thin protrusions
    def remove_thin_protrusions(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] != 1:
                    continue
                count = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] == 1)
                if count < 2:
                    new_grid[i][j] = 0
        return new_grid

    # Rule 2: Color 1s to 7 if they have fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) - colors boundary/thin areas dark red
    def color_boundary_areas(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] != 1:
                    continue
                count = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] == 1)
                if count < 3:
                    new_grid[i][j] = 7
        return new_grid

    # Rule 3: Fill 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (8-connectivity) - fills small gaps near structures
    def fill_small_gaps(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] != 0:
                    continue
                count = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in (1, 7))
                if count >= 2:
                    new_grid[i][j] = 7
        return new_grid

    # Compose the rules: clean, color boundaries, fill gaps
    cleaned = remove_thin_protrusions(g)
    colored = color_boundary_areas(cleaned)
    filled = fill_small_gaps(colored)
    return filled

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:47:49] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions

    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):

                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:57:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)
```
This is helpful for consistent neighbor counting across steps.

```python
def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```
This is essential for isolating objects and could be used to process each blob independently, avoiding global errors.

```python
def extract_internal_holes(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract small internal 0 components (size <=2, 4-connectivity, not touching border)."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    holes = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                hole = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                hole.append((i, j))
                touches_border = (i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1)
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                            hole.append((ni, nj))
                            if ni == 0 or ni == rows - 1 or nj == 0 or nj == cols - 1:
                                touches_border = True
                if not touches_border and len(hole) <= 2:
                    holes.append(hole)
    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 19:57:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)
```
This is helpful for consistent neighbor counting across steps.

```python
def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```
This is essential for isolating objects and could be used to process each blob independently, avoiding global errors.

```python
def extract_internal_holes(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract small internal 0 components (size <=2, 4-connectivity, not touching border)."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    holes = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                hole = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                hole.append((i, j))
                touches_border = (i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1)
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                            hole.append((ni, nj))
                            if ni == 0 or ni == rows - 1 or nj == 0 or nj == cols - 1:
                                touches_border = True
                if not touches_border and len(hole) <= 2:
                    holes.append(hole)
    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:03:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing where isolated 1s are removed, background (connected to borders) is identified via flood fill, and then boundaries around enclosed "holes" (internal 0-regions surrounded by 1s) are marked by changing adjacent 1s to 7s, without altering background 0s or internal hole 0s. The goal is to highlight the edges of objects or shapes defined by 1s, treating enclosed 0s as holes and ignoring border-connected 0s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * First, remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal 1-neighbors) to clean up noise before identifying structures.
 * Use flood fill from border 0s to distinguish background 0s (connected to edges) from internal holes (enclosed 0s not reachable from borders); this is crucial to avoid marking background as part of holes.
 * For potential hole 0s, check orthogonal 1-neighbors with a threshold: 2 for border cells (to handle edge cases), 3 for internal cells (to ensure true enclosure); only proceed if threshold met.
 * Marking happens only on neighboring 1s (changed to 7s) for confirmed hole-adjacent 0s; do not mark 0s at all, even internal ones—7s are strictly for boundary 1s.
 * Use 8 directions for marking neighbors to capture diagonal boundaries, but count neighbors orthogonally (4 directions) for enclosure checks to avoid overcounting.
 * Subtlety: After removal and flood fill, use a fixed copy of the grid for counting neighbors to avoid modifying counts mid-process; process all 0s in original order.
 * Easy to miss: Do not mark background 0s or their neighbors as 7s, even if they have many 1-neighbors—this prevents "leaking" into exterior areas.
 * Another subtlety: Isolated 1s must be removed before flood fill, as they could block background propagation if not handled.
 * Border 0s should never trigger marking unless part of a shallow enclosure, but threshold helps filter.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects; process all independently.
 * No changes to 0s inside holes—they remain 0; only boundaries get 7s.
 * Potential issue: Stray 1s in output (e.g., not removed or incorrectly preserved) indicate removal step failure.
 * Consider grid size variations (e.g., 16x16, 17x17); ensure bounds checking in all loops.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy
from collections import deque

directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Orthogonal for neighbor counting/enclosure
directions_8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]  # For marking boundaries

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    # Counts matching neighbors in given directions; useful for isolation checks and enclosure thresholds
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)

def is_on_border(i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    # Checks if cell is on grid edge; used for lower threshold on borders
    return i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1
```

```python
# Flood fill for background identification (helpful for separating holes from exterior)
def identify_background(grid: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> set:
    background = set()
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    q = deque()
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if is_on_border(i, j, rows, cols) and grid[i][j] == 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                q.append((i, j))
                visited[i][j] = True
                background.add((i, j))
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions_4:
            nx, ny = x + di, y + dj
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                background.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return background
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this code) correctly removes isolated 1s in most cases but fails to remove some (e.g., stray 1 in training 1 row 14, column 8, which should be 0 in expected).
 * Flood fill for background works well, as most background 0s are untouched, but the marking step incorrectly sets neighboring background 0s to 7 when processing border-adjacent 0s with high 1-neighbor counts, leading to pollution (though not heavily visible in outputs).
 * Neighbor counting uses fixed_grid correctly, but marking loops over 8 directions and applies 7s to 1s properly for holes; however, the conditional "elif output[ni][nj] == 0 and is_bg" wrongly marks background 0-neighbors as 7, which may cause minor diffs.
 * Threshold (2 on border, 3 inside) is a good intuition for enclosure but over-marks in some shallow areas, e.g., in training 2 row 8, column 13 is 1 in generated but should be 1 (no change needed? wait, diff is in other spots like row 5 column 12: generated 1, expected 0? unclear, but mismatches exist).
 * In training 1, row 12 column 7 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected—likely a boundary 1 not marked because the adjacent 0 was misclassified as background or threshold not met.
 * In training 3, row 3 column 6 is 1 in generated but 0 in expected—indicates failure to remove an isolated 1 after step 1.
 * Processing order (all 0s after fixed_grid) is helpful but doesn't iterate to propagate marks; single pass misses chained boundaries.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., connected components for 1s) was attempted, which could help verify enclosures but isn't essential; the current approach is direct but buggy in marking conditions.
 * deepcopy is used well to avoid mutation issues.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The marking for background 0-neighbors (setting 0 to 7 if is_bg) is incorrect and should be removed entirely—it's not relevant and causes potential over-marking; don't use in future.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has extensive 7-marking on what appear to be boundaries around a large central structure, which looks plausible for enclosing holes (e.g., 7s outlining a blob in rows 3-12), but includes 7s on what might be background-adjacent 1s (e.g., top-left 1s unchanged, but some 0-regions in rows 2-3 have 7s that could be overreach).
 * It does not look fully correct: stray 0s inside potential holes (e.g., row 5 column 5=0, surrounded by 7s/1s) remain 0 as expected, but some boundary 1s like row 11 column 5=7 seem correct, yet the code's background-marking bug likely adds erroneous 7s in exterior areas (e.g., row 7 column 4=0 should stay 0, but if processed as bg, neighbors might be hit—output shows 7s nearby).
 * Missing: No isolated 1 removal visible, but test input has clean 1-structures; however, the output has unbroken 1-chains where 7s should split boundaries (e.g., row 4 columns 10-12=7,0,7 looks like hole marking, but compare mentally: input has 0s in top-right, likely background, so no 7s there—generated has them, indicating over-marking).
 * To handle test: Ensure marking only triggers for non-background 0s, and use stricter enclosure (e.g., confirm full surround); generated has too many 7s in potentially open areas (rows 0-1 all 1s/0s, but row 2 has 7s that might belong to internal hole only).

[2025-10-01 20:03:40] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (ensuring consistency across all three train examples), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every train case, without forcing explanations or attempting a full puzzle solution. Only direct, observable patterns (e.g., positional overlaps, property mappings, or consistent transformations) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., exact pixel counts varying without pattern, non-interacting background fills without modification) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., precise mechanism of transformation) are noted explicitly.

#### 1. **Single-Pixel Blue Blobs (Input) → Position of Dark Red Blobs (Output)**
   - **Description**: Isolated single-pixel Blue components (holes=0, pixels=1) in the input consistently correlate with the appearance of Dark Red blobs in the output, where the Dark Red bounding box (bbox) overlaps or is adjacent to the input single-pixel position. This suggests a positional influence, where the single pixel "seeds" or affects a local area.
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Singles at bbox=[13,7,13,7] and [3,15,3,15]; output Dark Red bboxes include [7,3,9,5] (near row/col overlap with [13,7]) and [4,9,7,12] + [13,16,15,18] (near bottom-left/right extensions from [3,15]).
     - Train 2: Single at [4,8,4,8]; output Dark Red at [13,5,15,9] + [7,6,9,8] (adjacent rows/cols around col4-8 area) and [5,12,8,14] (vertical extension nearby).
     - Train 3: Singles at [15,4,15,4] and [1,14,1,14]; output Dark Red at [9,5,12,8] (near row4 right-edge) and [6,11,8,13] (near row14 left-edge).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input position (bbox x/y coords) → Output position (Dark Red bbox placement). No color change for the single itself (it disappears), but it affects nearby region coloring to Dark Red.
   - **Unknown**: Exact distance or directional rule for "nearby" (e.g., why [13,7] maps to leftward shift in some cases); not forced.

#### 2. **Large Blue Blobs with Holes (Input) → Reduced Pixels and Hole Modification in Output Blue/Dark Red (Output)**
   - **Description**: Larger Blue blobs (pixels >20, holes ≥1) in the input consistently result in output Blue blobs with the same or similar bbox but reduced pixel counts, alongside new Dark Red blobs that inherit or modify the hole count (e.g., Dark Red gains holes=1 where input had holes ≥1). This indicates an interaction where holes in the input Blue "transfer" to or split into Dark Red components, affecting the fill density of remaining Blue.
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input middle Blue (holes=1, pixels=83, bbox=[0,9,16,14]) → Output Blue (holes=0, pixels=70, bbox=[0,9,16,13]) + multiple Dark Red with holes=1 (e.g., pixels=8-12).
     - Train 2: Input large Blue (holes=3, pixels=164, bbox=[0,0,15,15]) + smaller (holes=1, pixels=29) → Output Blue (holes=1, pixels=139/21) + Dark Red with holes=1 (pixels=8-11), total holes reduced but present in Dark Red.
     - Train 3: Input Blue (holes=2, pixels=88, bbox=[4,3,13,12]) → Output Blue (holes=1, pixels=70) + Dark Red with holes=2 and 1 (pixels=12/8), bbox overlap [4,4,13,12] → [4,4,13,12] for Blue.
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input hole count → Output hole distribution (split between Blue/Dark Red); input pixels (high) → output Blue pixels (reduced) + Dark Red pixels (added, low count). Bbox position preserved for Blue core.
   - **Unknown**: How exactly pixels are subtracted (e.g., no consistent ratio like 10-20% reduction); why some holes stay in Blue vs. move to Dark Red.

#### 3. **Single-Pixel Blue Blobs (Input) → Introduction of Dark Red Color (Output)**
   - **Description**: Every input single-pixel Blue blob (pixels=1, holes=0) is consistently linked to the creation of at least one new Dark Red blob in the output, without a direct Blue equivalent at that exact position. This implies the single pixel triggers a color transformation in an interacting region (e.g., from Blue to Dark Red).
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: 2 singles → 5 Dark Red blobs (all outputs have Dark Red only where singles present in input).
     - Train 2: 1 single → 4 Dark Red blobs.
     - Train 3: 2 singles → 2 Dark Red blobs.
     - No outputs lack Dark Red when singles are present; no Dark Red without nearby single influence.
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input component type (single-pixel Blue) → Output color introduction (Dark Red). Affects "scattered pixels/dots" property, turning isolated Blue into regional Dark Red accents.
   - **Unknown**: Why multiple Dark Red per single in some cases (e.g., Train 1 vs. Train 3); no forced shape link (e.g., not always L-shaped in bbox).

#### 4. **Position of Large Blue Blobs (Input) → Bbox Overlap with Dark Red (Output)**
   - **Description**: The bbox of large input Blue blobs (spanning multiple rows/cols) consistently overlaps with output Dark Red bboxes, indicating positional containment or boundary interaction where Dark Red emerges inside or along the edges of the input Blue area.
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input large bboxes ([0,0,16,4], [0,9,16,14], [0,17,16,18]) fully encompass output Dark Red bboxes (e.g., [2,0,4,1] inside top, [4,9,7,12] inside middle).
     - Train 2: Input [0,0,15,15] + [6,5,11,9] overlaps all output Dark Red (e.g., [13,5,15,9] on right edge, [5,12,8,14] bottom extension).
     - Train 3: Input [4,3,13,12] directly overlaps output Dark Red [9,5,12,8] and [6,11,8,13] (internal/subset positions).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input position (large bbox) → Output position (Dark Red placement within/adjacent). Ties to "nested/outlined squares" property, where Dark Red acts like internal "frames" or accents.
   - **Unknown**: Specific edge vs. interior preference (varies slightly, e.g., Train 2 has more edge cases).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-hole mapping beyond above, no consistent horizontal bar influence across all, no forced shape transformations like L-bends without bbox evidence). Test inputs were not analyzed for consistency checks, as instructions emphasize train examples for patterns. If additional data clarifies unknowns, more could be identified.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:04:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[tuple], target_values: tuple = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)

def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)
```
This is helpful for consistent neighbor counting across steps.

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

                            visited[ni][nj] = True

    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing where isolated 1s are removed, background (connected to borders) is identified via flood fill, and then boundaries around enclosed "holes" (internal 0-regions surrounded by 1s) are marked by changing adjacent 1s to 7s, without altering background 0s or internal hole 0s. The goal is to highlight the edges of objects or shapes defined by 1s, treating enclosed 0s as holes and ignoring border-connected 0s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * First, remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal 1-neighbors) to clean up noise before identifying structures.
 * Use flood fill from border 0s to distinguish background 0s (connected to edges) from internal holes (enclosed 0s not reachable from borders); this is crucial to avoid marking background as part of holes.
 * For potential hole 0s, check orthogonal 1-neighbors with a threshold: 2 for border cells (to handle edge cases), 3 for internal cells (to ensure true enclosure); only proceed if threshold met.
 * Marking happens only on neighboring 1s (changed to 7s) for confirmed hole-adjacent 0s; do not mark 0s at all, even internal ones—7s are strictly for boundary 1s.
 * Use 8 directions for marking neighbors to capture diagonal boundaries, but count neighbors orthogonally (4 directions) for enclosure checks to avoid overcounting.
 * Subtlety: After removal and flood fill, use a fixed copy of the grid for counting neighbors to avoid modifying counts mid-process; process all 0s in original order.
 * Easy to miss: Do not mark background 0s or their neighbors as 7s, even if they have many 1-neighbors—this prevents "leaking" into exterior areas.
 * Another subtlety: Isolated 1s must be removed before flood fill, as they could block background propagation if not handled.
 * Border 0s should never trigger marking unless part of a shallow enclosure, but threshold helps filter.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects; process all independently.
 * No changes to 0s inside holes—they remain 0; only boundaries get 7s.
 * Potential issue: Stray 1s in output (e.g., not removed or incorrectly preserved) indicate removal step failure.
 * Consider grid size variations (e.g., 16x16, 17x17); ensure bounds checking in all loops.

directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Orthogonal for neighbor counting/enclosure
directions_8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]  # For marking boundaries

    # Counts matching neighbors in given directions; useful for isolation checks and enclosure thresholds
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)

def is_on_border(i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    # Checks if cell is on grid edge; used for lower threshold on borders
    return i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1
```

```python
# Flood fill for background identification (helpful for separating holes from exterior)
def identify_background(grid: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> set:
    background = set()
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    q = deque()
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if is_on_border(i, j, rows, cols) and grid[i][j] == 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                q.append((i, j))
                visited[i][j] = True
                background.add((i, j))
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions_4:
            nx, ny = x + di, y + dj
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                background.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return background
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this code) correctly removes isolated 1s in most cases but fails to remove some (e.g., stray 1 in training 1 row 14, column 8, which should be 0 in expected).
 * Flood fill for background works well, as most background 0s are untouched, but the marking step incorrectly sets neighboring background 0s to 7 when processing border-adjacent 0s with high 1-neighbor counts, leading to pollution (though not heavily visible in outputs).
 * Neighbor counting uses fixed_grid correctly, but marking loops over 8 directions and applies 7s to 1s properly for holes; however, the conditional "elif output[ni][nj] == 0 and is_bg" wrongly marks background 0-neighbors as 7, which may cause minor diffs.
 * Threshold (2 on border, 3 inside) is a good intuition for enclosure but over-marks in some shallow areas, e.g., in training 2 row 8, column 13 is 1 in generated but should be 1 (no change needed? wait, diff is in other spots like row 5 column 12: generated 1, expected 0? unclear, but mismatches exist).
 * In training 1, row 12 column 7 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected—likely a boundary 1 not marked because the adjacent 0 was misclassified as background or threshold not met.
 * In training 3, row 3 column 6 is 1 in generated but 0 in expected—indicates failure to remove an isolated 1 after step 1.
 * Processing order (all 0s after fixed_grid) is helpful but doesn't iterate to propagate marks; single pass misses chained boundaries.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., connected components for 1s) was attempted, which could help verify enclosures but isn't essential; the current approach is direct but buggy in marking conditions.
 * deepcopy is used well to avoid mutation issues.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The marking for background 0-neighbors (setting 0 to 7 if is_bg) is incorrect and should be removed entirely—it's not relevant and causes potential over-marking; don't use in future.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has extensive 7-marking on what appear to be boundaries around a large central structure, which looks plausible for enclosing holes (e.g., 7s outlining a blob in rows 3-12), but includes 7s on what might be background-adjacent 1s (e.g., top-left 1s unchanged, but some 0-regions in rows 2-3 have 7s that could be overreach).
 * It does not look fully correct: stray 0s inside potential holes (e.g., row 5 column 5=0, surrounded by 7s/1s) remain 0 as expected, but some boundary 1s like row 11 column 5=7 seem correct, yet the code's background-marking bug likely adds erroneous 7s in exterior areas (e.g., row 7 column 4=0 should stay 0, but if processed as bg, neighbors might be hit—output shows 7s nearby).
 * Missing: No isolated 1 removal visible, but test input has clean 1-structures; however, the output has unbroken 1-chains where 7s should split boundaries (e.g., row 4 columns 10-12=7,0,7 looks like hole marking, but compare mentally: input has 0s in top-right, likely background, so no 7s there—generated has them, indicating over-marking).
 * To handle test: Ensure marking only triggers for non-background 0s, and use stricter enclosure (e.g., confirm full surround); generated has too many 7s in potentially open areas (rows 0-1 all 1s/0s, but row 2 has 7s that might belong to internal hole only).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (ensuring consistency across all three train examples), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every train case, without forcing explanations or attempting a full puzzle solution. Only direct, observable patterns (e.g., positional overlaps, property mappings, or consistent transformations) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., exact pixel counts varying without pattern, non-interacting background fills without modification) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., precise mechanism of transformation) are noted explicitly.

#### 1. **Single-Pixel Blue Blobs (Input) → Position of Dark Red Blobs (Output)**
   - **Description**: Isolated single-pixel Blue components (holes=0, pixels=1) in the input consistently correlate with the appearance of Dark Red blobs in the output, where the Dark Red bounding box (bbox) overlaps or is adjacent to the input single-pixel position. This suggests a positional influence, where the single pixel "seeds" or affects a local area.
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Singles at bbox=[13,7,13,7] and [3,15,3,15]; output Dark Red bboxes include [7,3,9,5] (near row/col overlap with [13,7]) and [4,9,7,12] + [13,16,15,18] (near bottom-left/right extensions from [3,15]).
     - Train 2: Single at [4,8,4,8]; output Dark Red at [13,5,15,9] + [7,6,9,8] (adjacent rows/cols around col4-8 area) and [5,12,8,14] (vertical extension nearby).
     - Train 3: Singles at [15,4,15,4] and [1,14,1,14]; output Dark Red at [9,5,12,8] (near row4 right-edge) and [6,11,8,13] (near row14 left-edge).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input position (bbox x/y coords) → Output position (Dark Red bbox placement). No color change for the single itself (it disappears), but it affects nearby region coloring to Dark Red.
   - **Unknown**: Exact distance or directional rule for "nearby" (e.g., why [13,7] maps to leftward shift in some cases); not forced.

#### 2. **Large Blue Blobs with Holes (Input) → Reduced Pixels and Hole Modification in Output Blue/Dark Red (Output)**
   - **Description**: Larger Blue blobs (pixels >20, holes ≥1) in the input consistently result in output Blue blobs with the same or similar bbox but reduced pixel counts, alongside new Dark Red blobs that inherit or modify the hole count (e.g., Dark Red gains holes=1 where input had holes ≥1). This indicates an interaction where holes in the input Blue "transfer" to or split into Dark Red components, affecting the fill density of remaining Blue.
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input middle Blue (holes=1, pixels=83, bbox=[0,9,16,14]) → Output Blue (holes=0, pixels=70, bbox=[0,9,16,13]) + multiple Dark Red with holes=1 (e.g., pixels=8-12).
     - Train 2: Input large Blue (holes=3, pixels=164, bbox=[0,0,15,15]) + smaller (holes=1, pixels=29) → Output Blue (holes=1, pixels=139/21) + Dark Red with holes=1 (pixels=8-11), total holes reduced but present in Dark Red.
     - Train 3: Input Blue (holes=2, pixels=88, bbox=[4,3,13,12]) → Output Blue (holes=1, pixels=70) + Dark Red with holes=2 and 1 (pixels=12/8), bbox overlap [4,4,13,12] → [4,4,13,12] for Blue.
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input hole count → Output hole distribution (split between Blue/Dark Red); input pixels (high) → output Blue pixels (reduced) + Dark Red pixels (added, low count). Bbox position preserved for Blue core.
   - **Unknown**: How exactly pixels are subtracted (e.g., no consistent ratio like 10-20% reduction); why some holes stay in Blue vs. move to Dark Red.

#### 3. **Single-Pixel Blue Blobs (Input) → Introduction of Dark Red Color (Output)**
   - **Description**: Every input single-pixel Blue blob (pixels=1, holes=0) is consistently linked to the creation of at least one new Dark Red blob in the output, without a direct Blue equivalent at that exact position. This implies the single pixel triggers a color transformation in an interacting region (e.g., from Blue to Dark Red).
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: 2 singles → 5 Dark Red blobs (all outputs have Dark Red only where singles present in input).
     - Train 2: 1 single → 4 Dark Red blobs.
     - Train 3: 2 singles → 2 Dark Red blobs.
     - No outputs lack Dark Red when singles are present; no Dark Red without nearby single influence.
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input component type (single-pixel Blue) → Output color introduction (Dark Red). Affects "scattered pixels/dots" property, turning isolated Blue into regional Dark Red accents.
   - **Unknown**: Why multiple Dark Red per single in some cases (e.g., Train 1 vs. Train 3); no forced shape link (e.g., not always L-shaped in bbox).

#### 4. **Position of Large Blue Blobs (Input) → Bbox Overlap with Dark Red (Output)**
   - **Description**: The bbox of large input Blue blobs (spanning multiple rows/cols) consistently overlaps with output Dark Red bboxes, indicating positional containment or boundary interaction where Dark Red emerges inside or along the edges of the input Blue area.
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input large bboxes ([0,0,16,4], [0,9,16,14], [0,17,16,18]) fully encompass output Dark Red bboxes (e.g., [2,0,4,1] inside top, [4,9,7,12] inside middle).
     - Train 2: Input [0,0,15,15] + [6,5,11,9] overlaps all output Dark Red (e.g., [13,5,15,9] on right edge, [5,12,8,14] bottom extension).
     - Train 3: Input [4,3,13,12] directly overlaps output Dark Red [9,5,12,8] and [6,11,8,13] (internal/subset positions).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input position (large bbox) → Output position (Dark Red placement within/adjacent). Ties to "nested/outlined squares" property, where Dark Red acts like internal "frames" or accents.
   - **Unknown**: Specific edge vs. interior preference (varies slightly, e.g., Train 2 has more edge cases).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-hole mapping beyond above, no consistent horizontal bar influence across all, no forced shape transformations like L-bends without bbox evidence). Test inputs were not analyzed for consistency checks, as instructions emphasize train examples for patterns. If additional data clarifies unknowns, more could be identified.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:12:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving binary image processing, where the goal is to preprocess a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/shape pixels) by removing noise like thin protrusions, identifying true background vs. internal holes, marking boundaries or edges of shapes with 7s (likely to highlight contours or fill shallow features), handling specific hole types (shallow internal ones to fill/mark, deeper ones to leave), and distinguishing external dents from internal features without over-marking or misclassifying regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules: Start by cleaning the grid (e.g., remove isolated or thinly connected 1s with <2 neighbors to eliminate noise/protrusions). Identify background as all 0s connected to the grid borders via flood fill (BFS/DFS from border 0s), treating internal enclosed 0s as holes. Mark 1s adjacent (8-directional) to internal (non-background) 0s as boundaries with 7 to highlight shape edges or holes. Fill or mark "shallow" holes—defined as internal 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) but with an "open" direction leading to background or edge—by setting the hole to 7, thinning adjacent walls to 0 if needed, and propagating marks to nearby regions (e.g., perpendicular sides or outer patches). For external dents (background 0s with >=2 adjacent 1s or exactly 3 neighbors), mark adjacent 1s as 7 without filling the dent itself, and extend marks horizontally/vertically if the dent opens to background.
 * Subtleties: Background flood fill must avoid marking internal holes as background; use visited array and only seed from border 0s. Shallow holes require checking "opposing" directions (e.g., if a wall 1 leads outward to background, fill the hole and mark/thin accordingly), but avoid over-filling deeper holes (e.g., those not directly open). External dents should not propagate marks into internal areas; use 4-directional for neighbor counts but 8 for adjacency checks. Thin protrusions are only removed if they have <2 1-neighbors (isolated or diagonal-only connections don't count as connected). Order matters: clean protrusions first, then background ID, then hole handling, then boundary marking, then dents—misordering can cascade errors (e.g., marking before cleaning leaves noise). 7s seem to represent "marked/filled boundary" but should not overwrite 1s unless thinning; avoid setting background 0s to 7 except in specific fills. Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; process all uniformly. Edge cases: fully enclosed shapes, 1-pixel holes/protrusions, diagonal connections (use 4-dir for connectivity, 8 for adjacency), and border-touching holes (treat as external/not shallow).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction needed (grids are small, process in-place); focus on topological features like connectivity and depth. Iterations may be needed for multi-layer holes, but single pass seems sufficient. Directions: 4-dir for orthogonal connectivity (e.g., neighbor counts for thinness/holes), 8-dir for boundary adjacency to catch diagonals. Outputs must preserve original 1/0 structure except for targeted 7 marks/fills—over-marking turns valid shapes into boundaries. Unknowns: Exact depth threshold for "shallow" (code assumes 1-layer, but may need recursion); why some expected 0s stay 0 while adjacent 1s get 7 (e.g., deep holes untouched).

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `handle_shallow_holes`: Overly complex and buggy—tries to fill 0s with 4 1-neighbors by checking "open" directions and propagating marks, but misfires (e.g., sets wrong outer patches to 7, thins incorrectly, marks perpendicular sides prematurely). Fills background-adjacent areas and creates artifacts; not handling depth properly leads to over-filling.
- `handle_external_dents`: Marks background 0s with >=2 or ==3 1-neighbors by setting adjacent 1s to 7 and extending horizontally/vertically, but propagates into internal regions and doesn't distinguish dent "openness" well (e.g., marks valid external 1s as boundaries). Condition for num_adj==3 assumes single open dir but fails on corners/diagonals; broken for multi-dent shapes.
- `is_on_border`: Unused in main program; simplistic (only checks edges) and not needed since background flood fill handles borders implicitly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in hole/dent handling despite good background ID and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated over-marks top-left 7s (e.g., row 0 cols 2-4 as 7,7,7 vs. expected 7,0,7; row 2 col 16 as 7 vs. 0) and adds extra 7s in bottom shapes (e.g., row 17 col 14 as 0,7,1 vs. expected 7,0,7,1—flipped hole mark); also fills row 5 entirely with 7s where expected has sparse 7s and 0s. What worked: Correctly identified some internal boundaries (e.g., row 1 cols 14-16 as 7,7). What didn't: Shallow hole logic filled external dents as internal and propagated wrongly (unknown why row 5 over-filled, possibly background mis-ID).
 * Train 2: Generated marks entire top/middle as 7s (e.g., row 2 all 7s vs. expected all 1s; row 3 cols 1-13 as 7,0s vs. expected 1,0s) and adds spurious 7s in bottom hole (e.g., row 7 col 9 as 0 vs. expected 0, but surrounds wrong). What worked: Some external dent marking (e.g., row 15 all 1s correct). What didn't: Boundary marking over-applied to non-hole areas; thin protrusion removal missed large 0-regions, treating them as shallow holes (unknown cascade from order).
 * Train 3: Generated adds outer 7-frame around shape (e.g., row 3 cols 3-15 as 7s vs. expected 0s; row 4 col 3 as 7 vs. 0) and over-marks internals (e.g., row 6 col 11 as 0 vs. expected 0, but adjacent 7s wrong). What worked: Some internal hole boundaries marked (e.g., row 6 cols 9-11 as 7,0,7 matching expected). What didn't: Dent handling marked border-adjacent 1s as 7 prematurely; protrusion removal insufficient, leaving stubs that triggered false boundaries.
 * Overall: Background flood fill works (correct in isolated tests, avoids internals). Neighbor counting solid. But handling functions broken—shallow fills propagate to background, dents mark too broadly, no iteration for multi-step cleans. No object extraction attempted (not needed, as global processing suffices). Program order exposes cleaned grid to flawed handlers, causing 7-overload.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s in ways inconsistent with training expectations, such as filling large internal regions (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 6-12 as all 7s, likely a mis-filled "hole" that's actually shape body) and adding spurious 0s/7s in bottom (e.g., row 11 cols 11-13 as 7,7,7 vs. probable need for sparser boundaries). External edges have inconsistent thinning (e.g., row 0 col 5 as 7,0s vs. expected clean 1s or marked only at dents). It resembles training failures: background ID probably correct, but shallow/dent logic cascades to mark valid 1s as 7 and leave deep holes unmarked. To fix for test: Refine shallow check to require explicit "outer open" to background (not just edge), limit propagation to 1-step, and apply dent marking only after all internals—test has complex nested shapes (e.g., central 1s with 0-dents), so need better depth (e.g., distance from background >1 for internal).

[2025-10-01 20:12:36] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** train example. These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way, without forcing explanations or assuming puzzle semantics. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts without transformation, non-recurring bbox shifts, or hole counts without clear transfer) are excluded. Unknown relations (e.g., exact positioning rules for transformations) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **1x1 Blue components (input) → Absence in output + Trigger for Dark Red creation**  
   - Small Blue components (bbox size 1x1, pixels=1, holes=0) consistently disappear entirely from outputs.  
   - Their presence correlates with the introduction of new Dark Red components in every output (no outputs lack Dark Red when input has 1x1 Blues).  
   - Interaction: Acts as a catalyst; no direct position-to-position mapping is obvious or consistent (unknown how they precisely determine Dark Red locations).  
   - Consistent across all: Train1 (2 such components → 5 Dark Reds), Train2 (1 → 4 Dark Reds), Train3 (2 → 2 Dark Reds).

2. **Large Blue components (input, pixels >1) → Pixel reduction in output Blue + Pixel addition in Dark Red**  
   - Large Blue regions (bbox spanning multiple units, often with holes) persist in outputs but with consistently reduced pixel counts.  
   - The reduction in Blue pixels matches (approximately or exactly) the total pixels added in new Dark Red components, indicating a direct transformation (Blue pixels converted to Dark Red).  
   - Interaction: Subregions of large Blues are affected, leading to color change (Blue → Dark Red) and pixel redistribution. Exact subregions affected are unknown (no consistent position or hole-based rule identifiable).  
   - Consistent across all: Train1 (total Blue input 200 → output Blue 165 + Dark Red 38; near-conservation), Train2 (194 → 160 + 32; near-conservation), Train3 (90 → 70 + 20; exact conservation). Small 1x1 Blues do not participate in this pixel transfer (they vanish without contributing pixels).

3. **Overall input Blue structure → Output structure with Blue + Dark Red layering**  
   - Input is exclusively Blue components; outputs always include both retained/modified Blue components and new Dark Red components overlaid or extracted from input Blues.  
   - Interaction: Global transformation where Dark Red emerges from Blue "canvas" (no reverse or isolated Dark Red creation without Blue input). No standalone Blue-to-Blue changes occur without Dark Red involvement.  
   - Consistent across all: Every output modifies the input's Blue-dominated structure by introducing Dark Red, with no examples of unchanged or Blue-only outputs.

No other connections (e.g., specific position-to-position effects, hole count transfers, color-based movement, or shape-specific transformations like L-shapes/bars to purple frames) are obvious or consistent across every train example. For instance, bbox adjustments occur in some cases (Train1, Train3) but not others (Train2), so they are not included. Semantic meanings (e.g., black/purple elements) cannot be linked without forcing inconsistent relations.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:13:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[tuple], target_values: tuple = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)

def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)
```
This is helpful for consistent neighbor counting across steps.

```python
def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```
This is essential for isolating objects and could be used to process each blob independently, avoiding global errors.

```python
def extract_internal_holes(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract small internal 0 components (size <=2, 4-connectivity, not touching border)."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    holes = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                hole = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                hole.append((i, j))
                touches_border = (i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1)
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                            hole.append((ni, nj))
                            if ni == 0 or ni == rows - 1 or nj == 0 or nj == cols - 1:
                                touches_border = True
                if not touches_border and len(hole) <= 2:
                    holes.append(hole)
    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing where isolated 1s are removed, background (connected to borders) is identified via flood fill, and then boundaries around enclosed "holes" (internal 0-regions surrounded by 1s) are marked by changing adjacent 1s to 7s, without altering background 0s or internal hole 0s. The goal is to highlight the edges of objects or shapes defined by 1s, treating enclosed 0s as holes and ignoring border-connected 0s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * First, remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal 1-neighbors) to clean up noise before identifying structures.
 * Use flood fill from border 0s to distinguish background 0s (connected to edges) from internal holes (enclosed 0s not reachable from borders); this is crucial to avoid marking background as part of holes.
 * For potential hole 0s, check orthogonal 1-neighbors with a threshold: 2 for border cells (to handle edge cases), 3 for internal cells (to ensure true enclosure); only proceed if threshold met.
 * Marking happens only on neighboring 1s (changed to 7s) for confirmed hole-adjacent 0s; do not mark 0s at all, even internal ones—7s are strictly for boundary 1s.
 * Use 8 directions for marking neighbors to capture diagonal boundaries, but count neighbors orthogonally (4 directions) for enclosure checks to avoid overcounting.
 * Subtlety: After removal and flood fill, use a fixed copy of the grid for counting neighbors to avoid modifying counts mid-process; process all 0s in original order.
 * Easy to miss: Do not mark background 0s or their neighbors as 7s, even if they have many 1-neighbors—this prevents "leaking" into exterior areas.
 * Another subtlety: Isolated 1s must be removed before flood fill, as they could block background propagation if not handled.
 * Border 0s should never trigger marking unless part of a shallow enclosure, but threshold helps filter.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects; process all independently.
 * No changes to 0s inside holes—they remain 0; only boundaries get 7s.
 * Potential issue: Stray 1s in output (e.g., not removed or incorrectly preserved) indicate removal step failure.
 * Consider grid size variations (e.g., 16x16, 17x17); ensure bounds checking in all loops.

        for j in range(cols):
            if is_on_border(i, j, rows, cols) and grid[i][j] == 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                q.append((i, j))
                visited[i][j] = True
                background.add((i, j))
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions_4:
            nx, ny = x + di, y + dj
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                background.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return background
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this code) correctly removes isolated 1s in most cases but fails to remove some (e.g., stray 1 in training 1 row 14, column 8, which should be 0 in expected).
 * Flood fill for background works well, as most background 0s are untouched, but the marking step incorrectly sets neighboring background 0s to 7 when processing border-adjacent 0s with high 1-neighbor counts, leading to pollution (though not heavily visible in outputs).
 * Neighbor counting uses fixed_grid correctly, but marking loops over 8 directions and applies 7s to 1s properly for holes; however, the conditional "elif output[ni][nj] == 0 and is_bg" wrongly marks background 0-neighbors as 7, which may cause minor diffs.
 * Threshold (2 on border, 3 inside) is a good intuition for enclosure but over-marks in some shallow areas, e.g., in training 2 row 8, column 13 is 1 in generated but should be 1 (no change needed? wait, diff is in other spots like row 5 column 12: generated 1, expected 0? unclear, but mismatches exist).
 * In training 1, row 12 column 7 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected—likely a boundary 1 not marked because the adjacent 0 was misclassified as background or threshold not met.
 * In training 3, row 3 column 6 is 1 in generated but 0 in expected—indicates failure to remove an isolated 1 after step 1.
 * Processing order (all 0s after fixed_grid) is helpful but doesn't iterate to propagate marks; single pass misses chained boundaries.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., connected components for 1s) was attempted, which could help verify enclosures but isn't essential; the current approach is direct but buggy in marking conditions.
 * deepcopy is used well to avoid mutation issues.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The marking for background 0-neighbors (setting 0 to 7 if is_bg) is incorrect and should be removed entirely—it's not relevant and causes potential over-marking; don't use in future.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has extensive 7-marking on what appear to be boundaries around a large central structure, which looks plausible for enclosing holes (e.g., 7s outlining a blob in rows 3-12), but includes 7s on what might be background-adjacent 1s (e.g., top-left 1s unchanged, but some 0-regions in rows 2-3 have 7s that could be overreach).
 * It does not look fully correct: stray 0s inside potential holes (e.g., row 5 column 5=0, surrounded by 7s/1s) remain 0 as expected, but some boundary 1s like row 11 column 5=7 seem correct, yet the code's background-marking bug likely adds erroneous 7s in exterior areas (e.g., row 7 column 4=0 should stay 0, but if processed as bg, neighbors might be hit—output shows 7s nearby).
 * Missing: No isolated 1 removal visible, but test input has clean 1-structures; however, the output has unbroken 1-chains where 7s should split boundaries (e.g., row 4 columns 10-12=7,0,7 looks like hole marking, but compare mentally: input has 0s in top-right, likely background, so no 7s there—generated has them, indicating over-marking).
 * To handle test: Ensure marking only triggers for non-background 0s, and use stricter enclosure (e.g., confirm full surround); generated has too many 7s in potentially open areas (rows 0-1 all 1s/0s, but row 2 has 7s that might belong to internal hole only).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving binary image processing, where the goal is to preprocess a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/shape pixels) by removing noise like thin protrusions, identifying true background vs. internal holes, marking boundaries or edges of shapes with 7s (likely to highlight contours or fill shallow features), handling specific hole types (shallow internal ones to fill/mark, deeper ones to leave), and distinguishing external dents from internal features without over-marking or misclassifying regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules: Start by cleaning the grid (e.g., remove isolated or thinly connected 1s with <2 neighbors to eliminate noise/protrusions). Identify background as all 0s connected to the grid borders via flood fill (BFS/DFS from border 0s), treating internal enclosed 0s as holes. Mark 1s adjacent (8-directional) to internal (non-background) 0s as boundaries with 7 to highlight shape edges or holes. Fill or mark "shallow" holes—defined as internal 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) but with an "open" direction leading to background or edge—by setting the hole to 7, thinning adjacent walls to 0 if needed, and propagating marks to nearby regions (e.g., perpendicular sides or outer patches). For external dents (background 0s with >=2 adjacent 1s or exactly 3 neighbors), mark adjacent 1s as 7 without filling the dent itself, and extend marks horizontally/vertically if the dent opens to background.
 * Subtleties: Background flood fill must avoid marking internal holes as background; use visited array and only seed from border 0s. Shallow holes require checking "opposing" directions (e.g., if a wall 1 leads outward to background, fill the hole and mark/thin accordingly), but avoid over-filling deeper holes (e.g., those not directly open). External dents should not propagate marks into internal areas; use 4-directional for neighbor counts but 8 for adjacency checks. Thin protrusions are only removed if they have <2 1-neighbors (isolated or diagonal-only connections don't count as connected). Order matters: clean protrusions first, then background ID, then hole handling, then boundary marking, then dents—misordering can cascade errors (e.g., marking before cleaning leaves noise). 7s seem to represent "marked/filled boundary" but should not overwrite 1s unless thinning; avoid setting background 0s to 7 except in specific fills. Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; process all uniformly. Edge cases: fully enclosed shapes, 1-pixel holes/protrusions, diagonal connections (use 4-dir for connectivity, 8 for adjacency), and border-touching holes (treat as external/not shallow).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction needed (grids are small, process in-place); focus on topological features like connectivity and depth. Iterations may be needed for multi-layer holes, but single pass seems sufficient. Directions: 4-dir for orthogonal connectivity (e.g., neighbor counts for thinness/holes), 8-dir for boundary adjacency to catch diagonals. Outputs must preserve original 1/0 structure except for targeted 7 marks/fills—over-marking turns valid shapes into boundaries. Unknowns: Exact depth threshold for "shallow" (code assumes 1-layer, but may need recursion); why some expected 0s stay 0 while adjacent 1s get 7 (e.g., deep holes untouched).

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `handle_shallow_holes`: Overly complex and buggy—tries to fill 0s with 4 1-neighbors by checking "open" directions and propagating marks, but misfires (e.g., sets wrong outer patches to 7, thins incorrectly, marks perpendicular sides prematurely). Fills background-adjacent areas and creates artifacts; not handling depth properly leads to over-filling.
- `handle_external_dents`: Marks background 0s with >=2 or ==3 1-neighbors by setting adjacent 1s to 7 and extending horizontally/vertically, but propagates into internal regions and doesn't distinguish dent "openness" well (e.g., marks valid external 1s as boundaries). Condition for num_adj==3 assumes single open dir but fails on corners/diagonals; broken for multi-dent shapes.
- `is_on_border`: Unused in main program; simplistic (only checks edges) and not needed since background flood fill handles borders implicitly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in hole/dent handling despite good background ID and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated over-marks top-left 7s (e.g., row 0 cols 2-4 as 7,7,7 vs. expected 7,0,7; row 2 col 16 as 7 vs. 0) and adds extra 7s in bottom shapes (e.g., row 17 col 14 as 0,7,1 vs. expected 7,0,7,1—flipped hole mark); also fills row 5 entirely with 7s where expected has sparse 7s and 0s. What worked: Correctly identified some internal boundaries (e.g., row 1 cols 14-16 as 7,7). What didn't: Shallow hole logic filled external dents as internal and propagated wrongly (unknown why row 5 over-filled, possibly background mis-ID).
 * Train 2: Generated marks entire top/middle as 7s (e.g., row 2 all 7s vs. expected all 1s; row 3 cols 1-13 as 7,0s vs. expected 1,0s) and adds spurious 7s in bottom hole (e.g., row 7 col 9 as 0 vs. expected 0, but surrounds wrong). What worked: Some external dent marking (e.g., row 15 all 1s correct). What didn't: Boundary marking over-applied to non-hole areas; thin protrusion removal missed large 0-regions, treating them as shallow holes (unknown cascade from order).
 * Train 3: Generated adds outer 7-frame around shape (e.g., row 3 cols 3-15 as 7s vs. expected 0s; row 4 col 3 as 7 vs. 0) and over-marks internals (e.g., row 6 col 11 as 0 vs. expected 0, but adjacent 7s wrong). What worked: Some internal hole boundaries marked (e.g., row 6 cols 9-11 as 7,0,7 matching expected). What didn't: Dent handling marked border-adjacent 1s as 7 prematurely; protrusion removal insufficient, leaving stubs that triggered false boundaries.
 * Overall: Background flood fill works (correct in isolated tests, avoids internals). Neighbor counting solid. But handling functions broken—shallow fills propagate to background, dents mark too broadly, no iteration for multi-step cleans. No object extraction attempted (not needed, as global processing suffices). Program order exposes cleaned grid to flawed handlers, causing 7-overload.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s in ways inconsistent with training expectations, such as filling large internal regions (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 6-12 as all 7s, likely a mis-filled "hole" that's actually shape body) and adding spurious 0s/7s in bottom (e.g., row 11 cols 11-13 as 7,7,7 vs. probable need for sparser boundaries). External edges have inconsistent thinning (e.g., row 0 col 5 as 7,0s vs. expected clean 1s or marked only at dents). It resembles training failures: background ID probably correct, but shallow/dent logic cascades to mark valid 1s as 7 and leave deep holes unmarked. To fix for test: Refine shallow check to require explicit "outer open" to background (not just edge), limit propagation to 1-step, and apply dent marking only after all internals—test has complex nested shapes (e.g., central 1s with 0-dents), so need better depth (e.g., distance from background >1 for internal).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** train example. These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way, without forcing explanations or assuming puzzle semantics. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts without transformation, non-recurring bbox shifts, or hole counts without clear transfer) are excluded. Unknown relations (e.g., exact positioning rules for transformations) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **1x1 Blue components (input) → Absence in output + Trigger for Dark Red creation**  
   - Small Blue components (bbox size 1x1, pixels=1, holes=0) consistently disappear entirely from outputs.  
   - Their presence correlates with the introduction of new Dark Red components in every output (no outputs lack Dark Red when input has 1x1 Blues).  
   - Interaction: Acts as a catalyst; no direct position-to-position mapping is obvious or consistent (unknown how they precisely determine Dark Red locations).  
   - Consistent across all: Train1 (2 such components → 5 Dark Reds), Train2 (1 → 4 Dark Reds), Train3 (2 → 2 Dark Reds).

2. **Large Blue components (input, pixels >1) → Pixel reduction in output Blue + Pixel addition in Dark Red**  
   - Large Blue regions (bbox spanning multiple units, often with holes) persist in outputs but with consistently reduced pixel counts.  
   - The reduction in Blue pixels matches (approximately or exactly) the total pixels added in new Dark Red components, indicating a direct transformation (Blue pixels converted to Dark Red).  
   - Interaction: Subregions of large Blues are affected, leading to color change (Blue → Dark Red) and pixel redistribution. Exact subregions affected are unknown (no consistent position or hole-based rule identifiable).  
   - Consistent across all: Train1 (total Blue input 200 → output Blue 165 + Dark Red 38; near-conservation), Train2 (194 → 160 + 32; near-conservation), Train3 (90 → 70 + 20; exact conservation). Small 1x1 Blues do not participate in this pixel transfer (they vanish without contributing pixels).

3. **Overall input Blue structure → Output structure with Blue + Dark Red layering**  
   - Input is exclusively Blue components; outputs always include both retained/modified Blue components and new Dark Red components overlaid or extracted from input Blues.  
   - Interaction: Global transformation where Dark Red emerges from Blue "canvas" (no reverse or isolated Dark Red creation without Blue input). No standalone Blue-to-Blue changes occur without Dark Red involvement.  
   - Consistent across all: Every output modifies the input's Blue-dominated structure by introducing Dark Red, with no examples of unchanged or Blue-only outputs.

No other connections (e.g., specific position-to-position effects, hole count transfers, color-based movement, or shape-specific transformations like L-shapes/bars to purple frames) are obvious or consistent across every train example. For instance, bbox adjustments occur in some cases (Train1, Train3) but not others (Train2), so they are not included. Semantic meanings (e.g., black/purple elements) cannot be linked without forcing inconsistent relations.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:24:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the grid to remove isolated 1s and mark (with 7s) specific gap-filling or bridging patterns in horizontal and vertical directions, likely to highlight connected regions or paths while preserving the overall structure. The output transforms the input grid by setting certain 1s to 7s to indicate bridges over gaps of size 1 or 2, with rules considering adjacency, openness on sides, and interactions between rows/columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-directional neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't contribute to connected structures.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a row), mark the flanking 1s as 7s and propagate 7s to adjacent 1s above/below within the gap span; avoid bridging if both above and below the gap are fully zero in that span.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 2 (two 0s between two 1s), similar marking but with more complex conditions: bridge if below is all zeros or (all ones and above has a zero); propagate to adjacent rows only under specific all-zero/all-one conditions.
 * For vertical gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a column), mark flanking 1s as 7s and check left/right openness (if both open, propagate to adjacent 1s; if one side open and all-zero/all-one, bridge that side; otherwise, propagate to 1s on sides).
 * Subtlety: Propagation doesn't always fill entire adjacent rows/columns—only to 1s or under all-zero conditions; avoid over-marking closed sides.
 * Order of operations matters: apply isolated removal first, then horizontal handlers, then vertical, as changes can affect later detections.
 * Gaps must be detected without overlapping or skipping due to loop increments (e.g., j +=1 in size2 handler risks missing adjacent gaps).
 * Edge cases: Gaps at grid borders (e.g., open if at edge), multi-row interactions (e.g., don't bridge if sandwiched between zeros), and larger structures where gaps interact (e.g., L-shapes or corners may require vertical after horizontal).
 * No diagonal considerations—only 4-directional neighbors.
 * 7s seem to "infect" or highlight bridges but don't change 0s to 1s; preserve original 0s unless part of a bridge condition.
 * Potential for iterative application? Current code is single-pass per handler, but some expected outputs suggest multiple interactions (e.g., new gaps created by prior markings).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

directions_4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Useful for neighbor counting in isolation and adjacency checks.

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """
    Counts neighbors matching target value in given directions.
    Helpful for detecting isolation (n==0) and could be extended for gap validation.
    """
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target)

def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Sets isolated 1s (no 4-neighbors that are 1) to 0.
    This is a solid base step, as it cleans up noise before gap handling; worked in all examples for removing loners.
    """
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    output = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1:
                n = count_neighbors(g, i, j, rows, cols, directions_4)
                if n == 0:
                    output[i][j] = 0
    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) partially understands gap bridging but fails all training examples, correctly removing some isolations (e.g., in train1 row 14, isolated 1 becomes 0) but missing many 7 placements.
 * In train1: Generated marks some horizontal bridges (e.g., row0 cols2/4 as 7s matching expected) and vertical in row4 col8/10, but misses vertical bridges in row11 (expected 7s at col4-6, generated all 1s or 0s) and row12 (expected full 7 bridge row5 cols4-7, generated plain 1s); also row16 expected has 7s at cols13-15 but generated all 0s—unknown why vertical handler skipped it, possibly due to prior horizontal changes or openness checks failing; row1 col16/17 has extra 7s not in expected.
 * In train2: Generated correctly handles some vertical gaps (e.g., row7 col13-15 as 7,0,7 matching) and horizontal in row12 (7s at cols5-8), but misses top-right vertical bridge (row0 col14=7, row1 col14/15=7,7 expected but generated 0,1,1); also row8 col14=1 expected but generated 1 (wait, minor); row9 col14=7 expected but 1; row14 col5=7 expected but 1, and row14 has no 7s at cols5-8 where expected full bridge—handler likely failed all-one condition or propagation.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly leaves a stray 1 at row3 col6 (should be removed as isolated, but remove_isolated missed it? Wait, it has neighbors? No, expected all 0 there); marks some 7s correctly (e.g., row5 col9-11), but over-marks or misses in row12 (7s at cols6-8 match, but row6 col11=7 generated vs expected 1? Minor diff); overall, vertical handler works for main structure but misses cleaning upper isolated 1.
 * Handlers for horizontal size1/size2 catch basic gaps but loop in size2 (j+=1) may skip overlapping gaps; vertical handler is overly complex with openness checks that fail edge cases (e.g., when both sides closed but should propagate minimally).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and mostly works but applied only once—may need re-application after bridging.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., connected components) attempted, which could help identify larger blobs with internal gaps; current pattern-matching is brittle for irregular shapes.
 * Function handle_vertical_size1 is broken/incomplete: logic for open_left/open_right has redundancy (e.g., else clause propagates regardless) and misses cases like train1 row16 where a horizontal gap below needs vertical tie-in; not fully helpful yet.
 * handle_horizontal_size2 has condition for all_one_below and has_zero_above, which worked in train2 row12 but failed train1 row12 (didn't create the full bridge).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense as it marks 7s in patterns resembling bridges (e.g., row4 cols4-6/11-13 as 7s for horizontal gaps, row7 col2-4 for vertical), and cleans some 0-regions, but looks incorrect overall due to inconsistencies like row8 col4=0 (likely a gap not bridged, but expected might fill based on train patterns) and over-marking in row10 (7s at col10-12/13? but test input has sparse 1s there—may be propagating too far).
 * Missing potential vertical bridges in left columns (e.g., rows3-13 col4 has 1s with 0s, generated some 7s but not continuous like train1 row12 expected full row); row12 has 7s at cols5-7 but then 0s, suggesting handler stopped prematurely—does not look correct as it leaves apparent gaps unbridged.
 * Extra 7s in row5 col13=7 where input is 1 but may not need marking (over-propagation?); top rows all 1s unchanged except edges, but test input has 0s in cols5+ which stay 0—plausible but likely misses horizontal size2 in row3-5 cols10-13.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates partial gap handling but fails to create cohesive structures (e.g., no full vertical bridges on right like train2), so it does not look correct—needs better propagation and iteration.

[2025-10-01 20:24:42] Response:
- **Background colors**: Alternating horizontal bands of blue and black across multiple rows in both input and output grids.
- **Black elements**: Solid black squares, horizontal/vertical lines (1-3 units long), and L-shaped polyominoes (2-3 units) positioned variably in corners, centers, or edges of blue bands.
- **Blue elements**: Small solid blue squares or dots, occasionally standalone or adjacent to black shapes within blue bands.
- **Purple/magenta elements**: Introduced in output; small solid purple squares, sometimes forming frames or L-shapes around black elements, positioned in upper/lower bands or as overlays.
- **Grid structure**: 5x5 or similar pixelated layout per band, with empty (transparent/white) spaces separating elements; input focuses on black-on-blue, output adds purple accents and minor blue details.

[2025-10-01 20:24:42] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Background colors**: Alternating horizontal bands of blue and black across multiple rows in both input and output grids.
- **Black elements**: Solid black squares, horizontal/vertical lines (1-3 units long), and L-shaped polyominoes (2-3 units) positioned variably in corners, centers, or edges of blue bands.
- **Blue elements**: Small solid blue squares or dots, occasionally standalone or adjacent to black shapes within blue bands.
- **Purple/magenta elements**: Introduced in output; small solid purple squares, sometimes forming frames or L-shapes around black elements, positioned in upper/lower bands or as overlays.
- **Grid structure**: 5x5 or similar pixelated layout per band, with empty (transparent/white) spaces separating elements; input focuses on black-on-blue, output adds purple accents and minor blue details.
- **Symmetry and progression**: Elements show rotational/mirror symmetry (e.g., top-left to bottom-right), with output generalizing input by layering colors and increasing complexity in shapes like bordered squares.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements that are consistent across **every** train example. These are limited to properties like position, color, holes, pixel count, and bounding box (bbox) that show clear cause-effect or dependency relationships. I focused solely on patterns where one property reliably affects or transforms another in all cases, without inferring solutions or high-level rules. Irrelevant elements (e.g., background bands without direct ties to blobs) or inconsistent ones (e.g., exact hole count changes vary) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., why specific pixel subsets change) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Input Blue Pixel Count → Output Blue Pixel Count (Reduction via Color Transformation)**
   - **Description**: Every input blue blob corresponds to one or more output blue blobs with overlapping or contained bboxes, where the total output blue pixels are strictly less than the input blue pixels for that component (e.g., train 1: 82 → 67; train 2: 29 → 21 and 164 → 139; train 3: 88 → 70). The difference in pixels consistently accounts for the total pixels in new dark red blobs (roughly equal, within ~5% variance, suggesting direct pixel-level transfer).
   - **Interaction Type**: Pixel count (size property) → color change. Some blue pixels are transformed to dark red, reducing blue mass while preserving overall blob position.
   - **Consistency**: Present in all three trains; no exceptions. Small input blues (1 pixel) often fragment into multiple smaller output blues or contribute to reductions.
   - **Unknown**: Exact which pixels transform (e.g., edges vs. interior); no consistent rule identifiable from data.

#### 2. **Input Blue Bbox Position → Output Blue and Dark Red Bbox Positions (Containment/Overlay)**
   - **Description**: Output blue blobs have bboxes that are subsets or near-identical to input blue bboxes (e.g., train 1: [0,0,16,4] → [0,0,16,4]; train 2: [6,5,11,9] → [6,5,11,9]; train 3: [4,3,13,12] → [4,4,13,12] with minor y-shift). New dark red blobs are always positioned inside or directly adjacent to these input bboxes (e.g., train 1: dark reds at [4,9,7,12] inside [0,9,16,14]; train 2: [13,5,15,9] adjacent to [6,5,11,9]; train 3: [9,5,12,8] inside [4,3,13,12]).
   - **Interaction Type**: Position → position (spatial dependency). Input blue position constrains where dark red "overlays" or "inserts" occur, without shifting the core blue structure.
   - **Consistency**: Every input blue bbox directly influences at least one output blue and one dark red bbox in all trains. No output elements appear outside input blue bboxes.
   - **Unknown**: Precise offset rules for minor bbox adjustments (e.g., y-shifts in train 3); consistent but not fully explainable.

#### 3. **Input Blue Holes → Output Dark Red Holes (Count Transfer)**
   - **Description**: Input blue blobs with holes (≥1) always result in output dark red blobs that have holes, with the total hole count across dark reds at least matching or exceeding the input hole count for that blob (e.g., train 1: 1 hole → two dark reds with 1 hole each; train 2: 1+3=4 holes → three dark reds with 1 hole each + one with 0, but positioned near holed areas; train 3: 2 holes → one dark red with 2 holes + one with 1). Dark reds are never created from hole-less input blues alone.
   - **Interaction Type**: Hole count (topological property) → new color with inherited holes. Holes in blue "spawn" dark red components that inherit or distribute the hole structure.
   - **Consistency**: Only holed input blues produce holed dark reds in all trains; hole-less inputs produce no holed dark reds (e.g., train 1 small 0-hole blues → 0-hole dark reds). Total holes are preserved or increased via dark red creation.
   - **Unknown**: How holes are split or merged between dark reds (e.g., 3 holes → multiple 1-hole dark reds in train 2); consistent transfer but mechanism unclear.

#### 4. **Input Small Blue Position (1 Pixel) → Output Small Dark Red Position (Symmetry-Based Placement)**
   - **Description**: 1-pixel input blue blobs (always present in all trains) lead to small (≤5 pixels) dark red blobs in output positions that are symmetrically mirrored or rotated relative to the input position, often across a central axis (e.g., train 1: input [13,7] right-center → output [15,1,16,3] upper-right mirror; [3,15] lower-left → [2,0,4,1] upper-left rotation; train 2: [4,8] left-center → [14,0,15,1] right-upper mirror; train 3: [15,4] right-middle → influences central dark red [9,5,12,8]; [1,14] left-bottom → [6,11,8,13] lower-center shift).
   - **Interaction Type**: Position → position via transform (symmetry). Small blue positions trigger dark red creation in symmetric counterparts, affecting movement/placement.
   - **Consistency**: Every train has 1-2 small input blues, each linking to at least one small output dark red via mirror/rotation (top-left/bottom-right axis implied in all). No small input blue lacks a symmetric dark red counterpart.
   - **Unknown**: Exact symmetry type (mirror vs. 90° rotation varies slightly); consistent directional effect but not uniform angle.

No other interactions (e.g., color → movement, edges/silhouettes → transform, or non-holed properties) are consistently observable across all trains without forcing unrelated connections. Elements like total grid structure or standalone pixels without the above ties are irrelevant or inconsistent.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:25:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[tuple], target_values: tuple = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)

def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the grid to remove isolated 1s and mark (with 7s) specific gap-filling or bridging patterns in horizontal and vertical directions, likely to highlight connected regions or paths while preserving the overall structure. The output transforms the input grid by setting certain 1s to 7s to indicate bridges over gaps of size 1 or 2, with rules considering adjacency, openness on sides, and interactions between rows/columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-directional neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't contribute to connected structures.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a row), mark the flanking 1s as 7s and propagate 7s to adjacent 1s above/below within the gap span; avoid bridging if both above and below the gap are fully zero in that span.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 2 (two 0s between two 1s), similar marking but with more complex conditions: bridge if below is all zeros or (all ones and above has a zero); propagate to adjacent rows only under specific all-zero/all-one conditions.
 * For vertical gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a column), mark flanking 1s as 7s and check left/right openness (if both open, propagate to adjacent 1s; if one side open and all-zero/all-one, bridge that side; otherwise, propagate to 1s on sides).
 * Subtlety: Propagation doesn't always fill entire adjacent rows/columns—only to 1s or under all-zero conditions; avoid over-marking closed sides.
 * Order of operations matters: apply isolated removal first, then horizontal handlers, then vertical, as changes can affect later detections.
 * Gaps must be detected without overlapping or skipping due to loop increments (e.g., j +=1 in size2 handler risks missing adjacent gaps).
 * Edge cases: Gaps at grid borders (e.g., open if at edge), multi-row interactions (e.g., don't bridge if sandwiched between zeros), and larger structures where gaps interact (e.g., L-shapes or corners may require vertical after horizontal).
 * No diagonal considerations—only 4-directional neighbors.
 * 7s seem to "infect" or highlight bridges but don't change 0s to 1s; preserve original 0s unless part of a bridge condition.
 * Potential for iterative application? Current code is single-pass per handler, but some expected outputs suggest multiple interactions (e.g., new gaps created by prior markings).

        return []

    output = [row[:] for row in g]

        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1:
                n = count_neighbors(g, i, j, rows, cols, directions_4)
                if n == 0:
                    output[i][j] = 0
    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) partially understands gap bridging but fails all training examples, correctly removing some isolations (e.g., in train1 row 14, isolated 1 becomes 0) but missing many 7 placements.
 * In train1: Generated marks some horizontal bridges (e.g., row0 cols2/4 as 7s matching expected) and vertical in row4 col8/10, but misses vertical bridges in row11 (expected 7s at col4-6, generated all 1s or 0s) and row12 (expected full 7 bridge row5 cols4-7, generated plain 1s); also row16 expected has 7s at cols13-15 but generated all 0s—unknown why vertical handler skipped it, possibly due to prior horizontal changes or openness checks failing; row1 col16/17 has extra 7s not in expected.
 * In train2: Generated correctly handles some vertical gaps (e.g., row7 col13-15 as 7,0,7 matching) and horizontal in row12 (7s at cols5-8), but misses top-right vertical bridge (row0 col14=7, row1 col14/15=7,7 expected but generated 0,1,1); also row8 col14=1 expected but generated 1 (wait, minor); row9 col14=7 expected but 1; row14 col5=7 expected but 1, and row14 has no 7s at cols5-8 where expected full bridge—handler likely failed all-one condition or propagation.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly leaves a stray 1 at row3 col6 (should be removed as isolated, but remove_isolated missed it? Wait, it has neighbors? No, expected all 0 there); marks some 7s correctly (e.g., row5 col9-11), but over-marks or misses in row12 (7s at cols6-8 match, but row6 col11=7 generated vs expected 1? Minor diff); overall, vertical handler works for main structure but misses cleaning upper isolated 1.
 * Handlers for horizontal size1/size2 catch basic gaps but loop in size2 (j+=1) may skip overlapping gaps; vertical handler is overly complex with openness checks that fail edge cases (e.g., when both sides closed but should propagate minimally).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and mostly works but applied only once—may need re-application after bridging.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., connected components) attempted, which could help identify larger blobs with internal gaps; current pattern-matching is brittle for irregular shapes.
 * Function handle_vertical_size1 is broken/incomplete: logic for open_left/open_right has redundancy (e.g., else clause propagates regardless) and misses cases like train1 row16 where a horizontal gap below needs vertical tie-in; not fully helpful yet.
 * handle_horizontal_size2 has condition for all_one_below and has_zero_above, which worked in train2 row12 but failed train1 row12 (didn't create the full bridge).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense as it marks 7s in patterns resembling bridges (e.g., row4 cols4-6/11-13 as 7s for horizontal gaps, row7 col2-4 for vertical), and cleans some 0-regions, but looks incorrect overall due to inconsistencies like row8 col4=0 (likely a gap not bridged, but expected might fill based on train patterns) and over-marking in row10 (7s at col10-12/13? but test input has sparse 1s there—may be propagating too far).
 * Missing potential vertical bridges in left columns (e.g., rows3-13 col4 has 1s with 0s, generated some 7s but not continuous like train1 row12 expected full row); row12 has 7s at cols5-7 but then 0s, suggesting handler stopped prematurely—does not look correct as it leaves apparent gaps unbridged.
 * Extra 7s in row5 col13=7 where input is 1 but may not need marking (over-propagation?); top rows all 1s unchanged except edges, but test input has 0s in cols5+ which stay 0—plausible but likely misses horizontal size2 in row3-5 cols10-13.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates partial gap handling but fails to create cohesive structures (e.g., no full vertical bridges on right like train2), so it does not look correct—needs better propagation and iteration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing where isolated 1s are removed, background (connected to borders) is identified via flood fill, and then boundaries around enclosed "holes" (internal 0-regions surrounded by 1s) are marked by changing adjacent 1s to 7s, without altering background 0s or internal hole 0s. The goal is to highlight the edges of objects or shapes defined by 1s, treating enclosed 0s as holes and ignoring border-connected 0s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * First, remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal 1-neighbors) to clean up noise before identifying structures.
 * Use flood fill from border 0s to distinguish background 0s (connected to edges) from internal holes (enclosed 0s not reachable from borders); this is crucial to avoid marking background as part of holes.
 * For potential hole 0s, check orthogonal 1-neighbors with a threshold: 2 for border cells (to handle edge cases), 3 for internal cells (to ensure true enclosure); only proceed if threshold met.
 * Marking happens only on neighboring 1s (changed to 7s) for confirmed hole-adjacent 0s; do not mark 0s at all, even internal ones—7s are strictly for boundary 1s.
 * Use 8 directions for marking neighbors to capture diagonal boundaries, but count neighbors orthogonally (4 directions) for enclosure checks to avoid overcounting.
 * Subtlety: After removal and flood fill, use a fixed copy of the grid for counting neighbors to avoid modifying counts mid-process; process all 0s in original order.
 * Easy to miss: Do not mark background 0s or their neighbors as 7s, even if they have many 1-neighbors—this prevents "leaking" into exterior areas.
 * Another subtlety: Isolated 1s must be removed before flood fill, as they could block background propagation if not handled.
 * Border 0s should never trigger marking unless part of a shallow enclosure, but threshold helps filter.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects; process all independently.
 * No changes to 0s inside holes—they remain 0; only boundaries get 7s.
 * Potential issue: Stray 1s in output (e.g., not removed or incorrectly preserved) indicate removal step failure.
 * Consider grid size variations (e.g., 16x16, 17x17); ensure bounds checking in all loops.

                background.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return background
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this code) correctly removes isolated 1s in most cases but fails to remove some (e.g., stray 1 in training 1 row 14, column 8, which should be 0 in expected).
 * Flood fill for background works well, as most background 0s are untouched, but the marking step incorrectly sets neighboring background 0s to 7 when processing border-adjacent 0s with high 1-neighbor counts, leading to pollution (though not heavily visible in outputs).
 * Neighbor counting uses fixed_grid correctly, but marking loops over 8 directions and applies 7s to 1s properly for holes; however, the conditional "elif output[ni][nj] == 0 and is_bg" wrongly marks background 0-neighbors as 7, which may cause minor diffs.
 * Threshold (2 on border, 3 inside) is a good intuition for enclosure but over-marks in some shallow areas, e.g., in training 2 row 8, column 13 is 1 in generated but should be 1 (no change needed? wait, diff is in other spots like row 5 column 12: generated 1, expected 0? unclear, but mismatches exist).
 * In training 1, row 12 column 7 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected—likely a boundary 1 not marked because the adjacent 0 was misclassified as background or threshold not met.
 * In training 3, row 3 column 6 is 1 in generated but 0 in expected—indicates failure to remove an isolated 1 after step 1.
 * Processing order (all 0s after fixed_grid) is helpful but doesn't iterate to propagate marks; single pass misses chained boundaries.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., connected components for 1s) was attempted, which could help verify enclosures but isn't essential; the current approach is direct but buggy in marking conditions.
 * deepcopy is used well to avoid mutation issues.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The marking for background 0-neighbors (setting 0 to 7 if is_bg) is incorrect and should be removed entirely—it's not relevant and causes potential over-marking; don't use in future.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has extensive 7-marking on what appear to be boundaries around a large central structure, which looks plausible for enclosing holes (e.g., 7s outlining a blob in rows 3-12), but includes 7s on what might be background-adjacent 1s (e.g., top-left 1s unchanged, but some 0-regions in rows 2-3 have 7s that could be overreach).
 * It does not look fully correct: stray 0s inside potential holes (e.g., row 5 column 5=0, surrounded by 7s/1s) remain 0 as expected, but some boundary 1s like row 11 column 5=7 seem correct, yet the code's background-marking bug likely adds erroneous 7s in exterior areas (e.g., row 7 column 4=0 should stay 0, but if processed as bg, neighbors might be hit—output shows 7s nearby).
 * Missing: No isolated 1 removal visible, but test input has clean 1-structures; however, the output has unbroken 1-chains where 7s should split boundaries (e.g., row 4 columns 10-12=7,0,7 looks like hole marking, but compare mentally: input has 0s in top-right, likely background, so no 7s there—generated has them, indicating over-marking).
 * To handle test: Ensure marking only triggers for non-background 0s, and use stricter enclosure (e.g., confirm full surround); generated has too many 7s in potentially open areas (rows 0-1 all 1s/0s, but row 2 has 7s that might belong to internal hole only).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving binary image processing, where the goal is to preprocess a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/shape pixels) by removing noise like thin protrusions, identifying true background vs. internal holes, marking boundaries or edges of shapes with 7s (likely to highlight contours or fill shallow features), handling specific hole types (shallow internal ones to fill/mark, deeper ones to leave), and distinguishing external dents from internal features without over-marking or misclassifying regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules: Start by cleaning the grid (e.g., remove isolated or thinly connected 1s with <2 neighbors to eliminate noise/protrusions). Identify background as all 0s connected to the grid borders via flood fill (BFS/DFS from border 0s), treating internal enclosed 0s as holes. Mark 1s adjacent (8-directional) to internal (non-background) 0s as boundaries with 7 to highlight shape edges or holes. Fill or mark "shallow" holes—defined as internal 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) but with an "open" direction leading to background or edge—by setting the hole to 7, thinning adjacent walls to 0 if needed, and propagating marks to nearby regions (e.g., perpendicular sides or outer patches). For external dents (background 0s with >=2 adjacent 1s or exactly 3 neighbors), mark adjacent 1s as 7 without filling the dent itself, and extend marks horizontally/vertically if the dent opens to background.
 * Subtleties: Background flood fill must avoid marking internal holes as background; use visited array and only seed from border 0s. Shallow holes require checking "opposing" directions (e.g., if a wall 1 leads outward to background, fill the hole and mark/thin accordingly), but avoid over-filling deeper holes (e.g., those not directly open). External dents should not propagate marks into internal areas; use 4-directional for neighbor counts but 8 for adjacency checks. Thin protrusions are only removed if they have <2 1-neighbors (isolated or diagonal-only connections don't count as connected). Order matters: clean protrusions first, then background ID, then hole handling, then boundary marking, then dents—misordering can cascade errors (e.g., marking before cleaning leaves noise). 7s seem to represent "marked/filled boundary" but should not overwrite 1s unless thinning; avoid setting background 0s to 7 except in specific fills. Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; process all uniformly. Edge cases: fully enclosed shapes, 1-pixel holes/protrusions, diagonal connections (use 4-dir for connectivity, 8 for adjacency), and border-touching holes (treat as external/not shallow).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction needed (grids are small, process in-place); focus on topological features like connectivity and depth. Iterations may be needed for multi-layer holes, but single pass seems sufficient. Directions: 4-dir for orthogonal connectivity (e.g., neighbor counts for thinness/holes), 8-dir for boundary adjacency to catch diagonals. Outputs must preserve original 1/0 structure except for targeted 7 marks/fills—over-marking turns valid shapes into boundaries. Unknowns: Exact depth threshold for "shallow" (code assumes 1-layer, but may need recursion); why some expected 0s stay 0 while adjacent 1s get 7 (e.g., deep holes untouched).

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `handle_shallow_holes`: Overly complex and buggy—tries to fill 0s with 4 1-neighbors by checking "open" directions and propagating marks, but misfires (e.g., sets wrong outer patches to 7, thins incorrectly, marks perpendicular sides prematurely). Fills background-adjacent areas and creates artifacts; not handling depth properly leads to over-filling.
- `handle_external_dents`: Marks background 0s with >=2 or ==3 1-neighbors by setting adjacent 1s to 7 and extending horizontally/vertically, but propagates into internal regions and doesn't distinguish dent "openness" well (e.g., marks valid external 1s as boundaries). Condition for num_adj==3 assumes single open dir but fails on corners/diagonals; broken for multi-dent shapes.
- `is_on_border`: Unused in main program; simplistic (only checks edges) and not needed since background flood fill handles borders implicitly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in hole/dent handling despite good background ID and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated over-marks top-left 7s (e.g., row 0 cols 2-4 as 7,7,7 vs. expected 7,0,7; row 2 col 16 as 7 vs. 0) and adds extra 7s in bottom shapes (e.g., row 17 col 14 as 0,7,1 vs. expected 7,0,7,1—flipped hole mark); also fills row 5 entirely with 7s where expected has sparse 7s and 0s. What worked: Correctly identified some internal boundaries (e.g., row 1 cols 14-16 as 7,7). What didn't: Shallow hole logic filled external dents as internal and propagated wrongly (unknown why row 5 over-filled, possibly background mis-ID).
 * Train 2: Generated marks entire top/middle as 7s (e.g., row 2 all 7s vs. expected all 1s; row 3 cols 1-13 as 7,0s vs. expected 1,0s) and adds spurious 7s in bottom hole (e.g., row 7 col 9 as 0 vs. expected 0, but surrounds wrong). What worked: Some external dent marking (e.g., row 15 all 1s correct). What didn't: Boundary marking over-applied to non-hole areas; thin protrusion removal missed large 0-regions, treating them as shallow holes (unknown cascade from order).
 * Train 3: Generated adds outer 7-frame around shape (e.g., row 3 cols 3-15 as 7s vs. expected 0s; row 4 col 3 as 7 vs. 0) and over-marks internals (e.g., row 6 col 11 as 0 vs. expected 0, but adjacent 7s wrong). What worked: Some internal hole boundaries marked (e.g., row 6 cols 9-11 as 7,0,7 matching expected). What didn't: Dent handling marked border-adjacent 1s as 7 prematurely; protrusion removal insufficient, leaving stubs that triggered false boundaries.
 * Overall: Background flood fill works (correct in isolated tests, avoids internals). Neighbor counting solid. But handling functions broken—shallow fills propagate to background, dents mark too broadly, no iteration for multi-step cleans. No object extraction attempted (not needed, as global processing suffices). Program order exposes cleaned grid to flawed handlers, causing 7-overload.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s in ways inconsistent with training expectations, such as filling large internal regions (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 6-12 as all 7s, likely a mis-filled "hole" that's actually shape body) and adding spurious 0s/7s in bottom (e.g., row 11 cols 11-13 as 7,7,7 vs. probable need for sparser boundaries). External edges have inconsistent thinning (e.g., row 0 col 5 as 7,0s vs. expected clean 1s or marked only at dents). It resembles training failures: background ID probably correct, but shallow/dent logic cascades to mark valid 1s as 7 and leave deep holes unmarked. To fix for test: Refine shallow check to require explicit "outer open" to background (not just edge), limit propagation to 1-step, and apply dent marking only after all internals—test has complex nested shapes (e.g., central 1s with 0-dents), so need better depth (e.g., distance from background >1 for internal).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements that are consistent across **every** train example. These are limited to properties like position, color, holes, pixel count, and bounding box (bbox) that show clear cause-effect or dependency relationships. I focused solely on patterns where one property reliably affects or transforms another in all cases, without inferring solutions or high-level rules. Irrelevant elements (e.g., background bands without direct ties to blobs) or inconsistent ones (e.g., exact hole count changes vary) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., why specific pixel subsets change) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Input Blue Pixel Count → Output Blue Pixel Count (Reduction via Color Transformation)**
   - **Description**: Every input blue blob corresponds to one or more output blue blobs with overlapping or contained bboxes, where the total output blue pixels are strictly less than the input blue pixels for that component (e.g., train 1: 82 → 67; train 2: 29 → 21 and 164 → 139; train 3: 88 → 70). The difference in pixels consistently accounts for the total pixels in new dark red blobs (roughly equal, within ~5% variance, suggesting direct pixel-level transfer).
   - **Interaction Type**: Pixel count (size property) → color change. Some blue pixels are transformed to dark red, reducing blue mass while preserving overall blob position.
   - **Consistency**: Present in all three trains; no exceptions. Small input blues (1 pixel) often fragment into multiple smaller output blues or contribute to reductions.
   - **Unknown**: Exact which pixels transform (e.g., edges vs. interior); no consistent rule identifiable from data.

#### 2. **Input Blue Bbox Position → Output Blue and Dark Red Bbox Positions (Containment/Overlay)**
   - **Description**: Output blue blobs have bboxes that are subsets or near-identical to input blue bboxes (e.g., train 1: [0,0,16,4] → [0,0,16,4]; train 2: [6,5,11,9] → [6,5,11,9]; train 3: [4,3,13,12] → [4,4,13,12] with minor y-shift). New dark red blobs are always positioned inside or directly adjacent to these input bboxes (e.g., train 1: dark reds at [4,9,7,12] inside [0,9,16,14]; train 2: [13,5,15,9] adjacent to [6,5,11,9]; train 3: [9,5,12,8] inside [4,3,13,12]).
   - **Interaction Type**: Position → position (spatial dependency). Input blue position constrains where dark red "overlays" or "inserts" occur, without shifting the core blue structure.
   - **Consistency**: Every input blue bbox directly influences at least one output blue and one dark red bbox in all trains. No output elements appear outside input blue bboxes.
   - **Unknown**: Precise offset rules for minor bbox adjustments (e.g., y-shifts in train 3); consistent but not fully explainable.

#### 3. **Input Blue Holes → Output Dark Red Holes (Count Transfer)**
   - **Description**: Input blue blobs with holes (≥1) always result in output dark red blobs that have holes, with the total hole count across dark reds at least matching or exceeding the input hole count for that blob (e.g., train 1: 1 hole → two dark reds with 1 hole each; train 2: 1+3=4 holes → three dark reds with 1 hole each + one with 0, but positioned near holed areas; train 3: 2 holes → one dark red with 2 holes + one with 1). Dark reds are never created from hole-less input blues alone.
   - **Interaction Type**: Hole count (topological property) → new color with inherited holes. Holes in blue "spawn" dark red components that inherit or distribute the hole structure.
   - **Consistency**: Only holed input blues produce holed dark reds in all trains; hole-less inputs produce no holed dark reds (e.g., train 1 small 0-hole blues → 0-hole dark reds). Total holes are preserved or increased via dark red creation.
   - **Unknown**: How holes are split or merged between dark reds (e.g., 3 holes → multiple 1-hole dark reds in train 2); consistent transfer but mechanism unclear.

#### 4. **Input Small Blue Position (1 Pixel) → Output Small Dark Red Position (Symmetry-Based Placement)**
   - **Description**: 1-pixel input blue blobs (always present in all trains) lead to small (≤5 pixels) dark red blobs in output positions that are symmetrically mirrored or rotated relative to the input position, often across a central axis (e.g., train 1: input [13,7] right-center → output [15,1,16,3] upper-right mirror; [3,15] lower-left → [2,0,4,1] upper-left rotation; train 2: [4,8] left-center → [14,0,15,1] right-upper mirror; train 3: [15,4] right-middle → influences central dark red [9,5,12,8]; [1,14] left-bottom → [6,11,8,13] lower-center shift).
   - **Interaction Type**: Position → position via transform (symmetry). Small blue positions trigger dark red creation in symmetric counterparts, affecting movement/placement.
   - **Consistency**: Every train has 1-2 small input blues, each linking to at least one small output dark red via mirror/rotation (top-left/bottom-right axis implied in all). No small input blue lacks a symmetric dark red counterpart.
   - **Unknown**: Exact symmetry type (mirror vs. 90° rotation varies slightly); consistent directional effect but not uniform angle.

No other interactions (e.g., color → movement, edges/silhouettes → transform, or non-holed properties) are consistently observable across all trains without forcing unrelated connections. Elements like total grid structure or standalone pixels without the above ties are irrelevant or inconsistent.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:34:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing binary grids (0s and 1s representing empty space and filled shapes/objects) to clean up irregular features like thin protrusions, identify and mark small gaps or runs of 0s (possibly "cracks" or "holes" in shapes), and highlight adjacent areas using 7s, likely to emphasize boundaries, small defects, or connectable gaps without altering the core structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents shapes or "blobs" of 1s surrounded by 0s; the goal is to preserve main shapes while removing or marking minor irregularities like thin lines (protrusions with <2 neighbors) and small 0-runs (<=2 consecutive 0s in rows, possibly indicating narrow gaps).
 * 7s are used to "mark" or highlight specific 1s adjacent (using 8 directions) to small 0-runs, but only if they touch the run; overmarking internal 1s as 7s (e.g., solid blocks) is incorrect, as seen in examples where expected output keeps core 1s unchanged.
 * Single 0-gaps between 1s in rows should trigger marking of nearby 0s above/below (if they form a small empty area of 3 consecutive 0s), but only if flanked by 1s; this seems aimed at filling or noting bridgeable gaps, but must not propagate to larger empty areas or alter non-gap 1s.
 * Cleaning must be iterative and only remove isolated/thin 1s (<2 orthogonal neighbors), but stop before eroding main shapes; subtle: use 4 directions for cleaning to avoid diagonal erosion, but 8 for marking to catch diagonal adjacencies.
 * Grids have borders of 0s or 1s in some cases (e.g., full rows of 1s or 0s); do not mark border 1s unless they directly border small internal 0-runs.
 * Subtle elements: Small 0-runs are row-specific (horizontal only in current code), but may need vertical/hole detection; avoid marking in large empty areas (runs >2); 7s should not replace 0s in core empty spaces or create new 1s—only overlay on existing 1s or specific 0s.
 * Order matters: Clean protrusions first, then fill/mark gaps on the cleaned grid; running marking before cleaning can propagate errors.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-cell gaps vs. protrusions; diagonal connections shouldn't trigger cleaning but may for marking; no global connectivity (e.g., flood fill) yet, but may be needed to distinguish separate objects.
 * Across attempts: No object extraction yet, but shapes seem like letters/symbols (e.g., ex2 looks like a figure with arms/legs); 7s highlight "defects" like small holes or thin parts without removing them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

directions_4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Orthogonal for cleaning/neighbor counting to avoid over-erosion
directions_8 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]  # For marking diagonal touches

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Counts neighbors matching target_values in given directions; useful for identifying isolated 1s or gaps."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)
```

```python
def clean_thin_protrusions(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Iteratively removes 1s with <2 orthogonal neighbors (thin protrusions); works well for ex1 but may need tuning for thicker arms in ex2/ex3."""
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows else 0
    current = [row[:] for row in grid]
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        new_grid = [row[:] for row in current]
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if current[i][j] == 1:
                    n = count_neighbors(current, i, j, rows, cols, directions_4, (1,))
                    if n < 2:
                        new_grid[i][j] = 0
                        changed = True
        current = new_grid
    return current
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly handles training example 1, preserving a clean shape with appropriate 7s on small edge gaps.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated overmarks some 1s as 7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs expected1; row5 col13:7 vs1; row6 col12:0 but marks surrounding as7 incorrectly; row8 col13:7 vs0? Wait, expected has1 there but generated7; row9 col13:1 vs0—mismatch); under-marks others (e.g., row6 col12 should be1 but generated0, missing7 nearby); fill_single_gaps marks too aggressively in vertical gaps, turning solid1s into7s; mark_small_zero_runs catches horizontal runs<=2 but misses vertical/diagonal contexts, leading to extra7s in row7-9 cols7-10.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated over-erodes or over-marks core1s as7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs1; row5 col9-11:7,7,7 vs1,1,1; row6 col11:7 vs7? but row6 col12:7 vs0 mismatch; row7 col11:0 vs0 ok but surrounding7s extra; row8 col10:1 vs1 ok but row8 col11-12:7,7 vs7,7 ok—partial; row12 col6-8:7,7,7 vs7,7,7 ok); cleaning removes too little (shape intact but marking turns internal "thick" parts to7s); fill_single_gaps incorrectly fills non-single gaps or propagates to borders.
 * clean_thin_protrusions is helpful and correct for ex1 (removes isolates without harming main blob), but may not handle "thin but connected" arms in ex2/ex3 (e.g., doesn't remove enough in vertical thin parts).
 * mark_small_zero_runs is partially helpful for horizontal small gaps but broken for overmarking (uses8-dir on any adjacent1, hitting internals; should check if1 is "edge" or limit to run ends); doesn't handle vertical runs.
 * fill_single_gaps is unhelpful/broken: Only checks horizontal single0s flanked by1s, then marks3-wide0s above/below if all0—but in ex2/ex3, this creates extra7s in larger empty areas (e.g., ex3 row5-6 gaps marked wrongly); doesn't fill the gap itself (sets output on0s to7, but expected keeps some0s); ignores vertical singles; not relevant if puzzle is about marking borders, not filling.
 * No object extraction function yet, but needed for future: Separate blobs to process independently (e.g., via flood fill) to avoid cross-marking; current code treats whole grid as one, causing issues in multi-object grids like ex3 (multiple shapes?).
 * Overall: Core cleaning works (ex1 pass), but marking logic misses subtlety of "small defects only" (overmarks thick/internal1s); no vertical gap detection; order of fill/mark causes propagation errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it overmarks internal and thick parts of the main shape with7s (e.g., row3 cols10-12:7,7,7 seem like marking a small horizontal0-run above, but expected likely keeps core1s as1s per ex2/ex3 patterns; row4 col11:0 isolated but surrounded by7s—may be underfilled; row5 cols4-6:7,7,7 on what looks like a thick arm, turning it to marked when expected probably keeps as1 like ex3's main body; row7 col3:7 on edge ok, but row8 col4:0 vs expected? possibly a gap but overpropagates to row8 cols11-13:7,7,7 internal); large empty right side (cols14-15 all0) unmarked ok, but left border1s (cols0-4) mostly preserved except scattered7s (e.g., row11 col5:7 ok for gap, but row12 col8:7? may be extra). It makes partial sense for marking small gaps/protrusions (e.g., row2-3 small7 cluster near center), but fails on subtlety of not marking solid cores—similar to ex3 overmarking—suggesting needs better gap size limits and vertical checks; without expected, it visually disrupts the shape more than highlights defects.

[2025-10-01 20:34:18] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 20:35:16] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties (e.g., position, pixel count, holes, bbox) that directly affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way. Only elements with clear, shared interactions are included; isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., standalone single-pixel Blues without clear overlap or transformation) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation is provided. Where a transformation cannot be precisely explained, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Position (bbox) of Input Blue → Position (bbox) of Output Dark Red**
   - Input Blue bboxes consistently contain or fully encompass the bboxes of all output Dark Red elements.
     - Train 1: All Dark Red bboxes ([2,0,4,1], [15,1,16,3], [7,3,9,5], [4,9,7,12], [13,16,15,18]) are nested within input Blue bboxes ([0,0,16,4], [0,9,16,14], [0,17,16,18]).
     - Train 2: All Dark Red bboxes ([14,0,15,1], [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14]) are nested within input Blue bboxes ([0,0,15,15]).
     - Train 3: All Dark Red bboxes ([9,5,12,8], [6,11,8,13]) are nested within input Blue bbox ([4,3,13,12]).
   - Effect: Dark Red positions are derived from or restricted to input Blue positions; no Dark Red appears outside any input Blue bbox.
   - No reverse effect (output Dark Red position does not alter input Blue position).

#### 2. **Pixel Count of Input Blue → Pixel Count of Output Blue + Pixel Count of Output Dark Red**
   - Pixel count of each input Blue component is consistently reduced in the corresponding output Blue component(s), with the reduction approximately equal to the total pixel count of all overlapping/nested Dark Red components.
     - Train 1: Top input Blue (82 pixels) → output Blue (67 pixels) + nested Dark Red (5 + 5 + ~3 partial overlap from 8 = ~13 total), reduction ~15 (close match, minor discrepancy on partial bbox overlap). Middle input (83 pixels) → output Blue (70 pixels) + nested Dark Red (12 pixels), reduction 13 (close match). Bottom input (33 pixels) → output Blues (26 + 2 = 28 pixels) + nested Dark Red (8 pixels, partial), reduction ~5 (close match).
     - Train 2: Small input Blue (29 pixels) → output Blue (21 pixels) + nested Dark Red (8 pixels), reduction 8 (exact match). Large input (164 pixels) → output Blue (139 pixels) + nested Dark Red (3 + 11 + 10 = 24 pixels), reduction 25 (close match, minor discrepancy possible on edge pixels).
     - Train 3: Middle input (88 pixels) → output Blue (70 pixels) + nested Dark Red (12 + 8 = 20 pixels), reduction 18 (close match, minor discrepancy on overlap edges).
   - Effect: Dark Red pixels "overwrite" or subtract from Blue pixels within shared bboxes; total pixels (Blue output + Dark Red) approximate input Blue pixels, indicating direct pixel-level interaction.
   - Note: Exact matches occur when Dark Red bboxes are fully internal; minor discrepancies (~1-2 pixels) are consistent when bboxes partially overlap band edges, but the subtraction pattern holds in every case.

#### 3. **Color of Input Blue → Color of Output Dark Red (Introduction/Transformation)**
   - All input elements are Blue; outputs consistently introduce Dark Red elements by transforming portions of input Blue areas (via position overlap, as in #1).
     - Train 1: Dark Red (total 5+5+8+12+8=38 pixels) derived from Blue areas.
     - Train 2: Dark Red (total 3+11+8+10=32 pixels) derived from Blue areas.
     - Train 3: Dark Red (total 12+8=20 pixels) derived from Blue areas.
   - Effect: Position-based overlap (from #1) triggers color change from Blue to Dark Red; no Dark Red without an overlapping input Blue.
   - Remaining Blue areas retain Blue color but with reduced pixels (as in #2).

#### 4. **Holes in Input Blue → Holes in Output Dark Red (Partial Correlation)**
   - When an input Blue has holes >0, at least one corresponding nested output Dark Red has holes=1 (indicating hole property transfer or filling).
     - Train 1: Middle input Blue (holes=1) → nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [7,3,9,5] and [4,9,7,12]).
     - Train 2: Small input Blue (holes=1) → nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [7,6,9,8]); large input (holes=3) → multiple nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14]).
     - Train 3: Middle input Blue (holes=2) → nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [6,11,8,13]).
   - Effect: Input holes >0 consistently lead to Dark Red with holes=1 in nested positions; higher input hole counts (2 or 3) result in multiple such Dark Red, but exact count mapping is unknown (e.g., 3 holes → 3 Dark Red with holes=1 in Train 2, but only 1 in Train 3 for 2 holes).
   - Note: Input Blues with holes=0 produce mixed Dark Red holes (0 or 1), so no consistent effect from holes=0. Output Blue holes are often reduced (1→0, 2→1, 3→1), but the reduction amount is unknown and not tied directly to Dark Red holes.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Connections
- **Holes in Input Blue → Holes in Output Blue**: Output Blue holes are reduced from input in cases with holes >0 (consistent direction), but the exact reduction rule (e.g., -1 or variable) cannot be explained and varies (1→0 in Train 1; 3→1 in Train 2; 2→1 in Train 3).
- **Single-pixel Input Blues (pixels=1, holes=0)**: These appear in every input but have no consistent interaction; they sometimes disappear without affecting output pixel counts or positions (e.g., [13,7,13,7] in Train 1, [4,8,4,8] in Train 2, [15,4,15,4] and [1,14,1,14] in Train 3), and no reliable link to specific Dark Red.
- **Bbox Dimensions (width/height) of Input Blue → Output Elements**: Output bboxes are smaller/nested, but no consistent scaling or transformation rule (e.g., halving or rotation) is observable across all examples.
- **Symmetry or Mirroring in Positions**: Background mentions symmetrical placements, but not consistently tied to specific properties (e.g., some Dark Red in corners/edges, but not every input position mirrors exactly).

These are the only connections that appear in every training example without variation. Test inputs follow similar Blue-only structure with holes and positions, but no outputs are provided for verification.

[2025-10-01 20:35:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)

def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the grid to remove isolated 1s and mark (with 7s) specific gap-filling or bridging patterns in horizontal and vertical directions, likely to highlight connected regions or paths while preserving the overall structure. The output transforms the input grid by setting certain 1s to 7s to indicate bridges over gaps of size 1 or 2, with rules considering adjacency, openness on sides, and interactions between rows/columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-directional neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't contribute to connected structures.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a row), mark the flanking 1s as 7s and propagate 7s to adjacent 1s above/below within the gap span; avoid bridging if both above and below the gap are fully zero in that span.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 2 (two 0s between two 1s), similar marking but with more complex conditions: bridge if below is all zeros or (all ones and above has a zero); propagate to adjacent rows only under specific all-zero/all-one conditions.
 * For vertical gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a column), mark flanking 1s as 7s and check left/right openness (if both open, propagate to adjacent 1s; if one side open and all-zero/all-one, bridge that side; otherwise, propagate to 1s on sides).
 * Subtlety: Propagation doesn't always fill entire adjacent rows/columns—only to 1s or under all-zero conditions; avoid over-marking closed sides.
 * Order of operations matters: apply isolated removal first, then horizontal handlers, then vertical, as changes can affect later detections.
 * Gaps must be detected without overlapping or skipping due to loop increments (e.g., j +=1 in size2 handler risks missing adjacent gaps).
 * Edge cases: Gaps at grid borders (e.g., open if at edge), multi-row interactions (e.g., don't bridge if sandwiched between zeros), and larger structures where gaps interact (e.g., L-shapes or corners may require vertical after horizontal).
 * No diagonal considerations—only 4-directional neighbors.
 * 7s seem to "infect" or highlight bridges but don't change 0s to 1s; preserve original 0s unless part of a bridge condition.
 * Potential for iterative application? Current code is single-pass per handler, but some expected outputs suggest multiple interactions (e.g., new gaps created by prior markings).

                    output[i][j] = 0
    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) partially understands gap bridging but fails all training examples, correctly removing some isolations (e.g., in train1 row 14, isolated 1 becomes 0) but missing many 7 placements.
 * In train1: Generated marks some horizontal bridges (e.g., row0 cols2/4 as 7s matching expected) and vertical in row4 col8/10, but misses vertical bridges in row11 (expected 7s at col4-6, generated all 1s or 0s) and row12 (expected full 7 bridge row5 cols4-7, generated plain 1s); also row16 expected has 7s at cols13-15 but generated all 0s—unknown why vertical handler skipped it, possibly due to prior horizontal changes or openness checks failing; row1 col16/17 has extra 7s not in expected.
 * In train2: Generated correctly handles some vertical gaps (e.g., row7 col13-15 as 7,0,7 matching) and horizontal in row12 (7s at cols5-8), but misses top-right vertical bridge (row0 col14=7, row1 col14/15=7,7 expected but generated 0,1,1); also row8 col14=1 expected but generated 1 (wait, minor); row9 col14=7 expected but 1; row14 col5=7 expected but 1, and row14 has no 7s at cols5-8 where expected full bridge—handler likely failed all-one condition or propagation.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly leaves a stray 1 at row3 col6 (should be removed as isolated, but remove_isolated missed it? Wait, it has neighbors? No, expected all 0 there); marks some 7s correctly (e.g., row5 col9-11), but over-marks or misses in row12 (7s at cols6-8 match, but row6 col11=7 generated vs expected 1? Minor diff); overall, vertical handler works for main structure but misses cleaning upper isolated 1.
 * Handlers for horizontal size1/size2 catch basic gaps but loop in size2 (j+=1) may skip overlapping gaps; vertical handler is overly complex with openness checks that fail edge cases (e.g., when both sides closed but should propagate minimally).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and mostly works but applied only once—may need re-application after bridging.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., connected components) attempted, which could help identify larger blobs with internal gaps; current pattern-matching is brittle for irregular shapes.
 * Function handle_vertical_size1 is broken/incomplete: logic for open_left/open_right has redundancy (e.g., else clause propagates regardless) and misses cases like train1 row16 where a horizontal gap below needs vertical tie-in; not fully helpful yet.
 * handle_horizontal_size2 has condition for all_one_below and has_zero_above, which worked in train2 row12 but failed train1 row12 (didn't create the full bridge).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense as it marks 7s in patterns resembling bridges (e.g., row4 cols4-6/11-13 as 7s for horizontal gaps, row7 col2-4 for vertical), and cleans some 0-regions, but looks incorrect overall due to inconsistencies like row8 col4=0 (likely a gap not bridged, but expected might fill based on train patterns) and over-marking in row10 (7s at col10-12/13? but test input has sparse 1s there—may be propagating too far).
 * Missing potential vertical bridges in left columns (e.g., rows3-13 col4 has 1s with 0s, generated some 7s but not continuous like train1 row12 expected full row); row12 has 7s at cols5-7 but then 0s, suggesting handler stopped prematurely—does not look correct as it leaves apparent gaps unbridged.
 * Extra 7s in row5 col13=7 where input is 1 but may not need marking (over-propagation?); top rows all 1s unchanged except edges, but test input has 0s in cols5+ which stay 0—plausible but likely misses horizontal size2 in row3-5 cols10-13.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates partial gap handling but fails to create cohesive structures (e.g., no full vertical bridges on right like train2), so it does not look correct—needs better propagation and iteration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions."""
    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)
```
This is helpful for consistent neighbor counting across steps.

```python

    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```
This is essential for isolating objects and could be used to process each blob independently, avoiding global errors.

                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                            hole.append((ni, nj))
                            if ni == 0 or ni == rows - 1 or nj == 0 or nj == cols - 1:
                                touches_border = True
                if not touches_border and len(hole) <= 2:
                    holes.append(hole)
    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing where isolated 1s are removed, background (connected to borders) is identified via flood fill, and then boundaries around enclosed "holes" (internal 0-regions surrounded by 1s) are marked by changing adjacent 1s to 7s, without altering background 0s or internal hole 0s. The goal is to highlight the edges of objects or shapes defined by 1s, treating enclosed 0s as holes and ignoring border-connected 0s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * First, remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal 1-neighbors) to clean up noise before identifying structures.
 * Use flood fill from border 0s to distinguish background 0s (connected to edges) from internal holes (enclosed 0s not reachable from borders); this is crucial to avoid marking background as part of holes.
 * For potential hole 0s, check orthogonal 1-neighbors with a threshold: 2 for border cells (to handle edge cases), 3 for internal cells (to ensure true enclosure); only proceed if threshold met.
 * Marking happens only on neighboring 1s (changed to 7s) for confirmed hole-adjacent 0s; do not mark 0s at all, even internal ones—7s are strictly for boundary 1s.
 * Use 8 directions for marking neighbors to capture diagonal boundaries, but count neighbors orthogonally (4 directions) for enclosure checks to avoid overcounting.
 * Subtlety: After removal and flood fill, use a fixed copy of the grid for counting neighbors to avoid modifying counts mid-process; process all 0s in original order.
 * Easy to miss: Do not mark background 0s or their neighbors as 7s, even if they have many 1-neighbors—this prevents "leaking" into exterior areas.
 * Another subtlety: Isolated 1s must be removed before flood fill, as they could block background propagation if not handled.
 * Border 0s should never trigger marking unless part of a shallow enclosure, but threshold helps filter.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects; process all independently.
 * No changes to 0s inside holes—they remain 0; only boundaries get 7s.
 * Potential issue: Stray 1s in output (e.g., not removed or incorrectly preserved) indicate removal step failure.
 * Consider grid size variations (e.g., 16x16, 17x17); ensure bounds checking in all loops.

                visited[i][j] = True

                visited[nx][ny] = True
                background.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return background
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this code) correctly removes isolated 1s in most cases but fails to remove some (e.g., stray 1 in training 1 row 14, column 8, which should be 0 in expected).
 * Flood fill for background works well, as most background 0s are untouched, but the marking step incorrectly sets neighboring background 0s to 7 when processing border-adjacent 0s with high 1-neighbor counts, leading to pollution (though not heavily visible in outputs).
 * Neighbor counting uses fixed_grid correctly, but marking loops over 8 directions and applies 7s to 1s properly for holes; however, the conditional "elif output[ni][nj] == 0 and is_bg" wrongly marks background 0-neighbors as 7, which may cause minor diffs.
 * Threshold (2 on border, 3 inside) is a good intuition for enclosure but over-marks in some shallow areas, e.g., in training 2 row 8, column 13 is 1 in generated but should be 1 (no change needed? wait, diff is in other spots like row 5 column 12: generated 1, expected 0? unclear, but mismatches exist).
 * In training 1, row 12 column 7 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected—likely a boundary 1 not marked because the adjacent 0 was misclassified as background or threshold not met.
 * In training 3, row 3 column 6 is 1 in generated but 0 in expected—indicates failure to remove an isolated 1 after step 1.
 * Processing order (all 0s after fixed_grid) is helpful but doesn't iterate to propagate marks; single pass misses chained boundaries.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., connected components for 1s) was attempted, which could help verify enclosures but isn't essential; the current approach is direct but buggy in marking conditions.
 * deepcopy is used well to avoid mutation issues.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The marking for background 0-neighbors (setting 0 to 7 if is_bg) is incorrect and should be removed entirely—it's not relevant and causes potential over-marking; don't use in future.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has extensive 7-marking on what appear to be boundaries around a large central structure, which looks plausible for enclosing holes (e.g., 7s outlining a blob in rows 3-12), but includes 7s on what might be background-adjacent 1s (e.g., top-left 1s unchanged, but some 0-regions in rows 2-3 have 7s that could be overreach).
 * It does not look fully correct: stray 0s inside potential holes (e.g., row 5 column 5=0, surrounded by 7s/1s) remain 0 as expected, but some boundary 1s like row 11 column 5=7 seem correct, yet the code's background-marking bug likely adds erroneous 7s in exterior areas (e.g., row 7 column 4=0 should stay 0, but if processed as bg, neighbors might be hit—output shows 7s nearby).
 * Missing: No isolated 1 removal visible, but test input has clean 1-structures; however, the output has unbroken 1-chains where 7s should split boundaries (e.g., row 4 columns 10-12=7,0,7 looks like hole marking, but compare mentally: input has 0s in top-right, likely background, so no 7s there—generated has them, indicating over-marking).
 * To handle test: Ensure marking only triggers for non-background 0s, and use stricter enclosure (e.g., confirm full surround); generated has too many 7s in potentially open areas (rows 0-1 all 1s/0s, but row 2 has 7s that might belong to internal hole only).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving binary image processing, where the goal is to preprocess a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/shape pixels) by removing noise like thin protrusions, identifying true background vs. internal holes, marking boundaries or edges of shapes with 7s (likely to highlight contours or fill shallow features), handling specific hole types (shallow internal ones to fill/mark, deeper ones to leave), and distinguishing external dents from internal features without over-marking or misclassifying regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules: Start by cleaning the grid (e.g., remove isolated or thinly connected 1s with <2 neighbors to eliminate noise/protrusions). Identify background as all 0s connected to the grid borders via flood fill (BFS/DFS from border 0s), treating internal enclosed 0s as holes. Mark 1s adjacent (8-directional) to internal (non-background) 0s as boundaries with 7 to highlight shape edges or holes. Fill or mark "shallow" holes—defined as internal 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) but with an "open" direction leading to background or edge—by setting the hole to 7, thinning adjacent walls to 0 if needed, and propagating marks to nearby regions (e.g., perpendicular sides or outer patches). For external dents (background 0s with >=2 adjacent 1s or exactly 3 neighbors), mark adjacent 1s as 7 without filling the dent itself, and extend marks horizontally/vertically if the dent opens to background.
 * Subtleties: Background flood fill must avoid marking internal holes as background; use visited array and only seed from border 0s. Shallow holes require checking "opposing" directions (e.g., if a wall 1 leads outward to background, fill the hole and mark/thin accordingly), but avoid over-filling deeper holes (e.g., those not directly open). External dents should not propagate marks into internal areas; use 4-directional for neighbor counts but 8 for adjacency checks. Thin protrusions are only removed if they have <2 1-neighbors (isolated or diagonal-only connections don't count as connected). Order matters: clean protrusions first, then background ID, then hole handling, then boundary marking, then dents—misordering can cascade errors (e.g., marking before cleaning leaves noise). 7s seem to represent "marked/filled boundary" but should not overwrite 1s unless thinning; avoid setting background 0s to 7 except in specific fills. Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; process all uniformly. Edge cases: fully enclosed shapes, 1-pixel holes/protrusions, diagonal connections (use 4-dir for connectivity, 8 for adjacency), and border-touching holes (treat as external/not shallow).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction needed (grids are small, process in-place); focus on topological features like connectivity and depth. Iterations may be needed for multi-layer holes, but single pass seems sufficient. Directions: 4-dir for orthogonal connectivity (e.g., neighbor counts for thinness/holes), 8-dir for boundary adjacency to catch diagonals. Outputs must preserve original 1/0 structure except for targeted 7 marks/fills—over-marking turns valid shapes into boundaries. Unknowns: Exact depth threshold for "shallow" (code assumes 1-layer, but may need recursion); why some expected 0s stay 0 while adjacent 1s get 7 (e.g., deep holes untouched).

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `handle_shallow_holes`: Overly complex and buggy—tries to fill 0s with 4 1-neighbors by checking "open" directions and propagating marks, but misfires (e.g., sets wrong outer patches to 7, thins incorrectly, marks perpendicular sides prematurely). Fills background-adjacent areas and creates artifacts; not handling depth properly leads to over-filling.
- `handle_external_dents`: Marks background 0s with >=2 or ==3 1-neighbors by setting adjacent 1s to 7 and extending horizontally/vertically, but propagates into internal regions and doesn't distinguish dent "openness" well (e.g., marks valid external 1s as boundaries). Condition for num_adj==3 assumes single open dir but fails on corners/diagonals; broken for multi-dent shapes.
- `is_on_border`: Unused in main program; simplistic (only checks edges) and not needed since background flood fill handles borders implicitly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in hole/dent handling despite good background ID and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated over-marks top-left 7s (e.g., row 0 cols 2-4 as 7,7,7 vs. expected 7,0,7; row 2 col 16 as 7 vs. 0) and adds extra 7s in bottom shapes (e.g., row 17 col 14 as 0,7,1 vs. expected 7,0,7,1—flipped hole mark); also fills row 5 entirely with 7s where expected has sparse 7s and 0s. What worked: Correctly identified some internal boundaries (e.g., row 1 cols 14-16 as 7,7). What didn't: Shallow hole logic filled external dents as internal and propagated wrongly (unknown why row 5 over-filled, possibly background mis-ID).
 * Train 2: Generated marks entire top/middle as 7s (e.g., row 2 all 7s vs. expected all 1s; row 3 cols 1-13 as 7,0s vs. expected 1,0s) and adds spurious 7s in bottom hole (e.g., row 7 col 9 as 0 vs. expected 0, but surrounds wrong). What worked: Some external dent marking (e.g., row 15 all 1s correct). What didn't: Boundary marking over-applied to non-hole areas; thin protrusion removal missed large 0-regions, treating them as shallow holes (unknown cascade from order).
 * Train 3: Generated adds outer 7-frame around shape (e.g., row 3 cols 3-15 as 7s vs. expected 0s; row 4 col 3 as 7 vs. 0) and over-marks internals (e.g., row 6 col 11 as 0 vs. expected 0, but adjacent 7s wrong). What worked: Some internal hole boundaries marked (e.g., row 6 cols 9-11 as 7,0,7 matching expected). What didn't: Dent handling marked border-adjacent 1s as 7 prematurely; protrusion removal insufficient, leaving stubs that triggered false boundaries.
 * Overall: Background flood fill works (correct in isolated tests, avoids internals). Neighbor counting solid. But handling functions broken—shallow fills propagate to background, dents mark too broadly, no iteration for multi-step cleans. No object extraction attempted (not needed, as global processing suffices). Program order exposes cleaned grid to flawed handlers, causing 7-overload.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s in ways inconsistent with training expectations, such as filling large internal regions (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 6-12 as all 7s, likely a mis-filled "hole" that's actually shape body) and adding spurious 0s/7s in bottom (e.g., row 11 cols 11-13 as 7,7,7 vs. probable need for sparser boundaries). External edges have inconsistent thinning (e.g., row 0 col 5 as 7,0s vs. expected clean 1s or marked only at dents). It resembles training failures: background ID probably correct, but shallow/dent logic cascades to mark valid 1s as 7 and leave deep holes unmarked. To fix for test: Refine shallow check to require explicit "outer open" to background (not just edge), limit propagation to 1-step, and apply dent marking only after all internals—test has complex nested shapes (e.g., central 1s with 0-dents), so need better depth (e.g., distance from background >1 for internal).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing binary grids (0s and 1s representing empty space and filled shapes/objects) to clean up irregular features like thin protrusions, identify and mark small gaps or runs of 0s (possibly "cracks" or "holes" in shapes), and highlight adjacent areas using 7s, likely to emphasize boundaries, small defects, or connectable gaps without altering the core structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents shapes or "blobs" of 1s surrounded by 0s; the goal is to preserve main shapes while removing or marking minor irregularities like thin lines (protrusions with <2 neighbors) and small 0-runs (<=2 consecutive 0s in rows, possibly indicating narrow gaps).
 * 7s are used to "mark" or highlight specific 1s adjacent (using 8 directions) to small 0-runs, but only if they touch the run; overmarking internal 1s as 7s (e.g., solid blocks) is incorrect, as seen in examples where expected output keeps core 1s unchanged.
 * Single 0-gaps between 1s in rows should trigger marking of nearby 0s above/below (if they form a small empty area of 3 consecutive 0s), but only if flanked by 1s; this seems aimed at filling or noting bridgeable gaps, but must not propagate to larger empty areas or alter non-gap 1s.
 * Cleaning must be iterative and only remove isolated/thin 1s (<2 orthogonal neighbors), but stop before eroding main shapes; subtle: use 4 directions for cleaning to avoid diagonal erosion, but 8 for marking to catch diagonal adjacencies.
 * Grids have borders of 0s or 1s in some cases (e.g., full rows of 1s or 0s); do not mark border 1s unless they directly border small internal 0-runs.
 * Subtle elements: Small 0-runs are row-specific (horizontal only in current code), but may need vertical/hole detection; avoid marking in large empty areas (runs >2); 7s should not replace 0s in core empty spaces or create new 1s—only overlay on existing 1s or specific 0s.
 * Order matters: Clean protrusions first, then fill/mark gaps on the cleaned grid; running marking before cleaning can propagate errors.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-cell gaps vs. protrusions; diagonal connections shouldn't trigger cleaning but may for marking; no global connectivity (e.g., flood fill) yet, but may be needed to distinguish separate objects.
 * Across attempts: No object extraction yet, but shapes seem like letters/symbols (e.g., ex2 looks like a figure with arms/legs); 7s highlight "defects" like small holes or thin parts without removing them.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly handles training example 1, preserving a clean shape with appropriate 7s on small edge gaps.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated overmarks some 1s as 7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs expected1; row5 col13:7 vs1; row6 col12:0 but marks surrounding as7 incorrectly; row8 col13:7 vs0? Wait, expected has1 there but generated7; row9 col13:1 vs0—mismatch); under-marks others (e.g., row6 col12 should be1 but generated0, missing7 nearby); fill_single_gaps marks too aggressively in vertical gaps, turning solid1s into7s; mark_small_zero_runs catches horizontal runs<=2 but misses vertical/diagonal contexts, leading to extra7s in row7-9 cols7-10.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated over-erodes or over-marks core1s as7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs1; row5 col9-11:7,7,7 vs1,1,1; row6 col11:7 vs7? but row6 col12:7 vs0 mismatch; row7 col11:0 vs0 ok but surrounding7s extra; row8 col10:1 vs1 ok but row8 col11-12:7,7 vs7,7 ok—partial; row12 col6-8:7,7,7 vs7,7,7 ok); cleaning removes too little (shape intact but marking turns internal "thick" parts to7s); fill_single_gaps incorrectly fills non-single gaps or propagates to borders.
 * clean_thin_protrusions is helpful and correct for ex1 (removes isolates without harming main blob), but may not handle "thin but connected" arms in ex2/ex3 (e.g., doesn't remove enough in vertical thin parts).
 * mark_small_zero_runs is partially helpful for horizontal small gaps but broken for overmarking (uses8-dir on any adjacent1, hitting internals; should check if1 is "edge" or limit to run ends); doesn't handle vertical runs.
 * fill_single_gaps is unhelpful/broken: Only checks horizontal single0s flanked by1s, then marks3-wide0s above/below if all0—but in ex2/ex3, this creates extra7s in larger empty areas (e.g., ex3 row5-6 gaps marked wrongly); doesn't fill the gap itself (sets output on0s to7, but expected keeps some0s); ignores vertical singles; not relevant if puzzle is about marking borders, not filling.
 * No object extraction function yet, but needed for future: Separate blobs to process independently (e.g., via flood fill) to avoid cross-marking; current code treats whole grid as one, causing issues in multi-object grids like ex3 (multiple shapes?).
 * Overall: Core cleaning works (ex1 pass), but marking logic misses subtlety of "small defects only" (overmarks thick/internal1s); no vertical gap detection; order of fill/mark causes propagation errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it overmarks internal and thick parts of the main shape with7s (e.g., row3 cols10-12:7,7,7 seem like marking a small horizontal0-run above, but expected likely keeps core1s as1s per ex2/ex3 patterns; row4 col11:0 isolated but surrounded by7s—may be underfilled; row5 cols4-6:7,7,7 on what looks like a thick arm, turning it to marked when expected probably keeps as1 like ex3's main body; row7 col3:7 on edge ok, but row8 col4:0 vs expected? possibly a gap but overpropagates to row8 cols11-13:7,7,7 internal); large empty right side (cols14-15 all0) unmarked ok, but left border1s (cols0-4) mostly preserved except scattered7s (e.g., row11 col5:7 ok for gap, but row12 col8:7? may be extra). It makes partial sense for marking small gaps/protrusions (e.g., row2-3 small7 cluster near center), but fails on subtlety of not marking solid cores—similar to ex3 overmarking—suggesting needs better gap size limits and vertical checks; without expected, it visually disrupts the shape more than highlights defects.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties (e.g., position, pixel count, holes, bbox) that directly affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way. Only elements with clear, shared interactions are included; isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., standalone single-pixel Blues without clear overlap or transformation) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation is provided. Where a transformation cannot be precisely explained, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Position (bbox) of Input Blue → Position (bbox) of Output Dark Red**
   - Input Blue bboxes consistently contain or fully encompass the bboxes of all output Dark Red elements.
     - Train 1: All Dark Red bboxes ([2,0,4,1], [15,1,16,3], [7,3,9,5], [4,9,7,12], [13,16,15,18]) are nested within input Blue bboxes ([0,0,16,4], [0,9,16,14], [0,17,16,18]).
     - Train 2: All Dark Red bboxes ([14,0,15,1], [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14]) are nested within input Blue bboxes ([0,0,15,15]).
     - Train 3: All Dark Red bboxes ([9,5,12,8], [6,11,8,13]) are nested within input Blue bbox ([4,3,13,12]).
   - Effect: Dark Red positions are derived from or restricted to input Blue positions; no Dark Red appears outside any input Blue bbox.
   - No reverse effect (output Dark Red position does not alter input Blue position).

#### 2. **Pixel Count of Input Blue → Pixel Count of Output Blue + Pixel Count of Output Dark Red**
   - Pixel count of each input Blue component is consistently reduced in the corresponding output Blue component(s), with the reduction approximately equal to the total pixel count of all overlapping/nested Dark Red components.
     - Train 1: Top input Blue (82 pixels) → output Blue (67 pixels) + nested Dark Red (5 + 5 + ~3 partial overlap from 8 = ~13 total), reduction ~15 (close match, minor discrepancy on partial bbox overlap). Middle input (83 pixels) → output Blue (70 pixels) + nested Dark Red (12 pixels), reduction 13 (close match). Bottom input (33 pixels) → output Blues (26 + 2 = 28 pixels) + nested Dark Red (8 pixels, partial), reduction ~5 (close match).
     - Train 2: Small input Blue (29 pixels) → output Blue (21 pixels) + nested Dark Red (8 pixels), reduction 8 (exact match). Large input (164 pixels) → output Blue (139 pixels) + nested Dark Red (3 + 11 + 10 = 24 pixels), reduction 25 (close match, minor discrepancy possible on edge pixels).
     - Train 3: Middle input (88 pixels) → output Blue (70 pixels) + nested Dark Red (12 + 8 = 20 pixels), reduction 18 (close match, minor discrepancy on overlap edges).
   - Effect: Dark Red pixels "overwrite" or subtract from Blue pixels within shared bboxes; total pixels (Blue output + Dark Red) approximate input Blue pixels, indicating direct pixel-level interaction.
   - Note: Exact matches occur when Dark Red bboxes are fully internal; minor discrepancies (~1-2 pixels) are consistent when bboxes partially overlap band edges, but the subtraction pattern holds in every case.

#### 3. **Color of Input Blue → Color of Output Dark Red (Introduction/Transformation)**
   - All input elements are Blue; outputs consistently introduce Dark Red elements by transforming portions of input Blue areas (via position overlap, as in #1).
     - Train 1: Dark Red (total 5+5+8+12+8=38 pixels) derived from Blue areas.
     - Train 2: Dark Red (total 3+11+8+10=32 pixels) derived from Blue areas.
     - Train 3: Dark Red (total 12+8=20 pixels) derived from Blue areas.
   - Effect: Position-based overlap (from #1) triggers color change from Blue to Dark Red; no Dark Red without an overlapping input Blue.
   - Remaining Blue areas retain Blue color but with reduced pixels (as in #2).

#### 4. **Holes in Input Blue → Holes in Output Dark Red (Partial Correlation)**
   - When an input Blue has holes >0, at least one corresponding nested output Dark Red has holes=1 (indicating hole property transfer or filling).
     - Train 1: Middle input Blue (holes=1) → nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [7,3,9,5] and [4,9,7,12]).
     - Train 2: Small input Blue (holes=1) → nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [7,6,9,8]); large input (holes=3) → multiple nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14]).
     - Train 3: Middle input Blue (holes=2) → nested Dark Red (holes=1 for [6,11,8,13]).
   - Effect: Input holes >0 consistently lead to Dark Red with holes=1 in nested positions; higher input hole counts (2 or 3) result in multiple such Dark Red, but exact count mapping is unknown (e.g., 3 holes → 3 Dark Red with holes=1 in Train 2, but only 1 in Train 3 for 2 holes).
   - Note: Input Blues with holes=0 produce mixed Dark Red holes (0 or 1), so no consistent effect from holes=0. Output Blue holes are often reduced (1→0, 2→1, 3→1), but the reduction amount is unknown and not tied directly to Dark Red holes.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Connections
- **Holes in Input Blue → Holes in Output Blue**: Output Blue holes are reduced from input in cases with holes >0 (consistent direction), but the exact reduction rule (e.g., -1 or variable) cannot be explained and varies (1→0 in Train 1; 3→1 in Train 2; 2→1 in Train 3).
- **Single-pixel Input Blues (pixels=1, holes=0)**: These appear in every input but have no consistent interaction; they sometimes disappear without affecting output pixel counts or positions (e.g., [13,7,13,7] in Train 1, [4,8,4,8] in Train 2, [15,4,15,4] and [1,14,1,14] in Train 3), and no reliable link to specific Dark Red.
- **Bbox Dimensions (width/height) of Input Blue → Output Elements**: Output bboxes are smaller/nested, but no consistent scaling or transformation rule (e.g., halving or rotation) is observable across all examples.
- **Symmetry or Mirroring in Positions**: Background mentions symmetrical placements, but not consistently tied to specific properties (e.g., some Dark Red in corners/edges, but not every input position mirrors exactly).

These are the only connections that appear in every training example without variation. Test inputs follow similar Blue-only structure with holes and positions, but no outputs are provided for verification.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:41:02] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a binary grid (0s for empty/background, 1s for filled pixels, likely representing shapes or blobs in a larger image) to simulate some kind of boundary detection, gap-filling, or shape refinement rule. The goal is to output a modified grid where isolated 1s are removed (set to 0), small gaps (size 1 or 2, horizontal or vertical) in connected 1-regions are "bridged" by marking the flanking 1s (and sometimes the gap itself) with 7s to indicate boundaries or connections, and these 7 markings propagate to adjacent rows/columns only if those segments are uniform (all 1s or all 0s), with multiple passes to handle interactions between horizontal and vertical directions; the result highlights structure while preserving the overall shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-connected 1-neighbors) as single-pixel "Blues" or noise disappear; this happens first and is straightforward.
 * Gap-bridging: For horizontal/vertical gaps of size 1 or 2 between 1s, mark the flanking 1s with 7 (to denote boundaries or connections), but do not fill the gap with 1s—keep it as 0s; this is not true filling but marking edges for visual emphasis.
 * Edge cases: Handle gaps at grid edges (left/right for horizontal, top/bottom for vertical) separately, as they lack one side; e.g., a size-1 gap at left edge (0 followed by 1) marks the adjacent 1 as 7.
 * Propagation subtlety: After marking 7s for a gap, propagate to adjacent rows (for horizontal gaps) or columns (for vertical gaps) only over the exact segment length (e.g., 3 cells for size-1 gap, 4 for size-2), and only if that segment is uniform (all 1s or all 0s in the original values); this prevents over-marking mixed areas and simulates "uniform extension" of boundaries.
 * Multiple passes: Apply horizontal gap handling, then vertical, then repeat (at least once) to catch interactions, like a horizontal gap creating a vertical one or vice versa; without passes, some markings miss.
 * Directions: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for neighbor counting, but gap detection is strictly linear (row-wise for horizontal, column-wise for vertical).
 * No diagonal handling: Gaps and propagation are axis-aligned only; no 8-connected or diagonal propagation, which could explain some missed connections.
 * Uniformity check: For propagation, use "all(v == 1) or all(v == 0)" or equivalent (len(set(vals)) == 1); this is key to avoid marking non-uniform areas, but it's easy to miss that 7s already present might break uniformity if not handled carefully.
 * Grid size variations: Grids are rectangular but not always square; handle empty or small grids gracefully; examples vary from 16x16 to 16x17-ish.
 * Subtle over-marking risk: Propagation can chain incorrectly if not using copies or if passes over-apply; e.g., a marked 7 in an adjacent row might then trigger further gaps.
 * No object extraction needed: While connected components might help identify blobs, the rules seem local (per row/column), not global; attempting full object extraction (e.g., flood-fill) could be overkill or unhelpful here.
 * 7 as marker only: 7s do not count as 1s for neighbor counting or uniformity (treat as distinct); final output keeps 0s, 1s, and 7s without converting back.
 * Isolated after marking: Removals happen only at start; later 1s aren't re-checked for isolation, even if markings isolate them.
 * Potential missed rules: Some examples suggest vertical gaps might propagate differently (e.g., in train 2, expected has 1s where generated has 7s, possibly no marking in certain blob interiors); horizontal size-2 might not always propagate fully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
```
(This defines 4-connected directions, useful for neighbor counting; essential for isolation check.)

```python
def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions. Handles observation of isolated cells."""
    count = 0
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] in target_values:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is helpful and correct for checking 1-neighbors; used in isolation removal; could extend to other counts if needed.)

```python
def remove_isolated(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove 1s with zero 4-connected 1-neighbors (isolated pixels). Based on observation that single-pixel Blues disappear."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if new_grid[i][j] == 1 and count_neighbors(new_grid, i, j, rows, cols, directions_4, (1,)) == 0:
                new_grid[i][j] = 0
    return new_grid
```
(This works well; correctly removes isolates without side effects; apply first in main program.)

(The gap-handling functions like handle_horizontal_size1_gaps, handle_vertical_gaps, etc., are partially helpful as they detect gaps correctly but over-propagate 7s due to uniformity checks or pass ordering; the composition in handle_horizontal_gaps and multiple passes in program() are good ideas but buggy in execution. Edge handlers like handle_horizontal_edge_gaps are useful for boundaries but need tighter uniformity checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly removes isolated 1s in all examples (no differences noted in isolates).
 * Gap detection works for many size-1 and size-2 cases, e.g., in train 1 rows 0-5 and 9-13, most 7s match expected positions.
 * Multiple passes (horiz then vert then repeat) capture some interactions, like propagating across directions.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly matches but differs in row 11 (pos 5: 7 vs expected 0, over-marked during vertical propagation?); row 14 (pos 8: 7 vs all 0s, spurious propagation from above); row 17 (pos 8: 7 vs 1, and pos 13: 7 vs 1? Wait, expected has 7 at 13 but generated has it early—mismatch in horizontal gap detection); reason unknown but likely over-propagation in vertical_size1_gaps.
 * Train 2: Major mismatches, e.g., row 2: generated has 7s at pos 1-2 vs expected 1s (failed to skip interior uniform 1s?); row 5: generated 7s at pos 6-12 vs expected 1s (over-marked a non-gap area as gap); row 6: generated 1 at pos 6 vs expected 1, but 7s propagate wrongly; row 8: pos 13: 7 vs expected 1 (extra marking); suggests propagation condition too loose, marking uniform 1-blocks incorrectly.
 * Train 3: Minor mismatches, e.g., row 3: generated has 1 at pos 6 vs expected 0 (failed to remove a near-isolate?); row 6: pos 12: 7 vs expected 7, but pos 11: 0 vs 7? Wait, generated [...,7,0,7,...] expected [...,0,7,7,...]—shifted 7 placement; row 7: pos 12: 0 vs 7; likely edge in vertical gap handling misaligns.
 * Function `handle_horizontal_size2_gaps` and similar are helpful for detection but broken in propagation (applies to non-gaps or over-uniform checks); don't use without fixing uniformity to strictly original values before marking.
 * No object extraction function present, but not needed—local row/column scans suffice; adding flood-fill would be unhelpful and complicate.
 * Overall, isolation and basic gap marking work (partial understanding), but propagation over-marks interiors and misses exact uniformity, causing all trains to fail.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-marks with 7s in ways that don't align with expected patterns from trainings (e.g., row 2 has 7s at pos 10-12, but if this is a gap, propagation to row 3 seems excessive with 7 at pos 11; row 8 has 7s spreading horizontally where a vertical gap might not warrant it).
 * It misses potential vertical gap bridging in cols 5-7 (e.g., row 0-1 are 0s, but row 2 has 0s—should mark flanking if size-2, but instead marks unrelated areas like row 9 pos 11).
 * Extra 7s in row 10 (pos 5-7) look like over-propagation from a horizontal gap, similar to train failures; the output fragments the main blob with unnecessary 7s (e.g., row 4 pos 4-6: 7s where expected might keep 1s for uniformity).
 * To handle test, need stricter propagation (only if adjacent segment exactly matches the gap's flanking pattern, not just uniform) and more passes or reverse-order application to avoid chaining errors.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns that hold across all cases, such as color affecting structure, position influencing color or splitting, hole count linking to pixel redistribution, and spatial overlaps driving changes. No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving attempts are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background regions without direct ties to other components) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear links (e.g., exact mirroring direction, precise hole reduction amounts) are noted as unknown rather than forced.

   - **Description**: Parts of input Blue components consistently transform to Dark Red in output where there is direct spatial overlap between the input Blue bounding box (bbox) and new Dark Red bbox. The remaining non-overlapping Blue parts retain Blue color but with reduced pixels.
   - **Properties Involved**: Color (Blue → Dark Red), position (bbox overlap), pixel count (transfer from Blue to Dark Red).
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input Blue [0,9,16,14] overlaps output Dark Red [4,9,7,12] and [7,3,9,5] (partial y-overlap with adjacent input [0,0,16,4]); Blue pixels drop from 83 to 70, with Dark Red gaining 12 + 8.
     - Train 2: Input Blue [6,5,11,9] overlaps output Dark Red [7,6,9,8] and [13,5,15,9] (adjacent extension); Blue pixels drop from 29 to 21, Dark Red gains 8 + 11.
     - Train 3: Input Blue [4,3,13,12] overlaps output Dark Red [9,5,12,8] and [6,11,8,13]; Blue pixels drop from 88 to 70, Dark Red gains 12 + 8.
   - **Effect**: Overlapping regions cause color change and pixel redistribution; non-overlapping Blue regions stay intact but lose pixels to the shift.
   - **Unknown**: Exact trigger for which subregions overlap (e.g., no consistent edge/corner rule identifiable).

#### 2. **Hole Count Interaction: Input Holes Affect Output Dark Red Hole Creation and Blue Hole Reduction**
   - **Description**: Input Blue components with holes (>0) consistently result in output Dark Red components gaining holes=1, while the corresponding output Blue part has reduced (or equal) hole count. Components with 0 input holes do not spawn holed Dark Red.
   - **Properties Involved**: Hole count (input → output redistribution), color (tied to hole presence for Dark Red emergence).
   - **Consistency Across Examples** (only for holed input components):
     - Train 1: Input Blue holes=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → output Blue holes=0 (reduced) + Dark Red holes=1 ([4,9,7,12]).
     - Train 2: Input Blue holes=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → output Blue holes=1 (equal) + Dark Red holes=1 ([13,5,15,9] and [7,6,9,8]); input holes=3 ([0,0,15,15]) → output Blue holes=1 (reduced) + Dark Red holes=1 ([5,12,8,14]).
     - Train 3: Input Blue holes=2 ([4,3,13,12]) → output Blue holes=1 (reduced) + Dark Red holes=1 ([6,11,8,13]); another Dark Red holes=2 (possibly aggregated from input holes).
   - **Effect**: Holes in input Blue "transfer" to create holed Dark Red components, reducing burden on remaining Blue (consistent reduction or stabilization of holes in Blue).
   - **Unknown**: How multiple input holes aggregate (e.g., why Train 3 has one Dark Red with holes=2); not all reductions are by exactly 1.

#### 3. **Position Interaction: Small 1x1 Input Pixels Affect Nearby Output Dark Red Positioning and Size**
   - **Description**: Input 1x1 Blue pixels (holes=0, pixels=1) consistently interact with adjacent or extended positions in output, causing small Dark Red components to form nearby or at shifted positions (often rightward or edge-adjacent), with the input pixel itself disappearing (no 1x1 Blue remains).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (input pixel location → output Dark Red bbox shift), size (1 pixel → small multi-pixel Dark Red), color (Blue pixel → Dark Red structure).
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input 1x1 at [13,7] (near-right) → output small Dark Red [15,1,16,3] (right-shifted, pixels=5) and [13,16,15,18] (y-shifted, pixels=8); input [3,15] (left-bottom) → partial tie to [2,0,4,1] (left-top shift, pixels=5).
     - Train 2: Input 1x1 at [4,8] (left-middle) → output small Dark Red [14,0,15,1] (right-top shift, pixels=3); also influences adjacent [13,5,15,9] extension (rightward from input position).
     - Train 3: Input 1x1 at [15,4] (right) and [1,14] (left-bottom) → output Dark Red [9,5,12,8] (central from right input) and [6,11,8,13] (central from left input), both small-ish (pixels=12 and 8).
   - **Effect**: Input 1x1 position "seeds" a Dark Red component at a transformed position (consistent shift pattern toward edges/centers), absorbing the pixel into a larger structure.
   - **Unknown**: Exact transformation rule for position shift (e.g., consistent horizontal/vertical mirroring not identifiable; varies slightly per example).

#### 4. **Pixel Count Interaction: Overall Pixel Conservation with Color-Based Redistribution**
   - **Description**: Total pixels from all input Blue components are consistently redistributed to output Blue + Dark Red components, with no net loss/gain beyond minor variances (~1-3 pixels, possibly due to connection thresholds). Dark Red always gains pixels from Blue reductions.
   - **Properties Involved**: Pixel count (input total → output split by color), color (Blue retains majority, Dark Red takes subsets).
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input total ~200 → output total ~203 (Blue: 67+70+26+2=165; Dark Red: 5+5+8+12+8=38).
     - Train 2: Input total ~194 → output total ~189 (Blue: 21+139=160; Dark Red: 3+11+8+10=32). Slight variance, but redistribution holds.
     - Train 3: Input total ~90 → output total ~90 (Blue: 70; Dark Red: 12+8=20).
   - **Effect**: Pixels "move" from Blue to Dark Red via the above spatial/hole interactions, preserving mass but altering color distribution.
   - **Unknown**: Source of minor pixel variances (e.g., not tied to a specific property like edges).

No other interactions (e.g., silhouette/edge effects on movement, specific shape transformations like L-shapes to colors) were consistently identifiable across all examples without forcing unrelated ties. Test inputs were not analyzed for interactions, as they lack outputs for comparison.

[2025-10-01 20:42:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions

def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the grid to remove isolated 1s and mark (with 7s) specific gap-filling or bridging patterns in horizontal and vertical directions, likely to highlight connected regions or paths while preserving the overall structure. The output transforms the input grid by setting certain 1s to 7s to indicate bridges over gaps of size 1 or 2, with rules considering adjacency, openness on sides, and interactions between rows/columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-directional neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't contribute to connected structures.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a row), mark the flanking 1s as 7s and propagate 7s to adjacent 1s above/below within the gap span; avoid bridging if both above and below the gap are fully zero in that span.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 2 (two 0s between two 1s), similar marking but with more complex conditions: bridge if below is all zeros or (all ones and above has a zero); propagate to adjacent rows only under specific all-zero/all-one conditions.
 * For vertical gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a column), mark flanking 1s as 7s and check left/right openness (if both open, propagate to adjacent 1s; if one side open and all-zero/all-one, bridge that side; otherwise, propagate to 1s on sides).
 * Subtlety: Propagation doesn't always fill entire adjacent rows/columns—only to 1s or under all-zero conditions; avoid over-marking closed sides.
 * Order of operations matters: apply isolated removal first, then horizontal handlers, then vertical, as changes can affect later detections.
 * Gaps must be detected without overlapping or skipping due to loop increments (e.g., j +=1 in size2 handler risks missing adjacent gaps).
 * Edge cases: Gaps at grid borders (e.g., open if at edge), multi-row interactions (e.g., don't bridge if sandwiched between zeros), and larger structures where gaps interact (e.g., L-shapes or corners may require vertical after horizontal).
 * No diagonal considerations—only 4-directional neighbors.
 * 7s seem to "infect" or highlight bridges but don't change 0s to 1s; preserve original 0s unless part of a bridge condition.
 * Potential for iterative application? Current code is single-pass per handler, but some expected outputs suggest multiple interactions (e.g., new gaps created by prior markings).

                if n == 0:
                    output[i][j] = 0
    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) partially understands gap bridging but fails all training examples, correctly removing some isolations (e.g., in train1 row 14, isolated 1 becomes 0) but missing many 7 placements.
 * In train1: Generated marks some horizontal bridges (e.g., row0 cols2/4 as 7s matching expected) and vertical in row4 col8/10, but misses vertical bridges in row11 (expected 7s at col4-6, generated all 1s or 0s) and row12 (expected full 7 bridge row5 cols4-7, generated plain 1s); also row16 expected has 7s at cols13-15 but generated all 0s—unknown why vertical handler skipped it, possibly due to prior horizontal changes or openness checks failing; row1 col16/17 has extra 7s not in expected.
 * In train2: Generated correctly handles some vertical gaps (e.g., row7 col13-15 as 7,0,7 matching) and horizontal in row12 (7s at cols5-8), but misses top-right vertical bridge (row0 col14=7, row1 col14/15=7,7 expected but generated 0,1,1); also row8 col14=1 expected but generated 1 (wait, minor); row9 col14=7 expected but 1; row14 col5=7 expected but 1, and row14 has no 7s at cols5-8 where expected full bridge—handler likely failed all-one condition or propagation.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly leaves a stray 1 at row3 col6 (should be removed as isolated, but remove_isolated missed it? Wait, it has neighbors? No, expected all 0 there); marks some 7s correctly (e.g., row5 col9-11), but over-marks or misses in row12 (7s at cols6-8 match, but row6 col11=7 generated vs expected 1? Minor diff); overall, vertical handler works for main structure but misses cleaning upper isolated 1.
 * Handlers for horizontal size1/size2 catch basic gaps but loop in size2 (j+=1) may skip overlapping gaps; vertical handler is overly complex with openness checks that fail edge cases (e.g., when both sides closed but should propagate minimally).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and mostly works but applied only once—may need re-application after bridging.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., connected components) attempted, which could help identify larger blobs with internal gaps; current pattern-matching is brittle for irregular shapes.
 * Function handle_vertical_size1 is broken/incomplete: logic for open_left/open_right has redundancy (e.g., else clause propagates regardless) and misses cases like train1 row16 where a horizontal gap below needs vertical tie-in; not fully helpful yet.
 * handle_horizontal_size2 has condition for all_one_below and has_zero_above, which worked in train2 row12 but failed train1 row12 (didn't create the full bridge).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense as it marks 7s in patterns resembling bridges (e.g., row4 cols4-6/11-13 as 7s for horizontal gaps, row7 col2-4 for vertical), and cleans some 0-regions, but looks incorrect overall due to inconsistencies like row8 col4=0 (likely a gap not bridged, but expected might fill based on train patterns) and over-marking in row10 (7s at col10-12/13? but test input has sparse 1s there—may be propagating too far).
 * Missing potential vertical bridges in left columns (e.g., rows3-13 col4 has 1s with 0s, generated some 7s but not continuous like train1 row12 expected full row); row12 has 7s at cols5-7 but then 0s, suggesting handler stopped prematurely—does not look correct as it leaves apparent gaps unbridged.
 * Extra 7s in row5 col13=7 where input is 1 but may not need marking (over-propagation?); top rows all 1s unchanged except edges, but test input has 0s in cols5+ which stay 0—plausible but likely misses horizontal size2 in row3-5 cols10-13.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates partial gap handling but fails to create cohesive structures (e.g., no full vertical bridges on right like train2), so it does not look correct—needs better propagation and iteration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)
```
This is helpful for consistent neighbor counting across steps.

```python
def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```
This is essential for isolating objects and could be used to process each blob independently, avoiding global errors.

                if not touches_border and len(hole) <= 2:
                    holes.append(hole)
    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing where isolated 1s are removed, background (connected to borders) is identified via flood fill, and then boundaries around enclosed "holes" (internal 0-regions surrounded by 1s) are marked by changing adjacent 1s to 7s, without altering background 0s or internal hole 0s. The goal is to highlight the edges of objects or shapes defined by 1s, treating enclosed 0s as holes and ignoring border-connected 0s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * First, remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal 1-neighbors) to clean up noise before identifying structures.
 * Use flood fill from border 0s to distinguish background 0s (connected to edges) from internal holes (enclosed 0s not reachable from borders); this is crucial to avoid marking background as part of holes.
 * For potential hole 0s, check orthogonal 1-neighbors with a threshold: 2 for border cells (to handle edge cases), 3 for internal cells (to ensure true enclosure); only proceed if threshold met.
 * Marking happens only on neighboring 1s (changed to 7s) for confirmed hole-adjacent 0s; do not mark 0s at all, even internal ones—7s are strictly for boundary 1s.
 * Use 8 directions for marking neighbors to capture diagonal boundaries, but count neighbors orthogonally (4 directions) for enclosure checks to avoid overcounting.
 * Subtlety: After removal and flood fill, use a fixed copy of the grid for counting neighbors to avoid modifying counts mid-process; process all 0s in original order.
 * Easy to miss: Do not mark background 0s or their neighbors as 7s, even if they have many 1-neighbors—this prevents "leaking" into exterior areas.
 * Another subtlety: Isolated 1s must be removed before flood fill, as they could block background propagation if not handled.
 * Border 0s should never trigger marking unless part of a shallow enclosure, but threshold helps filter.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects; process all independently.
 * No changes to 0s inside holes—they remain 0; only boundaries get 7s.
 * Potential issue: Stray 1s in output (e.g., not removed or incorrectly preserved) indicate removal step failure.
 * Consider grid size variations (e.g., 16x16, 17x17); ensure bounds checking in all loops.

    background = set()

        for j in range(cols):
            if is_on_border(i, j, rows, cols) and grid[i][j] == 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                q.append((i, j))
                visited[i][j] = True
                background.add((i, j))
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions_4:
            nx, ny = x + di, y + dj
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                background.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return background
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this code) correctly removes isolated 1s in most cases but fails to remove some (e.g., stray 1 in training 1 row 14, column 8, which should be 0 in expected).
 * Flood fill for background works well, as most background 0s are untouched, but the marking step incorrectly sets neighboring background 0s to 7 when processing border-adjacent 0s with high 1-neighbor counts, leading to pollution (though not heavily visible in outputs).
 * Neighbor counting uses fixed_grid correctly, but marking loops over 8 directions and applies 7s to 1s properly for holes; however, the conditional "elif output[ni][nj] == 0 and is_bg" wrongly marks background 0-neighbors as 7, which may cause minor diffs.
 * Threshold (2 on border, 3 inside) is a good intuition for enclosure but over-marks in some shallow areas, e.g., in training 2 row 8, column 13 is 1 in generated but should be 1 (no change needed? wait, diff is in other spots like row 5 column 12: generated 1, expected 0? unclear, but mismatches exist).
 * In training 1, row 12 column 7 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected—likely a boundary 1 not marked because the adjacent 0 was misclassified as background or threshold not met.
 * In training 3, row 3 column 6 is 1 in generated but 0 in expected—indicates failure to remove an isolated 1 after step 1.
 * Processing order (all 0s after fixed_grid) is helpful but doesn't iterate to propagate marks; single pass misses chained boundaries.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., connected components for 1s) was attempted, which could help verify enclosures but isn't essential; the current approach is direct but buggy in marking conditions.
 * deepcopy is used well to avoid mutation issues.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The marking for background 0-neighbors (setting 0 to 7 if is_bg) is incorrect and should be removed entirely—it's not relevant and causes potential over-marking; don't use in future.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has extensive 7-marking on what appear to be boundaries around a large central structure, which looks plausible for enclosing holes (e.g., 7s outlining a blob in rows 3-12), but includes 7s on what might be background-adjacent 1s (e.g., top-left 1s unchanged, but some 0-regions in rows 2-3 have 7s that could be overreach).
 * It does not look fully correct: stray 0s inside potential holes (e.g., row 5 column 5=0, surrounded by 7s/1s) remain 0 as expected, but some boundary 1s like row 11 column 5=7 seem correct, yet the code's background-marking bug likely adds erroneous 7s in exterior areas (e.g., row 7 column 4=0 should stay 0, but if processed as bg, neighbors might be hit—output shows 7s nearby).
 * Missing: No isolated 1 removal visible, but test input has clean 1-structures; however, the output has unbroken 1-chains where 7s should split boundaries (e.g., row 4 columns 10-12=7,0,7 looks like hole marking, but compare mentally: input has 0s in top-right, likely background, so no 7s there—generated has them, indicating over-marking).
 * To handle test: Ensure marking only triggers for non-background 0s, and use stricter enclosure (e.g., confirm full surround); generated has too many 7s in potentially open areas (rows 0-1 all 1s/0s, but row 2 has 7s that might belong to internal hole only).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving binary image processing, where the goal is to preprocess a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/shape pixels) by removing noise like thin protrusions, identifying true background vs. internal holes, marking boundaries or edges of shapes with 7s (likely to highlight contours or fill shallow features), handling specific hole types (shallow internal ones to fill/mark, deeper ones to leave), and distinguishing external dents from internal features without over-marking or misclassifying regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules: Start by cleaning the grid (e.g., remove isolated or thinly connected 1s with <2 neighbors to eliminate noise/protrusions). Identify background as all 0s connected to the grid borders via flood fill (BFS/DFS from border 0s), treating internal enclosed 0s as holes. Mark 1s adjacent (8-directional) to internal (non-background) 0s as boundaries with 7 to highlight shape edges or holes. Fill or mark "shallow" holes—defined as internal 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) but with an "open" direction leading to background or edge—by setting the hole to 7, thinning adjacent walls to 0 if needed, and propagating marks to nearby regions (e.g., perpendicular sides or outer patches). For external dents (background 0s with >=2 adjacent 1s or exactly 3 neighbors), mark adjacent 1s as 7 without filling the dent itself, and extend marks horizontally/vertically if the dent opens to background.
 * Subtleties: Background flood fill must avoid marking internal holes as background; use visited array and only seed from border 0s. Shallow holes require checking "opposing" directions (e.g., if a wall 1 leads outward to background, fill the hole and mark/thin accordingly), but avoid over-filling deeper holes (e.g., those not directly open). External dents should not propagate marks into internal areas; use 4-directional for neighbor counts but 8 for adjacency checks. Thin protrusions are only removed if they have <2 1-neighbors (isolated or diagonal-only connections don't count as connected). Order matters: clean protrusions first, then background ID, then hole handling, then boundary marking, then dents—misordering can cascade errors (e.g., marking before cleaning leaves noise). 7s seem to represent "marked/filled boundary" but should not overwrite 1s unless thinning; avoid setting background 0s to 7 except in specific fills. Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; process all uniformly. Edge cases: fully enclosed shapes, 1-pixel holes/protrusions, diagonal connections (use 4-dir for connectivity, 8 for adjacency), and border-touching holes (treat as external/not shallow).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction needed (grids are small, process in-place); focus on topological features like connectivity and depth. Iterations may be needed for multi-layer holes, but single pass seems sufficient. Directions: 4-dir for orthogonal connectivity (e.g., neighbor counts for thinness/holes), 8-dir for boundary adjacency to catch diagonals. Outputs must preserve original 1/0 structure except for targeted 7 marks/fills—over-marking turns valid shapes into boundaries. Unknowns: Exact depth threshold for "shallow" (code assumes 1-layer, but may need recursion); why some expected 0s stay 0 while adjacent 1s get 7 (e.g., deep holes untouched).

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `handle_shallow_holes`: Overly complex and buggy—tries to fill 0s with 4 1-neighbors by checking "open" directions and propagating marks, but misfires (e.g., sets wrong outer patches to 7, thins incorrectly, marks perpendicular sides prematurely). Fills background-adjacent areas and creates artifacts; not handling depth properly leads to over-filling.
- `handle_external_dents`: Marks background 0s with >=2 or ==3 1-neighbors by setting adjacent 1s to 7 and extending horizontally/vertically, but propagates into internal regions and doesn't distinguish dent "openness" well (e.g., marks valid external 1s as boundaries). Condition for num_adj==3 assumes single open dir but fails on corners/diagonals; broken for multi-dent shapes.
- `is_on_border`: Unused in main program; simplistic (only checks edges) and not needed since background flood fill handles borders implicitly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in hole/dent handling despite good background ID and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated over-marks top-left 7s (e.g., row 0 cols 2-4 as 7,7,7 vs. expected 7,0,7; row 2 col 16 as 7 vs. 0) and adds extra 7s in bottom shapes (e.g., row 17 col 14 as 0,7,1 vs. expected 7,0,7,1—flipped hole mark); also fills row 5 entirely with 7s where expected has sparse 7s and 0s. What worked: Correctly identified some internal boundaries (e.g., row 1 cols 14-16 as 7,7). What didn't: Shallow hole logic filled external dents as internal and propagated wrongly (unknown why row 5 over-filled, possibly background mis-ID).
 * Train 2: Generated marks entire top/middle as 7s (e.g., row 2 all 7s vs. expected all 1s; row 3 cols 1-13 as 7,0s vs. expected 1,0s) and adds spurious 7s in bottom hole (e.g., row 7 col 9 as 0 vs. expected 0, but surrounds wrong). What worked: Some external dent marking (e.g., row 15 all 1s correct). What didn't: Boundary marking over-applied to non-hole areas; thin protrusion removal missed large 0-regions, treating them as shallow holes (unknown cascade from order).
 * Train 3: Generated adds outer 7-frame around shape (e.g., row 3 cols 3-15 as 7s vs. expected 0s; row 4 col 3 as 7 vs. 0) and over-marks internals (e.g., row 6 col 11 as 0 vs. expected 0, but adjacent 7s wrong). What worked: Some internal hole boundaries marked (e.g., row 6 cols 9-11 as 7,0,7 matching expected). What didn't: Dent handling marked border-adjacent 1s as 7 prematurely; protrusion removal insufficient, leaving stubs that triggered false boundaries.
 * Overall: Background flood fill works (correct in isolated tests, avoids internals). Neighbor counting solid. But handling functions broken—shallow fills propagate to background, dents mark too broadly, no iteration for multi-step cleans. No object extraction attempted (not needed, as global processing suffices). Program order exposes cleaned grid to flawed handlers, causing 7-overload.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s in ways inconsistent with training expectations, such as filling large internal regions (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 6-12 as all 7s, likely a mis-filled "hole" that's actually shape body) and adding spurious 0s/7s in bottom (e.g., row 11 cols 11-13 as 7,7,7 vs. probable need for sparser boundaries). External edges have inconsistent thinning (e.g., row 0 col 5 as 7,0s vs. expected clean 1s or marked only at dents). It resembles training failures: background ID probably correct, but shallow/dent logic cascades to mark valid 1s as 7 and leave deep holes unmarked. To fix for test: Refine shallow check to require explicit "outer open" to background (not just edge), limit propagation to 1-step, and apply dent marking only after all internals—test has complex nested shapes (e.g., central 1s with 0-dents), so need better depth (e.g., distance from background >1 for internal).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a binary grid (0s for empty/background, 1s for filled pixels, likely representing shapes or blobs in a larger image) to simulate some kind of boundary detection, gap-filling, or shape refinement rule. The goal is to output a modified grid where isolated 1s are removed (set to 0), small gaps (size 1 or 2, horizontal or vertical) in connected 1-regions are "bridged" by marking the flanking 1s (and sometimes the gap itself) with 7s to indicate boundaries or connections, and these 7 markings propagate to adjacent rows/columns only if those segments are uniform (all 1s or all 0s), with multiple passes to handle interactions between horizontal and vertical directions; the result highlights structure while preserving the overall shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-connected 1-neighbors) as single-pixel "Blues" or noise disappear; this happens first and is straightforward.
 * Gap-bridging: For horizontal/vertical gaps of size 1 or 2 between 1s, mark the flanking 1s with 7 (to denote boundaries or connections), but do not fill the gap with 1s—keep it as 0s; this is not true filling but marking edges for visual emphasis.
 * Edge cases: Handle gaps at grid edges (left/right for horizontal, top/bottom for vertical) separately, as they lack one side; e.g., a size-1 gap at left edge (0 followed by 1) marks the adjacent 1 as 7.
 * Propagation subtlety: After marking 7s for a gap, propagate to adjacent rows (for horizontal gaps) or columns (for vertical gaps) only over the exact segment length (e.g., 3 cells for size-1 gap, 4 for size-2), and only if that segment is uniform (all 1s or all 0s in the original values); this prevents over-marking mixed areas and simulates "uniform extension" of boundaries.
 * Multiple passes: Apply horizontal gap handling, then vertical, then repeat (at least once) to catch interactions, like a horizontal gap creating a vertical one or vice versa; without passes, some markings miss.
 * Directions: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for neighbor counting, but gap detection is strictly linear (row-wise for horizontal, column-wise for vertical).
 * No diagonal handling: Gaps and propagation are axis-aligned only; no 8-connected or diagonal propagation, which could explain some missed connections.
 * Uniformity check: For propagation, use "all(v == 1) or all(v == 0)" or equivalent (len(set(vals)) == 1); this is key to avoid marking non-uniform areas, but it's easy to miss that 7s already present might break uniformity if not handled carefully.
 * Grid size variations: Grids are rectangular but not always square; handle empty or small grids gracefully; examples vary from 16x16 to 16x17-ish.
 * Subtle over-marking risk: Propagation can chain incorrectly if not using copies or if passes over-apply; e.g., a marked 7 in an adjacent row might then trigger further gaps.
 * No object extraction needed: While connected components might help identify blobs, the rules seem local (per row/column), not global; attempting full object extraction (e.g., flood-fill) could be overkill or unhelpful here.
 * 7 as marker only: 7s do not count as 1s for neighbor counting or uniformity (treat as distinct); final output keeps 0s, 1s, and 7s without converting back.
 * Isolated after marking: Removals happen only at start; later 1s aren't re-checked for isolation, even if markings isolate them.
 * Potential missed rules: Some examples suggest vertical gaps might propagate differently (e.g., in train 2, expected has 1s where generated has 7s, possibly no marking in certain blob interiors); horizontal size-2 might not always propagate fully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
```
(This defines 4-connected directions, useful for neighbor counting; essential for isolation check.)

```python
def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions. Handles observation of isolated cells."""
    count = 0
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] in target_values:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is helpful and correct for checking 1-neighbors; used in isolation removal; could extend to other counts if needed.)

```python
def remove_isolated(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove 1s with zero 4-connected 1-neighbors (isolated pixels). Based on observation that single-pixel Blues disappear."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if new_grid[i][j] == 1 and count_neighbors(new_grid, i, j, rows, cols, directions_4, (1,)) == 0:
                new_grid[i][j] = 0
    return new_grid
```
(This works well; correctly removes isolates without side effects; apply first in main program.)

(The gap-handling functions like handle_horizontal_size1_gaps, handle_vertical_gaps, etc., are partially helpful as they detect gaps correctly but over-propagate 7s due to uniformity checks or pass ordering; the composition in handle_horizontal_gaps and multiple passes in program() are good ideas but buggy in execution. Edge handlers like handle_horizontal_edge_gaps are useful for boundaries but need tighter uniformity checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly removes isolated 1s in all examples (no differences noted in isolates).
 * Gap detection works for many size-1 and size-2 cases, e.g., in train 1 rows 0-5 and 9-13, most 7s match expected positions.
 * Multiple passes (horiz then vert then repeat) capture some interactions, like propagating across directions.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly matches but differs in row 11 (pos 5: 7 vs expected 0, over-marked during vertical propagation?); row 14 (pos 8: 7 vs all 0s, spurious propagation from above); row 17 (pos 8: 7 vs 1, and pos 13: 7 vs 1? Wait, expected has 7 at 13 but generated has it early—mismatch in horizontal gap detection); reason unknown but likely over-propagation in vertical_size1_gaps.
 * Train 2: Major mismatches, e.g., row 2: generated has 7s at pos 1-2 vs expected 1s (failed to skip interior uniform 1s?); row 5: generated 7s at pos 6-12 vs expected 1s (over-marked a non-gap area as gap); row 6: generated 1 at pos 6 vs expected 1, but 7s propagate wrongly; row 8: pos 13: 7 vs expected 1 (extra marking); suggests propagation condition too loose, marking uniform 1-blocks incorrectly.
 * Train 3: Minor mismatches, e.g., row 3: generated has 1 at pos 6 vs expected 0 (failed to remove a near-isolate?); row 6: pos 12: 7 vs expected 7, but pos 11: 0 vs 7? Wait, generated [...,7,0,7,...] expected [...,0,7,7,...]—shifted 7 placement; row 7: pos 12: 0 vs 7; likely edge in vertical gap handling misaligns.
 * Function `handle_horizontal_size2_gaps` and similar are helpful for detection but broken in propagation (applies to non-gaps or over-uniform checks); don't use without fixing uniformity to strictly original values before marking.
 * No object extraction function present, but not needed—local row/column scans suffice; adding flood-fill would be unhelpful and complicate.
 * Overall, isolation and basic gap marking work (partial understanding), but propagation over-marks interiors and misses exact uniformity, causing all trains to fail.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-marks with 7s in ways that don't align with expected patterns from trainings (e.g., row 2 has 7s at pos 10-12, but if this is a gap, propagation to row 3 seems excessive with 7 at pos 11; row 8 has 7s spreading horizontally where a vertical gap might not warrant it).
 * It misses potential vertical gap bridging in cols 5-7 (e.g., row 0-1 are 0s, but row 2 has 0s—should mark flanking if size-2, but instead marks unrelated areas like row 9 pos 11).
 * Extra 7s in row 10 (pos 5-7) look like over-propagation from a horizontal gap, similar to train failures; the output fragments the main blob with unnecessary 7s (e.g., row 4 pos 4-6: 7s where expected might keep 1s for uniformity).
 * To handle test, need stricter propagation (only if adjacent segment exactly matches the gap's flanking pattern, not just uniform) and more passes or reverse-order application to avoid chaining errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing binary grids (0s and 1s representing empty space and filled shapes/objects) to clean up irregular features like thin protrusions, identify and mark small gaps or runs of 0s (possibly "cracks" or "holes" in shapes), and highlight adjacent areas using 7s, likely to emphasize boundaries, small defects, or connectable gaps without altering the core structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents shapes or "blobs" of 1s surrounded by 0s; the goal is to preserve main shapes while removing or marking minor irregularities like thin lines (protrusions with <2 neighbors) and small 0-runs (<=2 consecutive 0s in rows, possibly indicating narrow gaps).
 * 7s are used to "mark" or highlight specific 1s adjacent (using 8 directions) to small 0-runs, but only if they touch the run; overmarking internal 1s as 7s (e.g., solid blocks) is incorrect, as seen in examples where expected output keeps core 1s unchanged.
 * Single 0-gaps between 1s in rows should trigger marking of nearby 0s above/below (if they form a small empty area of 3 consecutive 0s), but only if flanked by 1s; this seems aimed at filling or noting bridgeable gaps, but must not propagate to larger empty areas or alter non-gap 1s.
 * Cleaning must be iterative and only remove isolated/thin 1s (<2 orthogonal neighbors), but stop before eroding main shapes; subtle: use 4 directions for cleaning to avoid diagonal erosion, but 8 for marking to catch diagonal adjacencies.
 * Grids have borders of 0s or 1s in some cases (e.g., full rows of 1s or 0s); do not mark border 1s unless they directly border small internal 0-runs.
 * Subtle elements: Small 0-runs are row-specific (horizontal only in current code), but may need vertical/hole detection; avoid marking in large empty areas (runs >2); 7s should not replace 0s in core empty spaces or create new 1s—only overlay on existing 1s or specific 0s.
 * Order matters: Clean protrusions first, then fill/mark gaps on the cleaned grid; running marking before cleaning can propagate errors.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-cell gaps vs. protrusions; diagonal connections shouldn't trigger cleaning but may for marking; no global connectivity (e.g., flood fill) yet, but may be needed to distinguish separate objects.
 * Across attempts: No object extraction yet, but shapes seem like letters/symbols (e.g., ex2 looks like a figure with arms/legs); 7s highlight "defects" like small holes or thin parts without removing them.

                    n = count_neighbors(current, i, j, rows, cols, directions_4, (1,))
                    if n < 2:
                        new_grid[i][j] = 0
                        changed = True
        current = new_grid
    return current
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly handles training example 1, preserving a clean shape with appropriate 7s on small edge gaps.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated overmarks some 1s as 7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs expected1; row5 col13:7 vs1; row6 col12:0 but marks surrounding as7 incorrectly; row8 col13:7 vs0? Wait, expected has1 there but generated7; row9 col13:1 vs0—mismatch); under-marks others (e.g., row6 col12 should be1 but generated0, missing7 nearby); fill_single_gaps marks too aggressively in vertical gaps, turning solid1s into7s; mark_small_zero_runs catches horizontal runs<=2 but misses vertical/diagonal contexts, leading to extra7s in row7-9 cols7-10.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated over-erodes or over-marks core1s as7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs1; row5 col9-11:7,7,7 vs1,1,1; row6 col11:7 vs7? but row6 col12:7 vs0 mismatch; row7 col11:0 vs0 ok but surrounding7s extra; row8 col10:1 vs1 ok but row8 col11-12:7,7 vs7,7 ok—partial; row12 col6-8:7,7,7 vs7,7,7 ok); cleaning removes too little (shape intact but marking turns internal "thick" parts to7s); fill_single_gaps incorrectly fills non-single gaps or propagates to borders.
 * clean_thin_protrusions is helpful and correct for ex1 (removes isolates without harming main blob), but may not handle "thin but connected" arms in ex2/ex3 (e.g., doesn't remove enough in vertical thin parts).
 * mark_small_zero_runs is partially helpful for horizontal small gaps but broken for overmarking (uses8-dir on any adjacent1, hitting internals; should check if1 is "edge" or limit to run ends); doesn't handle vertical runs.
 * fill_single_gaps is unhelpful/broken: Only checks horizontal single0s flanked by1s, then marks3-wide0s above/below if all0—but in ex2/ex3, this creates extra7s in larger empty areas (e.g., ex3 row5-6 gaps marked wrongly); doesn't fill the gap itself (sets output on0s to7, but expected keeps some0s); ignores vertical singles; not relevant if puzzle is about marking borders, not filling.
 * No object extraction function yet, but needed for future: Separate blobs to process independently (e.g., via flood fill) to avoid cross-marking; current code treats whole grid as one, causing issues in multi-object grids like ex3 (multiple shapes?).
 * Overall: Core cleaning works (ex1 pass), but marking logic misses subtlety of "small defects only" (overmarks thick/internal1s); no vertical gap detection; order of fill/mark causes propagation errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it overmarks internal and thick parts of the main shape with7s (e.g., row3 cols10-12:7,7,7 seem like marking a small horizontal0-run above, but expected likely keeps core1s as1s per ex2/ex3 patterns; row4 col11:0 isolated but surrounded by7s—may be underfilled; row5 cols4-6:7,7,7 on what looks like a thick arm, turning it to marked when expected probably keeps as1 like ex3's main body; row7 col3:7 on edge ok, but row8 col4:0 vs expected? possibly a gap but overpropagates to row8 cols11-13:7,7,7 internal); large empty right side (cols14-15 all0) unmarked ok, but left border1s (cols0-4) mostly preserved except scattered7s (e.g., row11 col5:7 ok for gap, but row12 col8:7? may be extra). It makes partial sense for marking small gaps/protrusions (e.g., row2-3 small7 cluster near center), but fails on subtlety of not marking solid cores—similar to ex3 overmarking—suggesting needs better gap size limits and vertical checks; without expected, it visually disrupts the shape more than highlights defects.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns that hold across all cases, such as color affecting structure, position influencing color or splitting, hole count linking to pixel redistribution, and spatial overlaps driving changes. No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving attempts are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background regions without direct ties to other components) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear links (e.g., exact mirroring direction, precise hole reduction amounts) are noted as unknown rather than forced.

#### 1. **Color Shift Interaction: Blue to Dark Red Based on Spatial Overlap with Input Structures**
   - **Description**: Parts of input Blue components consistently transform to Dark Red in output where there is direct spatial overlap between the input Blue bounding box (bbox) and new Dark Red bbox. The remaining non-overlapping Blue parts retain Blue color but with reduced pixels.
   - **Properties Involved**: Color (Blue → Dark Red), position (bbox overlap), pixel count (transfer from Blue to Dark Red).
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input Blue [0,9,16,14] overlaps output Dark Red [4,9,7,12] and [7,3,9,5] (partial y-overlap with adjacent input [0,0,16,4]); Blue pixels drop from 83 to 70, with Dark Red gaining 12 + 8.
     - Train 2: Input Blue [6,5,11,9] overlaps output Dark Red [7,6,9,8] and [13,5,15,9] (adjacent extension); Blue pixels drop from 29 to 21, Dark Red gains 8 + 11.
     - Train 3: Input Blue [4,3,13,12] overlaps output Dark Red [9,5,12,8] and [6,11,8,13]; Blue pixels drop from 88 to 70, Dark Red gains 12 + 8.
   - **Effect**: Overlapping regions cause color change and pixel redistribution; non-overlapping Blue regions stay intact but lose pixels to the shift.
   - **Unknown**: Exact trigger for which subregions overlap (e.g., no consistent edge/corner rule identifiable).

#### 2. **Hole Count Interaction: Input Holes Affect Output Dark Red Hole Creation and Blue Hole Reduction**
   - **Description**: Input Blue components with holes (>0) consistently result in output Dark Red components gaining holes=1, while the corresponding output Blue part has reduced (or equal) hole count. Components with 0 input holes do not spawn holed Dark Red.
   - **Properties Involved**: Hole count (input → output redistribution), color (tied to hole presence for Dark Red emergence).
   - **Consistency Across Examples** (only for holed input components):
     - Train 1: Input Blue holes=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → output Blue holes=0 (reduced) + Dark Red holes=1 ([4,9,7,12]).
     - Train 2: Input Blue holes=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → output Blue holes=1 (equal) + Dark Red holes=1 ([13,5,15,9] and [7,6,9,8]); input holes=3 ([0,0,15,15]) → output Blue holes=1 (reduced) + Dark Red holes=1 ([5,12,8,14]).
     - Train 3: Input Blue holes=2 ([4,3,13,12]) → output Blue holes=1 (reduced) + Dark Red holes=1 ([6,11,8,13]); another Dark Red holes=2 (possibly aggregated from input holes).
   - **Effect**: Holes in input Blue "transfer" to create holed Dark Red components, reducing burden on remaining Blue (consistent reduction or stabilization of holes in Blue).
   - **Unknown**: How multiple input holes aggregate (e.g., why Train 3 has one Dark Red with holes=2); not all reductions are by exactly 1.

#### 3. **Position Interaction: Small 1x1 Input Pixels Affect Nearby Output Dark Red Positioning and Size**
   - **Description**: Input 1x1 Blue pixels (holes=0, pixels=1) consistently interact with adjacent or extended positions in output, causing small Dark Red components to form nearby or at shifted positions (often rightward or edge-adjacent), with the input pixel itself disappearing (no 1x1 Blue remains).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (input pixel location → output Dark Red bbox shift), size (1 pixel → small multi-pixel Dark Red), color (Blue pixel → Dark Red structure).
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input 1x1 at [13,7] (near-right) → output small Dark Red [15,1,16,3] (right-shifted, pixels=5) and [13,16,15,18] (y-shifted, pixels=8); input [3,15] (left-bottom) → partial tie to [2,0,4,1] (left-top shift, pixels=5).
     - Train 2: Input 1x1 at [4,8] (left-middle) → output small Dark Red [14,0,15,1] (right-top shift, pixels=3); also influences adjacent [13,5,15,9] extension (rightward from input position).
     - Train 3: Input 1x1 at [15,4] (right) and [1,14] (left-bottom) → output Dark Red [9,5,12,8] (central from right input) and [6,11,8,13] (central from left input), both small-ish (pixels=12 and 8).
   - **Effect**: Input 1x1 position "seeds" a Dark Red component at a transformed position (consistent shift pattern toward edges/centers), absorbing the pixel into a larger structure.
   - **Unknown**: Exact transformation rule for position shift (e.g., consistent horizontal/vertical mirroring not identifiable; varies slightly per example).

#### 4. **Pixel Count Interaction: Overall Pixel Conservation with Color-Based Redistribution**
   - **Description**: Total pixels from all input Blue components are consistently redistributed to output Blue + Dark Red components, with no net loss/gain beyond minor variances (~1-3 pixels, possibly due to connection thresholds). Dark Red always gains pixels from Blue reductions.
   - **Properties Involved**: Pixel count (input total → output split by color), color (Blue retains majority, Dark Red takes subsets).
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train 1: Input total ~200 → output total ~203 (Blue: 67+70+26+2=165; Dark Red: 5+5+8+12+8=38).
     - Train 2: Input total ~194 → output total ~189 (Blue: 21+139=160; Dark Red: 3+11+8+10=32). Slight variance, but redistribution holds.
     - Train 3: Input total ~90 → output total ~90 (Blue: 70; Dark Red: 12+8=20).
   - **Effect**: Pixels "move" from Blue to Dark Red via the above spatial/hole interactions, preserving mass but altering color distribution.
   - **Unknown**: Source of minor pixel variances (e.g., not tied to a specific property like edges).

No other interactions (e.g., silhouette/edge effects on movement, specific shape transformations like L-shapes to colors) were consistently identifiable across all examples without forcing unrelated ties. Test inputs were not analyzed for interactions, as they lack outputs for comparison.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 20:48:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a binary grid processing puzzle focused on cleaning and annotating pixel art or shape representations, where isolated 1s (foreground pixels) are removed, boundaries around fully enclosed 0-holes (internal voids) are marked with 7s, and small background dents or protrusions are filled/marked to smooth shapes, while preserving the overall structure of connected 1-components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s iteratively if they have zero orthogonal (4-dir) 1-neighbors, but only after or before other steps to avoid over-removal in connected groups.
 * Distinguish background 0s (connected to border via 4-connectivity flood fill) from enclosed holes (internal 0s not reachable from border); enclosed holes are identified if they have >=3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (or >=2 if on border, though border holes may be treated as background).
 * For enclosed holes, mark all 8-dir adjacent 1s as 7 to highlight boundaries, but do not fill the hole itself (keep as 0).
 * For background 0s that are "dents" (high 1-neighbors: >=3 internal, >=2 on border), mark adjacent 1s as 7 and potentially fill adjacent low-neighbor background 0s (0 1-neighbors) with 7 to smooth jagged edges, but avoid over-filling large background areas.
 * Process steps in order: clean isolated first, then mark hole boundaries, then handle dents; use copies to avoid modifying during iteration.
 * Subtle: On-border 0s with fewer neighbors might still be dents if they protrude into shapes; avoid marking background-adjacent 1s unless specifically tied to dents/holes; 8-dir for boundary marking but 4-dir for connectivity/neighbor counts to match standard blob analysis.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; preserve all unless isolated; no rotation/scaling, just in-place modification.
 * Edge cases: Single-pixel holes, diagonal-only connections (not counted as enclosed if 4-connectivity), large empty grids, or shapes touching borders (their "holes" may be background).

(Note: These are from the attempt and seem core/helpful for neighbor counting, background detection, and isolation removal; minor tweaks like avoiding duplicate seeds in flood fill could help.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `mark_boundaries_around_enclosed_holes`: Broken – incorrectly marks 1s adjacent to enclosed 0s but uses flawed criteria (e.g., marks on-border holes as enclosed, leading to extra 7s); does not properly exclude background-adjacent cases and over-marks in example 1 row 5 (generated has isolated 7s, expected has clustered 7s) and example 3 row 3 (generated keeps stray 1, expected removes it entirely?).
 * `fill_and_mark_small_dents`: Partially broken – over-fills or mis-marks background dents, e.g., in example 1 row 14 (generated places erroneous 1 in background, expected all 0s) and row 16 (generated has single 7, expected three 7s); condition for filling low-neighbor 0s (neigh1==0) is too narrow and doesn't propagate fills properly; in example 2, it fails to mark a key 1 as 7 in row 8 col 13 (generated 1, expected 7? Wait, expected has 1 there, but other mismatches suggest dent handling is off).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes steps in logical order (isolate removal -> hole marking -> dent filling) but fails all training examples due to bugs in hole/dent detection.
 * Worked: Isolated 1 removal seems functional (e.g., example 3 row 3 generated removes most but misses context); background flood fill identifies large 0-regions correctly in examples 1 and 2.
 * Did not work: Hole marking over-applies to border-adjacent 0s (example 1 row 5: generated [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,...], missing cluster of 7s); dent filling adds erroneous 1s or misplaced 7s (example 1 row 14: generated has 1 at col 8, expected 0; row 12: generated 7 at end, expected in middle at col 7).
 * Example 2 mismatches in row 8 col 13 (generated 1, expected 1? But overall incorrect, possibly due to under-marking dent boundaries) and row 9 col 13 (generated 1, expected 1, but dent in rows 13-15 not fully marked with 7s in right positions).
 * Example 3: Fails to remove a stray 1 in row 3 col 6 (generated keeps it, expected all 0s there); dent in row 13 (generated no 7s, expected 7s at cols 6-8); suggests isolation removal doesn't propagate or hole marking misses small internal 0s.
 * No object extraction function present, but one could be added to identify connected 1-components for per-shape processing; current global approach misses shape-specific rules.
 * Flood fill seeds duplicates on corners, potentially inefficient but not breaking; neighbor counts are accurate but thresholds (e.g., >=3 for holes) too rigid for border cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct – it marks excessive 7s in what appears to be a single large shape with possible internal hole or dent (rows 4-11 show clustered 7s around 0s, but over-marks borders like row 2 col 11=7 where it might be background protrusion).
 * Missing proper dent filling: Row 12 has 0s and isolated 7s ([1,1,1,1,1,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]), suggesting incomplete smoothing of jagged background edges; expected likely fills row 12 cols 6-8 with 7s similar to example 1 row 16.
 * Extra markings: Rows 0-2 and 12-15 have 7s in positions that seem like boundary overreach (e.g., row 2 col 11=7 next to 0s, but if background, should not mark adjacent 1s unless dent); looks like hole marking treated border 0s as enclosed.
 * Overall, output has too many scattered 7s and unfilled dents (e.g., row 5 col 5=0 with surrounding 7s/1s suggests unresolved hole), unlike cleaner expected patterns in training where 7s cluster tightly around internals; does not match inferred rules as shape in cols 0-4 rows 0-15 seems solid but gets boundary noise.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:48:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (with 1s as foreground/structure and 0s as background) using morphological-like operations to clean shapes, mark boundaries or thin/vulnerable areas with 7, fill small internal gaps selectively, and preserve core structures while removing noise or protrusions. The goal is to produce a modified grid that highlights boundaries and fills without over-processing, matching specific expected patterns that seem to represent cleaned-up puzzle pieces or objects with marked edges/holes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include removing isolated or thin 1s (fewer than 2 adjacent 1s in 4-connectivity) by setting them to 0 or marking as 7 to avoid losing structure entirely.
 * Boundary detection: Mark 1s with fewer than 3 adjacent 1s (4-connectivity) as 7 to highlight edges, protrusions, or thin parts without removing them.
 * Gap filling: Convert 0s to 7 if they have at least 2 adjacent 1s or 7s (using 8-connectivity for broader neighborhood), but only for small/internal gaps; avoid filling large empty areas or external noise.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve overall shape integrity—do not over-fill or over-remove, as expected outputs retain specific 0s in holes or separations (e.g., train1 has isolated 0s inside structures that should stay 0, not filled to 7). 7s often mark boundaries around holes or edges, but not all edges (selective, e.g., internal vs. external). Connectivity matters: 4-connectivity for removal/boundary to avoid diagonal artifacts, 8-connectivity for filling to catch diagonal gaps. Order of operations is key (clean first, then boundary, then fill) to prevent feedback loops. Grids have empty rows/columns that must remain 0. Objects may be separate blobs; process independently without merging unrelated areas. Avoid aggressive filling that connects distant structures (e.g., train2 expected keeps wide 0 gaps as 0). 7s seem temporary markers for "processed" areas, but expected outputs mix 1s, 7s, and 0s precisely, suggesting 7 is for boundaries/holes, not full replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Directions for 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors)
directions_4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

# Directions for 8-connectivity (including diagonals)
directions_8 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

    return sum(1 for di, dj in directions 
               if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] in target_values)

def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of 1s using 4-connectivity; useful for processing objects separately."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for di, dj in directions_4:
                        ni, nj = x + di, y + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                            visited[ni][nj] = True
                            stack.append((ni, nj))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs  # List of lists of (i,j) positions for each blob
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a sequential pipeline: remove thin protrusions (<2 neighbors, set to 0), color boundaries (<3 neighbors, set to 7), then fill gaps (>=2 neighbors to 1/7 using 8-connectivity, set to 7); this worked partially for marking some boundaries (e.g., generated 7s on edges in train1 row 0) but over-applied 7s to internal areas that should remain 1.
 * What worked: Boundary coloring correctly identified some edge 1s (e.g., train1 generated 7s match expected in parts of rows 0-4), and gap filling caught small 0s near structures (e.g., train3 filled some internal 0s to 7 where expected has 7s around holes).
 * What didn't work: Removal set too many 1s to 0 prematurely, losing structure before boundary/fill steps (e.g., train1 generated full 0 rows 6-7 where expected has sparse 0s and 7s); over-filling turned large empty areas or non-gaps to 7 (e.g., train2 generated 7s in wide 0 columns 2-5 where expected keeps 0s); boundary marking was too aggressive, turning core 1s to 7 (e.g., train1 row 5 all 7s vs. expected sparse 7s and 0s).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated filled entire bottom sections with 7s (rows 15-18) and over-marked top structures (e.g., row 0 has extra 7s at start/end vs. expected 1s and specific 7/0 placements); unknown why row 5 became all 7s—possibly boundary rule applied after cleaning propagated incorrectly.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated kept some 0s in gaps (good, e.g., columns 3-4) but over-marked horizontal bars as 7s (row 3 all 7s vs. expected 0s); filled unrelated areas (e.g., row 7 has 7s where expected has 0s in gaps); protrusions not removed cleanly, leaving thin 1s as 7 instead of 0.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated over-extended 7s vertically (e.g., rows 3-13 have wide 7 bands vs. expected narrower 1/7 mix with specific 0 holes); failed to preserve isolated 0s inside structures (e.g., row 6 generated all 1/7 vs. expected 0s in hole positions).
 * Function `remove_thin_protrusions` is somewhat helpful but broken—sets to 0 too aggressively without considering blob context, leading to structure loss; modify to set to 7 instead for marking.
 * Function `color_boundary_areas` is helpful for edge detection but over-applies (<3 threshold too low, catches internal thin areas); raise to <2 or integrate with blob extraction.
 * Function `fill_small_gaps` is partially helpful (catches small 0s) but not selective enough (>=2 too low for 8-connectivity, fills external noise); add blob isolation or max gap size check.
 * No extraction of objects/blobs in attempt, which is a miss—processing whole grid causes cross-contamination between separate structures (e.g., train1 top/bottom objects merged via fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s (e.g., rows 2-3 have long 7 bands where a cleaner structure with fewer 7s is likely expected, similar to train1's over-filling), leaves unnecessary 0s in what seem like internal areas (e.g., row 0 columns 6-15 all 0 vs. potential small fills needed), and creates asymmetric boundaries (e.g., left side heavy on 7s in rows 6-14, but right side sparse, unlike balanced expected patterns in trainings). It fails to handle potential holes or separations properly (e.g., row 12 has 7s that might connect unrelated parts, where 0s should persist like in train2 gaps). Overall, it resembles the training errors: aggressive boundary/fill without preserving specific 0 holes or thin 1 cores, suggesting the pipeline needs blob-wise processing and stricter gap criteria to match subtle expected details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the grid to remove isolated 1s and mark (with 7s) specific gap-filling or bridging patterns in horizontal and vertical directions, likely to highlight connected regions or paths while preserving the overall structure. The output transforms the input grid by setting certain 1s to 7s to indicate bridges over gaps of size 1 or 2, with rules considering adjacency, openness on sides, and interactions between rows/columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-directional neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't contribute to connected structures.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a row), mark the flanking 1s as 7s and propagate 7s to adjacent 1s above/below within the gap span; avoid bridging if both above and below the gap are fully zero in that span.
 * For horizontal gaps of size 2 (two 0s between two 1s), similar marking but with more complex conditions: bridge if below is all zeros or (all ones and above has a zero); propagate to adjacent rows only under specific all-zero/all-one conditions.
 * For vertical gaps of size 1 (a single 0 between two 1s in a column), mark flanking 1s as 7s and check left/right openness (if both open, propagate to adjacent 1s; if one side open and all-zero/all-one, bridge that side; otherwise, propagate to 1s on sides).
 * Subtlety: Propagation doesn't always fill entire adjacent rows/columns—only to 1s or under all-zero conditions; avoid over-marking closed sides.
 * Order of operations matters: apply isolated removal first, then horizontal handlers, then vertical, as changes can affect later detections.
 * Gaps must be detected without overlapping or skipping due to loop increments (e.g., j +=1 in size2 handler risks missing adjacent gaps).
 * Edge cases: Gaps at grid borders (e.g., open if at edge), multi-row interactions (e.g., don't bridge if sandwiched between zeros), and larger structures where gaps interact (e.g., L-shapes or corners may require vertical after horizontal).
 * No diagonal considerations—only 4-directional neighbors.
 * 7s seem to "infect" or highlight bridges but don't change 0s to 1s; preserve original 0s unless part of a bridge condition.
 * Potential for iterative application? Current code is single-pass per handler, but some expected outputs suggest multiple interactions (e.g., new gaps created by prior markings).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) partially understands gap bridging but fails all training examples, correctly removing some isolations (e.g., in train1 row 14, isolated 1 becomes 0) but missing many 7 placements.
 * In train1: Generated marks some horizontal bridges (e.g., row0 cols2/4 as 7s matching expected) and vertical in row4 col8/10, but misses vertical bridges in row11 (expected 7s at col4-6, generated all 1s or 0s) and row12 (expected full 7 bridge row5 cols4-7, generated plain 1s); also row16 expected has 7s at cols13-15 but generated all 0s—unknown why vertical handler skipped it, possibly due to prior horizontal changes or openness checks failing; row1 col16/17 has extra 7s not in expected.
 * In train2: Generated correctly handles some vertical gaps (e.g., row7 col13-15 as 7,0,7 matching) and horizontal in row12 (7s at cols5-8), but misses top-right vertical bridge (row0 col14=7, row1 col14/15=7,7 expected but generated 0,1,1); also row8 col14=1 expected but generated 1 (wait, minor); row9 col14=7 expected but 1; row14 col5=7 expected but 1, and row14 has no 7s at cols5-8 where expected full bridge—handler likely failed all-one condition or propagation.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly leaves a stray 1 at row3 col6 (should be removed as isolated, but remove_isolated missed it? Wait, it has neighbors? No, expected all 0 there); marks some 7s correctly (e.g., row5 col9-11), but over-marks or misses in row12 (7s at cols6-8 match, but row6 col11=7 generated vs expected 1? Minor diff); overall, vertical handler works for main structure but misses cleaning upper isolated 1.
 * Handlers for horizontal size1/size2 catch basic gaps but loop in size2 (j+=1) may skip overlapping gaps; vertical handler is overly complex with openness checks that fail edge cases (e.g., when both sides closed but should propagate minimally).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and mostly works but applied only once—may need re-application after bridging.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., connected components) attempted, which could help identify larger blobs with internal gaps; current pattern-matching is brittle for irregular shapes.
 * Function handle_vertical_size1 is broken/incomplete: logic for open_left/open_right has redundancy (e.g., else clause propagates regardless) and misses cases like train1 row16 where a horizontal gap below needs vertical tie-in; not fully helpful yet.
 * handle_horizontal_size2 has condition for all_one_below and has_zero_above, which worked in train2 row12 but failed train1 row12 (didn't create the full bridge).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense as it marks 7s in patterns resembling bridges (e.g., row4 cols4-6/11-13 as 7s for horizontal gaps, row7 col2-4 for vertical), and cleans some 0-regions, but looks incorrect overall due to inconsistencies like row8 col4=0 (likely a gap not bridged, but expected might fill based on train patterns) and over-marking in row10 (7s at col10-12/13? but test input has sparse 1s there—may be propagating too far).
 * Missing potential vertical bridges in left columns (e.g., rows3-13 col4 has 1s with 0s, generated some 7s but not continuous like train1 row12 expected full row); row12 has 7s at cols5-7 but then 0s, suggesting handler stopped prematurely—does not look correct as it leaves apparent gaps unbridged.
 * Extra 7s in row5 col13=7 where input is 1 but may not need marking (over-propagation?); top rows all 1s unchanged except edges, but test input has 0s in cols5+ which stay 0—plausible but likely misses horizontal size2 in row3-5 cols10-13.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates partial gap handling but fails to create cohesive structures (e.g., no full vertical bridges on right like train2), so it does not look correct—needs better propagation and iteration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing to identify and mark the boundaries (edges) of connected "objects" made of 1s, converting boundary 1s to 7s while preserving internal 1s as 1s and background 0s as 0s. The goal appears to be outline detection for shapes, accounting for irregularities like holes, dents, and border interactions, but avoiding over-marking internals or under-marking subtle edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components (blobs) of 1s use 4-connectivity for main structure but 8-connectivity for some neighbor checks (e.g., boundary detection), which can lead to differences in how diagonals are treated—easy to miss that 8-connectivity might over-mark in tight spaces.
 * Isolated 1s (no orthogonal neighbors) should be removed or not marked as boundary, but the code removes them entirely, which might be too aggressive if they're part of noise or small objects.
 * Internal holes: Small (size <=2) 0-components fully enclosed (not touching border) need special handling—size 1 marks all 8-adjacent 1s as 7; size 2 (horizontal bar) marks sides and the row below as 7, but only if it's a straight horizontal pair; vertical or diagonal size-2 holes are ignored, which could miss cases.
 * External dents: 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in the original input) indicate indentations; mark their adjacent 1s as 7 and "fill" perpendicular to the open direction (e.g., horizontal dent fills vertically across 3 cells)—but the code uses current grid state for open direction detection, causing inconsistencies if prior steps alter it.
 * Border gaps: Border-touching 0s with exactly 2 orthogonal 1-neighbors (in input) should mark adjacent 1s as 7, but only if they're gaps, not full openings—subtlety is distinguishing from larger voids.
 * Final boundary pass: Any remaining 1 with 1-2 adjacent 0s (8-connectivity, in input) gets marked 7, catching missed edges but risking over-marking if not sequenced properly after other steps.
 * Sequencing matters: Steps like removing isolated first, then holes, dents, gaps, final pass— but using copies of input vs. current grid inconsistently leads to errors (e.g., dents check input but fill current).
 * Blobs/objects should be processed separately to avoid cross-contamination between disconnected shapes.
 * 0s remain 0 unless filled in specific cases (e.g., dents), but code sometimes sets 0s to 7 incorrectly.
 * Grids have varying sizes and multiple objects; borders and empty rows/columns are common.
 * Subtle: Some expected outputs show 7s in positions that seem internal but are actually boundary due to thin structures or holes; also, some small 1-clusters are fully marked 7 if boundary-heavy.

This is helpful for consistent neighbor counting across steps.

                blobs.append(blob)

This is essential for isolating objects and could be used to process each blob independently, avoiding global errors.

                    holes.append(hole)
    return holes
```
Helpful for identifying and classifying small enclosed 0s, but the touches_border logic is buggy (sets True inside loop but checks after—may miss multi-step border touches).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails all three training examples due to over-marking internals as 7s and under-marking some boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated marks row 4 col 0 as 7 (expected 1), row 9 cols 0-4 as 1s (expected some 7s and 0s in a hole-like structure), row 13 cols 0-3 as 7,1,1,1 (expected all 1s), and row 17 col 0 as 7 (expected 1)—over-marked left borders and missed internal hole handling in the lower object; also filled some 0s incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated marks row 2 cols 1-2 as 7,7 (expected 1,1), row 3 col 1 as 7 (expected 1), row 5 col 2 as 1 (expected 0), and row 10 col 1 as 7 (expected 1)—failed to preserve internal 1s in the main object and incorrectly marked boundaries around the central void; border gaps over-marked.
 * Train 3: Generated marks row 3 col 6 as 1 (isolated, expected 0—removal worked but perhaps shouldn't), row 4 col 4 as 1 (expected 1 but contextually part of boundary), but mainly over-marked row 4 col 1 as 7,7,7 (expected 1,1,1,1) and introduced 7s in row 11 col 2-4 (expected 1s)—isolated removal and dent processing broke thin structures; final pass over-applied.
 * remove_isolated is somewhat helpful but too early—removes noise but may alter dents/holes.
 * process_dents is broken: Open direction detection uses current grid (post-isolated/holes), not input, causing wrong fills (e.g., fills 0s to 7 in Train 1 row 5); perpendicular fill is hardcoded for vertical/horizontal but assumes single open dir (misses if multiple).
 * process_border_gaps under-marks: Counts neighbors in input but only marks adjacent 1s—doesn't fill gaps, and in Train 2 misses right-side boundaries.
 * process_internal_holes partially works for size 1 (marks adjacent), but size 2 assumes horizontal and fills below incorrectly (e.g., Train 1 row 4 hole not handled right); ignores non-horizontal size 2.
 * final_boundary_mark over-marks: Uses input 0-count on current grid 1s, catching some but turning internals near prior changes to 7 (e.g., Train 3 thin lines).
 * extract_blobs is helpful but unused in main flow—could process per-blob to avoid global issues.
 * Overall, sequencing and grid-copy inconsistencies (input vs. current) cause propagation errors; no per-blob processing leads to cross-object marking.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many internal 1s as 7s (e.g., row 4 cols 6-9 should likely be internal 1s based on structure, but marked 1,1,1,1 wait no, they are 1s but surrounding shows over-marking like row 3 col 11 as 7 where it might be internal; row 6 col 5 as 0 but context suggests possible fill needed). It also leaves some expected boundaries unmarked (e.g., the top-left shape's bottom in rows 13-15 seems under-marked, with 1s where 7s might be needed for dents), and introduces 7s in empty areas (row 2 col 10-12 as 7,7,7 but appears as a separate small object that should be handled as isolated or boundary). The central irregular shape has inconsistent outlining (e.g., row 7 col 2 as 7 but adjacent internals marked oddly), suggesting dents and holes aren't filling/perpendicular correctly, similar to training failures—likely due to same issues with sequencing and neighbor counts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing where isolated 1s are removed, background (connected to borders) is identified via flood fill, and then boundaries around enclosed "holes" (internal 0-regions surrounded by 1s) are marked by changing adjacent 1s to 7s, without altering background 0s or internal hole 0s. The goal is to highlight the edges of objects or shapes defined by 1s, treating enclosed 0s as holes and ignoring border-connected 0s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * First, remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal 1-neighbors) to clean up noise before identifying structures.
 * Use flood fill from border 0s to distinguish background 0s (connected to edges) from internal holes (enclosed 0s not reachable from borders); this is crucial to avoid marking background as part of holes.
 * For potential hole 0s, check orthogonal 1-neighbors with a threshold: 2 for border cells (to handle edge cases), 3 for internal cells (to ensure true enclosure); only proceed if threshold met.
 * Marking happens only on neighboring 1s (changed to 7s) for confirmed hole-adjacent 0s; do not mark 0s at all, even internal ones—7s are strictly for boundary 1s.
 * Use 8 directions for marking neighbors to capture diagonal boundaries, but count neighbors orthogonally (4 directions) for enclosure checks to avoid overcounting.
 * Subtlety: After removal and flood fill, use a fixed copy of the grid for counting neighbors to avoid modifying counts mid-process; process all 0s in original order.
 * Easy to miss: Do not mark background 0s or their neighbors as 7s, even if they have many 1-neighbors—this prevents "leaking" into exterior areas.
 * Another subtlety: Isolated 1s must be removed before flood fill, as they could block background propagation if not handled.
 * Border 0s should never trigger marking unless part of a shallow enclosure, but threshold helps filter.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects; process all independently.
 * No changes to 0s inside holes—they remain 0; only boundaries get 7s.
 * Potential issue: Stray 1s in output (e.g., not removed or incorrectly preserved) indicate removal step failure.
 * Consider grid size variations (e.g., 16x16, 17x17); ensure bounds checking in all loops.

                background.add((nx, ny))
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return background
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this code) correctly removes isolated 1s in most cases but fails to remove some (e.g., stray 1 in training 1 row 14, column 8, which should be 0 in expected).
 * Flood fill for background works well, as most background 0s are untouched, but the marking step incorrectly sets neighboring background 0s to 7 when processing border-adjacent 0s with high 1-neighbor counts, leading to pollution (though not heavily visible in outputs).
 * Neighbor counting uses fixed_grid correctly, but marking loops over 8 directions and applies 7s to 1s properly for holes; however, the conditional "elif output[ni][nj] == 0 and is_bg" wrongly marks background 0-neighbors as 7, which may cause minor diffs.
 * Threshold (2 on border, 3 inside) is a good intuition for enclosure but over-marks in some shallow areas, e.g., in training 2 row 8, column 13 is 1 in generated but should be 1 (no change needed? wait, diff is in other spots like row 5 column 12: generated 1, expected 0? unclear, but mismatches exist).
 * In training 1, row 12 column 7 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected—likely a boundary 1 not marked because the adjacent 0 was misclassified as background or threshold not met.
 * In training 3, row 3 column 6 is 1 in generated but 0 in expected—indicates failure to remove an isolated 1 after step 1.
 * Processing order (all 0s after fixed_grid) is helpful but doesn't iterate to propagate marks; single pass misses chained boundaries.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., connected components for 1s) was attempted, which could help verify enclosures but isn't essential; the current approach is direct but buggy in marking conditions.
 * deepcopy is used well to avoid mutation issues.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The marking for background 0-neighbors (setting 0 to 7 if is_bg) is incorrect and should be removed entirely—it's not relevant and causes potential over-marking; don't use in future.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has extensive 7-marking on what appear to be boundaries around a large central structure, which looks plausible for enclosing holes (e.g., 7s outlining a blob in rows 3-12), but includes 7s on what might be background-adjacent 1s (e.g., top-left 1s unchanged, but some 0-regions in rows 2-3 have 7s that could be overreach).
 * It does not look fully correct: stray 0s inside potential holes (e.g., row 5 column 5=0, surrounded by 7s/1s) remain 0 as expected, but some boundary 1s like row 11 column 5=7 seem correct, yet the code's background-marking bug likely adds erroneous 7s in exterior areas (e.g., row 7 column 4=0 should stay 0, but if processed as bg, neighbors might be hit—output shows 7s nearby).
 * Missing: No isolated 1 removal visible, but test input has clean 1-structures; however, the output has unbroken 1-chains where 7s should split boundaries (e.g., row 4 columns 10-12=7,0,7 looks like hole marking, but compare mentally: input has 0s in top-right, likely background, so no 7s there—generated has them, indicating over-marking).
 * To handle test: Ensure marking only triggers for non-background 0s, and use stricter enclosure (e.g., confirm full surround); generated has too many 7s in potentially open areas (rows 0-1 all 1s/0s, but row 2 has 7s that might belong to internal hole only).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving binary image processing, where the goal is to preprocess a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/shape pixels) by removing noise like thin protrusions, identifying true background vs. internal holes, marking boundaries or edges of shapes with 7s (likely to highlight contours or fill shallow features), handling specific hole types (shallow internal ones to fill/mark, deeper ones to leave), and distinguishing external dents from internal features without over-marking or misclassifying regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules: Start by cleaning the grid (e.g., remove isolated or thinly connected 1s with <2 neighbors to eliminate noise/protrusions). Identify background as all 0s connected to the grid borders via flood fill (BFS/DFS from border 0s), treating internal enclosed 0s as holes. Mark 1s adjacent (8-directional) to internal (non-background) 0s as boundaries with 7 to highlight shape edges or holes. Fill or mark "shallow" holes—defined as internal 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) but with an "open" direction leading to background or edge—by setting the hole to 7, thinning adjacent walls to 0 if needed, and propagating marks to nearby regions (e.g., perpendicular sides or outer patches). For external dents (background 0s with >=2 adjacent 1s or exactly 3 neighbors), mark adjacent 1s as 7 without filling the dent itself, and extend marks horizontally/vertically if the dent opens to background.
 * Subtleties: Background flood fill must avoid marking internal holes as background; use visited array and only seed from border 0s. Shallow holes require checking "opposing" directions (e.g., if a wall 1 leads outward to background, fill the hole and mark/thin accordingly), but avoid over-filling deeper holes (e.g., those not directly open). External dents should not propagate marks into internal areas; use 4-directional for neighbor counts but 8 for adjacency checks. Thin protrusions are only removed if they have <2 1-neighbors (isolated or diagonal-only connections don't count as connected). Order matters: clean protrusions first, then background ID, then hole handling, then boundary marking, then dents—misordering can cascade errors (e.g., marking before cleaning leaves noise). 7s seem to represent "marked/filled boundary" but should not overwrite 1s unless thinning; avoid setting background 0s to 7 except in specific fills. Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; process all uniformly. Edge cases: fully enclosed shapes, 1-pixel holes/protrusions, diagonal connections (use 4-dir for connectivity, 8 for adjacency), and border-touching holes (treat as external/not shallow).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction needed (grids are small, process in-place); focus on topological features like connectivity and depth. Iterations may be needed for multi-layer holes, but single pass seems sufficient. Directions: 4-dir for orthogonal connectivity (e.g., neighbor counts for thinness/holes), 8-dir for boundary adjacency to catch diagonals. Outputs must preserve original 1/0 structure except for targeted 7 marks/fills—over-marking turns valid shapes into boundaries. Unknowns: Exact depth threshold for "shallow" (code assumes 1-layer, but may need recursion); why some expected 0s stay 0 while adjacent 1s get 7 (e.g., deep holes untouched).

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `handle_shallow_holes`: Overly complex and buggy—tries to fill 0s with 4 1-neighbors by checking "open" directions and propagating marks, but misfires (e.g., sets wrong outer patches to 7, thins incorrectly, marks perpendicular sides prematurely). Fills background-adjacent areas and creates artifacts; not handling depth properly leads to over-filling.
- `handle_external_dents`: Marks background 0s with >=2 or ==3 1-neighbors by setting adjacent 1s to 7 and extending horizontally/vertically, but propagates into internal regions and doesn't distinguish dent "openness" well (e.g., marks valid external 1s as boundaries). Condition for num_adj==3 assumes single open dir but fails on corners/diagonals; broken for multi-dent shapes.
- `is_on_border`: Unused in main program; simplistic (only checks edges) and not needed since background flood fill handles borders implicitly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in hole/dent handling despite good background ID and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated over-marks top-left 7s (e.g., row 0 cols 2-4 as 7,7,7 vs. expected 7,0,7; row 2 col 16 as 7 vs. 0) and adds extra 7s in bottom shapes (e.g., row 17 col 14 as 0,7,1 vs. expected 7,0,7,1—flipped hole mark); also fills row 5 entirely with 7s where expected has sparse 7s and 0s. What worked: Correctly identified some internal boundaries (e.g., row 1 cols 14-16 as 7,7). What didn't: Shallow hole logic filled external dents as internal and propagated wrongly (unknown why row 5 over-filled, possibly background mis-ID).
 * Train 2: Generated marks entire top/middle as 7s (e.g., row 2 all 7s vs. expected all 1s; row 3 cols 1-13 as 7,0s vs. expected 1,0s) and adds spurious 7s in bottom hole (e.g., row 7 col 9 as 0 vs. expected 0, but surrounds wrong). What worked: Some external dent marking (e.g., row 15 all 1s correct). What didn't: Boundary marking over-applied to non-hole areas; thin protrusion removal missed large 0-regions, treating them as shallow holes (unknown cascade from order).
 * Train 3: Generated adds outer 7-frame around shape (e.g., row 3 cols 3-15 as 7s vs. expected 0s; row 4 col 3 as 7 vs. 0) and over-marks internals (e.g., row 6 col 11 as 0 vs. expected 0, but adjacent 7s wrong). What worked: Some internal hole boundaries marked (e.g., row 6 cols 9-11 as 7,0,7 matching expected). What didn't: Dent handling marked border-adjacent 1s as 7 prematurely; protrusion removal insufficient, leaving stubs that triggered false boundaries.
 * Overall: Background flood fill works (correct in isolated tests, avoids internals). Neighbor counting solid. But handling functions broken—shallow fills propagate to background, dents mark too broadly, no iteration for multi-step cleans. No object extraction attempted (not needed, as global processing suffices). Program order exposes cleaned grid to flawed handlers, causing 7-overload.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks with 7s in ways inconsistent with training expectations, such as filling large internal regions (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 6-12 as all 7s, likely a mis-filled "hole" that's actually shape body) and adding spurious 0s/7s in bottom (e.g., row 11 cols 11-13 as 7,7,7 vs. probable need for sparser boundaries). External edges have inconsistent thinning (e.g., row 0 col 5 as 7,0s vs. expected clean 1s or marked only at dents). It resembles training failures: background ID probably correct, but shallow/dent logic cascades to mark valid 1s as 7 and leave deep holes unmarked. To fix for test: Refine shallow check to require explicit "outer open" to background (not just edge), limit propagation to 1-step, and apply dent marking only after all internals—test has complex nested shapes (e.g., central 1s with 0-dents), so need better depth (e.g., distance from background >1 for internal).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a binary grid (0s for empty/background, 1s for filled pixels, likely representing shapes or blobs in a larger image) to simulate some kind of boundary detection, gap-filling, or shape refinement rule. The goal is to output a modified grid where isolated 1s are removed (set to 0), small gaps (size 1 or 2, horizontal or vertical) in connected 1-regions are "bridged" by marking the flanking 1s (and sometimes the gap itself) with 7s to indicate boundaries or connections, and these 7 markings propagate to adjacent rows/columns only if those segments are uniform (all 1s or all 0s), with multiple passes to handle interactions between horizontal and vertical directions; the result highlights structure while preserving the overall shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 4-connected 1-neighbors) as single-pixel "Blues" or noise disappear; this happens first and is straightforward.
 * Gap-bridging: For horizontal/vertical gaps of size 1 or 2 between 1s, mark the flanking 1s with 7 (to denote boundaries or connections), but do not fill the gap with 1s—keep it as 0s; this is not true filling but marking edges for visual emphasis.
 * Edge cases: Handle gaps at grid edges (left/right for horizontal, top/bottom for vertical) separately, as they lack one side; e.g., a size-1 gap at left edge (0 followed by 1) marks the adjacent 1 as 7.
 * Propagation subtlety: After marking 7s for a gap, propagate to adjacent rows (for horizontal gaps) or columns (for vertical gaps) only over the exact segment length (e.g., 3 cells for size-1 gap, 4 for size-2), and only if that segment is uniform (all 1s or all 0s in the original values); this prevents over-marking mixed areas and simulates "uniform extension" of boundaries.
 * Multiple passes: Apply horizontal gap handling, then vertical, then repeat (at least once) to catch interactions, like a horizontal gap creating a vertical one or vice versa; without passes, some markings miss.
 * Directions: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for neighbor counting, but gap detection is strictly linear (row-wise for horizontal, column-wise for vertical).
 * No diagonal handling: Gaps and propagation are axis-aligned only; no 8-connected or diagonal propagation, which could explain some missed connections.
 * Uniformity check: For propagation, use "all(v == 1) or all(v == 0)" or equivalent (len(set(vals)) == 1); this is key to avoid marking non-uniform areas, but it's easy to miss that 7s already present might break uniformity if not handled carefully.
 * Grid size variations: Grids are rectangular but not always square; handle empty or small grids gracefully; examples vary from 16x16 to 16x17-ish.
 * Subtle over-marking risk: Propagation can chain incorrectly if not using copies or if passes over-apply; e.g., a marked 7 in an adjacent row might then trigger further gaps.
 * No object extraction needed: While connected components might help identify blobs, the rules seem local (per row/column), not global; attempting full object extraction (e.g., flood-fill) could be overkill or unhelpful here.
 * 7 as marker only: 7s do not count as 1s for neighbor counting or uniformity (treat as distinct); final output keeps 0s, 1s, and 7s without converting back.
 * Isolated after marking: Removals happen only at start; later 1s aren't re-checked for isolation, even if markings isolate them.
 * Potential missed rules: Some examples suggest vertical gaps might propagate differently (e.g., in train 2, expected has 1s where generated has 7s, possibly no marking in certain blob interiors); horizontal size-2 might not always propagate fully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

directions_4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
```
(This defines 4-connected directions, useful for neighbor counting; essential for isolation check.)

```python
def count_neighbors(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]], target_values: Tuple[int, ...] = (1,)) -> int:
    """Count adjacent cells matching target_values in given directions. Handles observation of isolated cells."""
    count = 0
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] in target_values:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is helpful and correct for checking 1-neighbors; used in isolation removal; could extend to other counts if needed.)

```python
def remove_isolated(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove 1s with zero 4-connected 1-neighbors (isolated pixels). Based on observation that single-pixel Blues disappear."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if new_grid[i][j] == 1 and count_neighbors(new_grid, i, j, rows, cols, directions_4, (1,)) == 0:
                new_grid[i][j] = 0
    return new_grid
```
(This works well; correctly removes isolates without side effects; apply first in main program.)

(The gap-handling functions like handle_horizontal_size1_gaps, handle_vertical_gaps, etc., are partially helpful as they detect gaps correctly but over-propagate 7s due to uniformity checks or pass ordering; the composition in handle_horizontal_gaps and multiple passes in program() are good ideas but buggy in execution. Edge handlers like handle_horizontal_edge_gaps are useful for boundaries but need tighter uniformity checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly removes isolated 1s in all examples (no differences noted in isolates).
 * Gap detection works for many size-1 and size-2 cases, e.g., in train 1 rows 0-5 and 9-13, most 7s match expected positions.
 * Multiple passes (horiz then vert then repeat) capture some interactions, like propagating across directions.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly matches but differs in row 11 (pos 5: 7 vs expected 0, over-marked during vertical propagation?); row 14 (pos 8: 7 vs all 0s, spurious propagation from above); row 17 (pos 8: 7 vs 1, and pos 13: 7 vs 1? Wait, expected has 7 at 13 but generated has it early—mismatch in horizontal gap detection); reason unknown but likely over-propagation in vertical_size1_gaps.
 * Train 2: Major mismatches, e.g., row 2: generated has 7s at pos 1-2 vs expected 1s (failed to skip interior uniform 1s?); row 5: generated 7s at pos 6-12 vs expected 1s (over-marked a non-gap area as gap); row 6: generated 1 at pos 6 vs expected 1, but 7s propagate wrongly; row 8: pos 13: 7 vs expected 1 (extra marking); suggests propagation condition too loose, marking uniform 1-blocks incorrectly.
 * Train 3: Minor mismatches, e.g., row 3: generated has 1 at pos 6 vs expected 0 (failed to remove a near-isolate?); row 6: pos 12: 7 vs expected 7, but pos 11: 0 vs 7? Wait, generated [...,7,0,7,...] expected [...,0,7,7,...]—shifted 7 placement; row 7: pos 12: 0 vs 7; likely edge in vertical gap handling misaligns.
 * Function `handle_horizontal_size2_gaps` and similar are helpful for detection but broken in propagation (applies to non-gaps or over-uniform checks); don't use without fixing uniformity to strictly original values before marking.
 * No object extraction function present, but not needed—local row/column scans suffice; adding flood-fill would be unhelpful and complicate.
 * Overall, isolation and basic gap marking work (partial understanding), but propagation over-marks interiors and misses exact uniformity, causing all trains to fail.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-marks with 7s in ways that don't align with expected patterns from trainings (e.g., row 2 has 7s at pos 10-12, but if this is a gap, propagation to row 3 seems excessive with 7 at pos 11; row 8 has 7s spreading horizontally where a vertical gap might not warrant it).
 * It misses potential vertical gap bridging in cols 5-7 (e.g., row 0-1 are 0s, but row 2 has 0s—should mark flanking if size-2, but instead marks unrelated areas like row 9 pos 11).
 * Extra 7s in row 10 (pos 5-7) look like over-propagation from a horizontal gap, similar to train failures; the output fragments the main blob with unnecessary 7s (e.g., row 4 pos 4-6: 7s where expected might keep 1s for uniformity).
 * To handle test, need stricter propagation (only if adjacent segment exactly matches the gap's flanking pattern, not just uniform) and more passes or reverse-order application to avoid chaining errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a binary grid processing puzzle focused on cleaning and annotating pixel art or shape representations, where isolated 1s (foreground pixels) are removed, boundaries around fully enclosed 0-holes (internal voids) are marked with 7s, and small background dents or protrusions are filled/marked to smooth shapes, while preserving the overall structure of connected 1-components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s iteratively if they have zero orthogonal (4-dir) 1-neighbors, but only after or before other steps to avoid over-removal in connected groups.
 * Distinguish background 0s (connected to border via 4-connectivity flood fill) from enclosed holes (internal 0s not reachable from border); enclosed holes are identified if they have >=3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (or >=2 if on border, though border holes may be treated as background).
 * For enclosed holes, mark all 8-dir adjacent 1s as 7 to highlight boundaries, but do not fill the hole itself (keep as 0).
 * For background 0s that are "dents" (high 1-neighbors: >=3 internal, >=2 on border), mark adjacent 1s as 7 and potentially fill adjacent low-neighbor background 0s (0 1-neighbors) with 7 to smooth jagged edges, but avoid over-filling large background areas.
 * Process steps in order: clean isolated first, then mark hole boundaries, then handle dents; use copies to avoid modifying during iteration.
 * Subtle: On-border 0s with fewer neighbors might still be dents if they protrude into shapes; avoid marking background-adjacent 1s unless specifically tied to dents/holes; 8-dir for boundary marking but 4-dir for connectivity/neighbor counts to match standard blob analysis.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected shapes; preserve all unless isolated; no rotation/scaling, just in-place modification.
 * Edge cases: Single-pixel holes, diagonal-only connections (not counted as enclosed if 4-connectivity), large empty grids, or shapes touching borders (their "holes" may be background).

```
(Note: These are from the attempt and seem core/helpful for neighbor counting, background detection, and isolation removal; minor tweaks like avoiding duplicate seeds in flood fill could help.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `mark_boundaries_around_enclosed_holes`: Broken – incorrectly marks 1s adjacent to enclosed 0s but uses flawed criteria (e.g., marks on-border holes as enclosed, leading to extra 7s); does not properly exclude background-adjacent cases and over-marks in example 1 row 5 (generated has isolated 7s, expected has clustered 7s) and example 3 row 3 (generated keeps stray 1, expected removes it entirely?).
 * `fill_and_mark_small_dents`: Partially broken – over-fills or mis-marks background dents, e.g., in example 1 row 14 (generated places erroneous 1 in background, expected all 0s) and row 16 (generated has single 7, expected three 7s); condition for filling low-neighbor 0s (neigh1==0) is too narrow and doesn't propagate fills properly; in example 2, it fails to mark a key 1 as 7 in row 8 col 13 (generated 1, expected 7? Wait, expected has 1 there, but other mismatches suggest dent handling is off).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes steps in logical order (isolate removal -> hole marking -> dent filling) but fails all training examples due to bugs in hole/dent detection.
 * Worked: Isolated 1 removal seems functional (e.g., example 3 row 3 generated removes most but misses context); background flood fill identifies large 0-regions correctly in examples 1 and 2.
 * Did not work: Hole marking over-applies to border-adjacent 0s (example 1 row 5: generated [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,...], missing cluster of 7s); dent filling adds erroneous 1s or misplaced 7s (example 1 row 14: generated has 1 at col 8, expected 0; row 12: generated 7 at end, expected in middle at col 7).
 * Example 2 mismatches in row 8 col 13 (generated 1, expected 1? But overall incorrect, possibly due to under-marking dent boundaries) and row 9 col 13 (generated 1, expected 1, but dent in rows 13-15 not fully marked with 7s in right positions).
 * Example 3: Fails to remove a stray 1 in row 3 col 6 (generated keeps it, expected all 0s there); dent in row 13 (generated no 7s, expected 7s at cols 6-8); suggests isolation removal doesn't propagate or hole marking misses small internal 0s.
 * No object extraction function present, but one could be added to identify connected 1-components for per-shape processing; current global approach misses shape-specific rules.
 * Flood fill seeds duplicates on corners, potentially inefficient but not breaking; neighbor counts are accurate but thresholds (e.g., >=3 for holes) too rigid for border cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct – it marks excessive 7s in what appears to be a single large shape with possible internal hole or dent (rows 4-11 show clustered 7s around 0s, but over-marks borders like row 2 col 11=7 where it might be background protrusion).
 * Missing proper dent filling: Row 12 has 0s and isolated 7s ([1,1,1,1,1,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]), suggesting incomplete smoothing of jagged background edges; expected likely fills row 12 cols 6-8 with 7s similar to example 1 row 16.
 * Extra markings: Rows 0-2 and 12-15 have 7s in positions that seem like boundary overreach (e.g., row 2 col 11=7 next to 0s, but if background, should not mark adjacent 1s unless dent); looks like hole marking treated border 0s as enclosed.
 * Overall, output has too many scattered 7s and unfilled dents (e.g., row 5 col 5=0 with surrounding 7s/1s suggests unresolved hole), unlike cleaner expected patterns in training where 7s cluster tightly around internals; does not match inferred rules as shape in cols 0-4 rows 0-15 seems solid but gets boundary noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing binary grids (0s and 1s representing empty space and filled shapes/objects) to clean up irregular features like thin protrusions, identify and mark small gaps or runs of 0s (possibly "cracks" or "holes" in shapes), and highlight adjacent areas using 7s, likely to emphasize boundaries, small defects, or connectable gaps without altering the core structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents shapes or "blobs" of 1s surrounded by 0s; the goal is to preserve main shapes while removing or marking minor irregularities like thin lines (protrusions with <2 neighbors) and small 0-runs (<=2 consecutive 0s in rows, possibly indicating narrow gaps).
 * 7s are used to "mark" or highlight specific 1s adjacent (using 8 directions) to small 0-runs, but only if they touch the run; overmarking internal 1s as 7s (e.g., solid blocks) is incorrect, as seen in examples where expected output keeps core 1s unchanged.
 * Single 0-gaps between 1s in rows should trigger marking of nearby 0s above/below (if they form a small empty area of 3 consecutive 0s), but only if flanked by 1s; this seems aimed at filling or noting bridgeable gaps, but must not propagate to larger empty areas or alter non-gap 1s.
 * Cleaning must be iterative and only remove isolated/thin 1s (<2 orthogonal neighbors), but stop before eroding main shapes; subtle: use 4 directions for cleaning to avoid diagonal erosion, but 8 for marking to catch diagonal adjacencies.
 * Grids have borders of 0s or 1s in some cases (e.g., full rows of 1s or 0s); do not mark border 1s unless they directly border small internal 0-runs.
 * Subtle elements: Small 0-runs are row-specific (horizontal only in current code), but may need vertical/hole detection; avoid marking in large empty areas (runs >2); 7s should not replace 0s in core empty spaces or create new 1s—only overlay on existing 1s or specific 0s.
 * Order matters: Clean protrusions first, then fill/mark gaps on the cleaned grid; running marking before cleaning can propagate errors.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-cell gaps vs. protrusions; diagonal connections shouldn't trigger cleaning but may for marking; no global connectivity (e.g., flood fill) yet, but may be needed to distinguish separate objects.
 * Across attempts: No object extraction yet, but shapes seem like letters/symbols (e.g., ex2 looks like a figure with arms/legs); 7s highlight "defects" like small holes or thin parts without removing them.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly handles training example 1, preserving a clean shape with appropriate 7s on small edge gaps.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated overmarks some 1s as 7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs expected1; row5 col13:7 vs1; row6 col12:0 but marks surrounding as7 incorrectly; row8 col13:7 vs0? Wait, expected has1 there but generated7; row9 col13:1 vs0—mismatch); under-marks others (e.g., row6 col12 should be1 but generated0, missing7 nearby); fill_single_gaps marks too aggressively in vertical gaps, turning solid1s into7s; mark_small_zero_runs catches horizontal runs<=2 but misses vertical/diagonal contexts, leading to extra7s in row7-9 cols7-10.
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated over-erodes or over-marks core1s as7s (e.g., row4 col13:7 vs1; row5 col9-11:7,7,7 vs1,1,1; row6 col11:7 vs7? but row6 col12:7 vs0 mismatch; row7 col11:0 vs0 ok but surrounding7s extra; row8 col10:1 vs1 ok but row8 col11-12:7,7 vs7,7 ok—partial; row12 col6-8:7,7,7 vs7,7,7 ok); cleaning removes too little (shape intact but marking turns internal "thick" parts to7s); fill_single_gaps incorrectly fills non-single gaps or propagates to borders.
 * clean_thin_protrusions is helpful and correct for ex1 (removes isolates without harming main blob), but may not handle "thin but connected" arms in ex2/ex3 (e.g., doesn't remove enough in vertical thin parts).
 * mark_small_zero_runs is partially helpful for horizontal small gaps but broken for overmarking (uses8-dir on any adjacent1, hitting internals; should check if1 is "edge" or limit to run ends); doesn't handle vertical runs.
 * fill_single_gaps is unhelpful/broken: Only checks horizontal single0s flanked by1s, then marks3-wide0s above/below if all0—but in ex2/ex3, this creates extra7s in larger empty areas (e.g., ex3 row5-6 gaps marked wrongly); doesn't fill the gap itself (sets output on0s to7, but expected keeps some0s); ignores vertical singles; not relevant if puzzle is about marking borders, not filling.
 * No object extraction function yet, but needed for future: Separate blobs to process independently (e.g., via flood fill) to avoid cross-marking; current code treats whole grid as one, causing issues in multi-object grids like ex3 (multiple shapes?).
 * Overall: Core cleaning works (ex1 pass), but marking logic misses subtlety of "small defects only" (overmarks thick/internal1s); no vertical gap detection; order of fill/mark causes propagation errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it overmarks internal and thick parts of the main shape with7s (e.g., row3 cols10-12:7,7,7 seem like marking a small horizontal0-run above, but expected likely keeps core1s as1s per ex2/ex3 patterns; row4 col11:0 isolated but surrounded by7s—may be underfilled; row5 cols4-6:7,7,7 on what looks like a thick arm, turning it to marked when expected probably keeps as1 like ex3's main body; row7 col3:7 on edge ok, but row8 col4:0 vs expected? possibly a gap but overpropagates to row8 cols11-13:7,7,7 internal); large empty right side (cols14-15 all0) unmarked ok, but left border1s (cols0-4) mostly preserved except scattered7s (e.g., row11 col5:7 ok for gap, but row12 col8:7? may be extra). It makes partial sense for marking small gaps/protrusions (e.g., row2-3 small7 cluster near center), but fails on subtlety of not marking solid cores—similar to ex3 overmarking—suggesting needs better gap size limits and vertical checks; without expected, it visually disrupts the shape more than highlights defects.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
