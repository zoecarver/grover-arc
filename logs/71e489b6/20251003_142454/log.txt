=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:24:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:30:43] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled cells) through morphological-like operations: removing "thin protrusions" (isolated or barely connected 1s), removing fully isolated 1s, and then highlighting (coloring to 7) any remaining 1s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to small connected components of 0s (size 1 or 2, using 4-connectivity for zeros but 8-connectivity for adjacency checks). The goal is likely to clean up noise in a visual pattern or identify boundaries/features around small holes or gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are rectangular lists of lists with consistent dimensions; assume 0s are background/empty, 1s are foreground/object pixels.
 * Connectivity for zero components uses 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for BFS/flood fill to find small enclosed or open spaces (size <=2).
 * Adjacency for coloring uses 8 directions (including diagonals) to mark 1s touching these small zero components, but only after prior cleaning steps.
 * Cleaning happens sequentially: first remove thin protrusions (1s with >=3 zero neighbors in 4 directions, indicating tips or spurs), then remove isolated 1s (those with 0 one-neighbors in 4 directions).
 * Subtlety: Cleaning modifies a copy of the grid, but coloring uses the original grid for zero detection (to preserve original small holes) while applying to the cleaned grid.
 * Potential misses: Over-removal if protrusions are checked simultaneously without iteration (single pass may leave remnants); small zero components might be open edges, not just enclosed holes; no handling for larger zero components (they shouldn't trigger coloring); diagonal adjacency is key for "touching" but not for zero connectivity.
 * Edge cases: Border cells have fewer neighbors; multiple small zero components per grid; after cleaning, some 1s might become isolated but aren't re-checked; output should preserve 0s and change only specific 1s to 7 (no other values).
 * General: Single-pass operations avoid infinite loops; use BFS for exact component sizing/collection; visited arrays prevent re-processing.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a sequential pipeline (protrusions -> isolated -> coloring), which aligns with cleaning before highlighting, but fails entirely due to a syntax error in color_adjacent_to_small_zeros (incomplete if-block after first BFS attempt, line 61).
 * remove_thin_protrusions and remove_isolated are syntactically correct and likely work for their parts (single-pass neighbor counting in 4 directions), but untested due to overall error.
 * color_adjacent_to_small_zeros correctly identifies the need for BFS on original g for zeros, collection of small components (<=2), and 8-dir adjacency coloring on cleaned grid, but the code is broken (first BFS lacks body/indentation, leading to execution error; second BFS is good but orphaned).
 * No outputs generated for any example, so nothing "worked" in terms of producing grids; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) resulted in identical ERROR messages.
 * The main_program orchestrates steps correctly (temp_g for cleaning, result for coloring), but inherits the syntax issue.
 * No extraction of objects or other helper functions attempted; focus is purely on grid modifications.
 * Subtle issue: Single-pass cleaning might not handle chained dependencies (e.g., removing a protrusion could isolate another 1), but not addressed here.
 * Train examples 1-3 and test all failed identically (no grids output), differing from expected by not executing at all—expected would be modified grids with 0/1/7 values highlighting small-zero-adjacent areas after cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (syntax failure), so it does not make sense or look correct—it produced no grid at all, just a traceback about indentation after an if-statement.
 * Without execution, it can't match any expected cleaned/highlighted grid; for instance, if the test input has thin 1s, isolated points, or small zero gaps, the output should show removals (to 0) and colorings (to 7), but nothing was generated to compare.
 * This indicates the program can't handle the test input (or any input) due to the bug, missing all puzzle effects like protrusion removal or small-zero highlighting.

[2025-10-03 14:30:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:35:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the input to remove isolated 1s and then identify and mark specific enclosed or patterned regions by changing certain 1s to 7s, likely to highlight boundaries, fills, or shapes like loops, bays, or internal areas. The output preserves the overall structure but annotates detectable features, with 7s indicating processed or filled elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't form part of larger structures.
 * For 0 cells (empty spaces), detect surrounding 1s in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) to identify enclosures: full surround (4 neighbors) fills all eight surrounding cells with 7 if they are 1s; 3 neighbors indicate an open bay, filling closed sides and interior/exterior based on open direction, with conditions for low-adjacency cells; 2 neighbors handle corner-like or L-shaped opens by filling specific adjacent 1s.
 * Subtlety in 3-neighbor case: Interior fill is always 3 cells in the closed direction, but exterior/open-side fill only applies if the open-side cell is internal (0) and has <2 neighbors, or if already 1 (always fill); this prevents overfilling unbounded areas.
 * Subtlety in 2-neighbor case: Only specific diagonal pairs of neighbors (e.g., left+down but not up+right) trigger fills of 3-cell L-shapes, ignoring other configurations like straight lines or opposites.
 * Process in a single pass over 0 cells, using mutable out grid; order matters as changes affect later checks (top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
 * No diagonal neighbor checks for isolation or basic adjacency—only orthogonal for core logic, but eight directions for some fills.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16), with many empty rows/columns; preserve all 0s unless part of a pattern fill.
 * 7s seem to mark "claimed" or boundary/interior cells without removing them, suggesting annotation rather than erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Conditional fills in open directions only apply to low-adjacency 0s (<2 neighbors) to avoid filling unrelated empty space; also, is_internal check limits open-side fills.
 * No handling for num_1 == 1 or 0 cases explicitly beyond isolation removal.
 * Potential overreach: Code modifies 1s to 7s even if not enclosed, based on local 0-cell views, which can propagate incorrectly in complex shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_neighbor(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, di: int, dj: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    ni = i + di
    nj = j + dj
    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
        return g[ni][nj]
    return 0
```
(This is useful for safe boundary-checked neighbor access, used in isolation and pattern detection.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if get_neighbor(out, i, j, di, dj) == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This correctly removes isolated 1s based on orthogonal neighbors and is likely working well, as no differences noted in isolations across examples.)

The handle_patterns function is partially helpful for enclosure detection but broken in specifics (see below); no extraction of full objects/shapes yet, which might be needed for global context like connected components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements isolated 1 removal, which works as no isolated 1s appear in generated outputs where they shouldn't.
 * Pattern handling partially works for some full enclosures (num_1==4), as seen in training 1 where top-left and bottom shapes have some 7 fills matching expected, but fails on partial opens (num_1==3/2), leading to under/over-filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated has extra 1s in row 11 (positions 5-6 should be 7 and 0 per expected, but are 0 and 0—underfilled); row 12 has 7,1,1 instead of 7,7,7 (underfilled interior); row 13 all 1s except expected has 7s in positions 4-7 (missed horizontal fill); row 14 has extra 7s in positions 7-8 (overfilled where expected is all 1s); bottom shape in rows 16-17 matches expected fills.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrectly fills row 2 with 1s where expected has 1s but misses some 7s (e.g., positions 1-2 should be 1s but code put 7s? Wait, row 2 is [1,7,7,1,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,...]—overfilled early); row 5 has 7,7,0 vs expected 0,0,0 (overfilled sides); row 10 has 1,1,0 vs expected 1,1,0 (matches but later mismatches); row 12 all 1s vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (minor); row 13 has 7,0,0 vs expected 7,7,7,7 (underfilled); overall, code detects some vertical fills but misses horizontal enclosures and overfills bays.
 * Training example 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 3 position 6 with 7 (isolated? but expected 0); row 4 has 1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1 (overfilled); row 7 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7 (mismatch in positions 11-12: 7,0 vs 0,7—shifted fill); row 8 similar shift; row 9 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1 (underfilled position 6); bottom rows match expected fills, suggesting vertical patterns work better than horizontal.
 * No object extraction function present, which might help identify connected 1-components for global enclosure detection instead of local 0-cell checks.
 * The 2-neighbor logic only handles specific L-shapes but misses straight or opposite pairs, leading to underfilling in linear opens (e.g., training 2 row 13 underfill).
 * Single pass mutation causes order-dependent errors, like early fills affecting later num_1 counts (unknown if this caused specific mismatches, but likely in complex shapes).
 * No reversal or iterative passes, so partial fills don't propagate (e.g., training 1 row 12 underfill).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in ways that suggest partial enclosure detection (e.g., vertical fills in columns 4-5 rows 2-12 look like bay handling, horizontal in row 4-5), but it does not look fully correct—many areas seem underfilled or overfilled compared to likely expected (based on training patterns), such as row 5 having 7,7,7,1,... which might overfill an open area, and row 9-10 having scattered 7s in a dense 1 block that expected might keep more as 1s for unprocessed shapes.
 * Missing fills in bottom-left enclosure (rows 10-12, columns 5-7 should likely have more 7s for interior if it's a bay, but has 7,0,7—underfilled like training 3).
 * Overfills in row 2 position 4 with 7 where it might be open (similar to training 2 overfill); right-side 7s in rows 2-10 column 10 seem correct for a separate shape, but without expected, hard to confirm—however, inconsistencies with training suggest it's not handling mixed horizontal/vertical opens well.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates the same flaws as trainings (local over/under-fills), so it likely doesn't match expected; needs better global shape detection to avoid local errors.

[2025-10-03 14:35:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled cells) through morphological-like operations: removing "thin protrusions" (isolated or barely connected 1s), removing fully isolated 1s, and then highlighting (coloring to 7) any remaining 1s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to small connected components of 0s (size 1 or 2, using 4-connectivity for zeros but 8-connectivity for adjacency checks). The goal is likely to clean up noise in a visual pattern or identify boundaries/features around small holes or gaps.

 * Grids are rectangular lists of lists with consistent dimensions; assume 0s are background/empty, 1s are foreground/object pixels.
 * Connectivity for zero components uses 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for BFS/flood fill to find small enclosed or open spaces (size <=2).
 * Adjacency for coloring uses 8 directions (including diagonals) to mark 1s touching these small zero components, but only after prior cleaning steps.
 * Cleaning happens sequentially: first remove thin protrusions (1s with >=3 zero neighbors in 4 directions, indicating tips or spurs), then remove isolated 1s (those with 0 one-neighbors in 4 directions).
 * Subtlety: Cleaning modifies a copy of the grid, but coloring uses the original grid for zero detection (to preserve original small holes) while applying to the cleaned grid.
 * Potential misses: Over-removal if protrusions are checked simultaneously without iteration (single pass may leave remnants); small zero components might be open edges, not just enclosed holes; no handling for larger zero components (they shouldn't trigger coloring); diagonal adjacency is key for "touching" but not for zero connectivity.
 * Edge cases: Border cells have fewer neighbors; multiple small zero components per grid; after cleaning, some 1s might become isolated but aren't re-checked; output should preserve 0s and change only specific 1s to 7 (no other values).
 * General: Single-pass operations avoid infinite loops; use BFS for exact component sizing/collection; visited arrays prevent re-processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a sequential pipeline (protrusions -> isolated -> coloring), which aligns with cleaning before highlighting, but fails entirely due to a syntax error in color_adjacent_to_small_zeros (incomplete if-block after first BFS attempt, line 61).
 * remove_thin_protrusions and remove_isolated are syntactically correct and likely work for their parts (single-pass neighbor counting in 4 directions), but untested due to overall error.
 * color_adjacent_to_small_zeros correctly identifies the need for BFS on original g for zeros, collection of small components (<=2), and 8-dir adjacency coloring on cleaned grid, but the code is broken (first BFS lacks body/indentation, leading to execution error; second BFS is good but orphaned).
 * No outputs generated for any example, so nothing "worked" in terms of producing grids; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) resulted in identical ERROR messages.
 * The main_program orchestrates steps correctly (temp_g for cleaning, result for coloring), but inherits the syntax issue.
 * No extraction of objects or other helper functions attempted; focus is purely on grid modifications.
 * Subtle issue: Single-pass cleaning might not handle chained dependencies (e.g., removing a protrusion could isolate another 1), but not addressed here.
 * Train examples 1-3 and test all failed identically (no grids output), differing from expected by not executing at all—expected would be modified grids with 0/1/7 values highlighting small-zero-adjacent areas after cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (syntax failure), so it does not make sense or look correct—it produced no grid at all, just a traceback about indentation after an if-statement.
 * Without execution, it can't match any expected cleaned/highlighted grid; for instance, if the test input has thin 1s, isolated points, or small zero gaps, the output should show removals (to 0) and colorings (to 7), but nothing was generated to compare.
 * This indicates the program can't handle the test input (or any input) due to the bug, missing all puzzle effects like protrusion removal or small-zero highlighting.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the input to remove isolated 1s and then identify and mark specific enclosed or patterned regions by changing certain 1s to 7s, likely to highlight boundaries, fills, or shapes like loops, bays, or internal areas. The output preserves the overall structure but annotates detectable features, with 7s indicating processed or filled elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't form part of larger structures.
 * For 0 cells (empty spaces), detect surrounding 1s in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) to identify enclosures: full surround (4 neighbors) fills all eight surrounding cells with 7 if they are 1s; 3 neighbors indicate an open bay, filling closed sides and interior/exterior based on open direction, with conditions for low-adjacency cells; 2 neighbors handle corner-like or L-shaped opens by filling specific adjacent 1s.
 * Subtlety in 3-neighbor case: Interior fill is always 3 cells in the closed direction, but exterior/open-side fill only applies if the open-side cell is internal (0) and has <2 neighbors, or if already 1 (always fill); this prevents overfilling unbounded areas.
 * Subtlety in 2-neighbor case: Only specific diagonal pairs of neighbors (e.g., left+down but not up+right) trigger fills of 3-cell L-shapes, ignoring other configurations like straight lines or opposites.
 * Process in a single pass over 0 cells, using mutable out grid; order matters as changes affect later checks (top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
 * No diagonal neighbor checks for isolation or basic adjacency—only orthogonal for core logic, but eight directions for some fills.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16), with many empty rows/columns; preserve all 0s unless part of a pattern fill.
 * 7s seem to mark "claimed" or boundary/interior cells without removing them, suggesting annotation rather than erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Conditional fills in open directions only apply to low-adjacency 0s (<2 neighbors) to avoid filling unrelated empty space; also, is_internal check limits open-side fills.
 * No handling for num_1 == 1 or 0 cases explicitly beyond isolation removal.
 * Potential overreach: Code modifies 1s to 7s even if not enclosed, based on local 0-cell views, which can propagate incorrectly in complex shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_neighbor(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, di: int, dj: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    ni = i + di
    nj = j + dj
    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
        return g[ni][nj]
    return 0
```
(This is useful for safe boundary-checked neighbor access, used in isolation and pattern detection.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if get_neighbor(out, i, j, di, dj) == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This correctly removes isolated 1s based on orthogonal neighbors and is likely working well, as no differences noted in isolations across examples.)

The handle_patterns function is partially helpful for enclosure detection but broken in specifics (see below); no extraction of full objects/shapes yet, which might be needed for global context like connected components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements isolated 1 removal, which works as no isolated 1s appear in generated outputs where they shouldn't.
 * Pattern handling partially works for some full enclosures (num_1==4), as seen in training 1 where top-left and bottom shapes have some 7 fills matching expected, but fails on partial opens (num_1==3/2), leading to under/over-filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated has extra 1s in row 11 (positions 5-6 should be 7 and 0 per expected, but are 0 and 0—underfilled); row 12 has 7,1,1 instead of 7,7,7 (underfilled interior); row 13 all 1s except expected has 7s in positions 4-7 (missed horizontal fill); row 14 has extra 7s in positions 7-8 (overfilled where expected is all 1s); bottom shape in rows 16-17 matches expected fills.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrectly fills row 2 with 1s where expected has 1s but misses some 7s (e.g., positions 1-2 should be 1s but code put 7s? Wait, row 2 is [1,7,7,1,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,...]—overfilled early); row 5 has 7,7,0 vs expected 0,0,0 (overfilled sides); row 10 has 1,1,0 vs expected 1,1,0 (matches but later mismatches); row 12 all 1s vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (minor); row 13 has 7,0,0 vs expected 7,7,7,7 (underfilled); overall, code detects some vertical fills but misses horizontal enclosures and overfills bays.
 * Training example 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 3 position 6 with 7 (isolated? but expected 0); row 4 has 1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1 (overfilled); row 7 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7 (mismatch in positions 11-12: 7,0 vs 0,7—shifted fill); row 8 similar shift; row 9 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1 (underfilled position 6); bottom rows match expected fills, suggesting vertical patterns work better than horizontal.
 * No object extraction function present, which might help identify connected 1-components for global enclosure detection instead of local 0-cell checks.
 * The 2-neighbor logic only handles specific L-shapes but misses straight or opposite pairs, leading to underfilling in linear opens (e.g., training 2 row 13 underfill).
 * Single pass mutation causes order-dependent errors, like early fills affecting later num_1 counts (unknown if this caused specific mismatches, but likely in complex shapes).
 * No reversal or iterative passes, so partial fills don't propagate (e.g., training 1 row 12 underfill).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in ways that suggest partial enclosure detection (e.g., vertical fills in columns 4-5 rows 2-12 look like bay handling, horizontal in row 4-5), but it does not look fully correct—many areas seem underfilled or overfilled compared to likely expected (based on training patterns), such as row 5 having 7,7,7,1,... which might overfill an open area, and row 9-10 having scattered 7s in a dense 1 block that expected might keep more as 1s for unprocessed shapes.
 * Missing fills in bottom-left enclosure (rows 10-12, columns 5-7 should likely have more 7s for interior if it's a bay, but has 7,0,7—underfilled like training 3).
 * Overfills in row 2 position 4 with 7 where it might be open (similar to training 2 overfill); right-side 7s in rows 2-10 column 10 seem correct for a separate shape, but without expected, hard to confirm—however, inconsistencies with training suggest it's not handling mixed horizontal/vertical opens well.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates the same flaws as trainings (local over/under-fills), so it likely doesn't match expected; needs better global shape detection to avoid local errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:39:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid of 0s (empty space) and 1s (solid elements, like walls or blobs), where the goal is to process the grid to identify and mark boundaries of enclosed holes, isolated elements, and various "bay" structures (indentations or openings in the 1s) by changing specific boundary 1s to 7s (indicating marked boundaries), while sometimes setting certain 1s to 0s or skipping markings to avoid over-processing nested or adjacent features. The processing must preserve the overall structure but highlight enclosures and bays without marking open or irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero adjacent 1s in 4 directions) by setting them to 0, as they are not part of any meaningful structure.
 * For enclosed holes (0s fully surrounded by 1s in all 4 directions), mark the 8 surrounding 1s (orthogonal and diagonal) as 7s to highlight the boundary, but only if it's a true enclosure—avoid marking if it's part of a larger open area.
 * Handle "double horizontal bays": Pairs of adjacent 0s in the same row, each with exactly 3 adjacent 1s (indicating a narrow horizontal indentation); mark the side walls (left of first 0, right of second 0) in both the bay row and the row below as 7s, and set any 1s in the centers of the row below to 0s to "fill" or open the bay—include a skip (c +=1) to avoid double-processing overlapping bays.
 * For L-bays (0s with exactly 2 orthogonal adjacent 1s that are not opposites, forming an L-shape), mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal 1 between them as 7s, but skip if the two 1s are opposite (straight line, not L).
 * For single bays (0s with exactly 3 orthogonal adjacent 1s, indicating one open direction), mark the 3 closed orthogonal 1s as 7s and the 2 diagonals on the closed side as 7s; include a skip condition if the open-side adjacent cell is a 0 with 3 adjacent 1s (to avoid marking nested bays); add extra filling for vertical opens by marking 3 horizontal cells in the open direction as 7s if that cell is 0.
 * Process in sequence: isolated removal first, then enclosed holes, then double bays, L-bays, single bays—order matters to avoid interfering with prior markings (e.g., don't mark a bay if it's already resolved as an enclosure).
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals are crucial for enclosures and bays but not for adjacency counts (use 4-dir for neighbors, 8-dir for boundaries); avoid over-marking adjacent structures (e.g., shared walls between bays should not all be marked if it breaks the shape); handle edges/boundaries carefully (check bounds); nested or adjacent bays require skips to prevent cascading errors; vertical/horizontal symmetry isn't assumed, so check all orientations; 7s should only replace 1s, never create new 1s or change 0s to 7s directly.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided), considerations include avoiding double-counting in loops (e.g., c +=1 in double bays), distinguishing L from straight openings, and conditional skips for nested features— but execution often over-marks or under-marks due to incomplete pattern matching.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 17x17 for train 1, 16x16 for test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions form a modular pipeline, which is helpful for isolating rules, but several have bugs or incompletenesses (detailed below). No custom types are defined, but grid is consistently List[List[int]].

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Helpful for initial cleanup: counts 4-dir adjacent 1s and sets isolated to 0.
    # Works well in isolation but should run only once at start to avoid re-isolating marked 7s (treat 7 as 1? Current code checks ==1, so 7s are preserved).
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and out[i + di][j + dj] == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```

```python
def handle_enclosed_holes(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Helpful for fully enclosed 0s: checks 4-dir for enclosure, then marks up to 8 neighbors (3x3 excluding center) as 7 if they are 1.
    # Subtle bug: It iterates over all 0s and marks neighbors, but uses new_g for output while checking g—good for non-overlap, but may miss if multiple holes share walls.
    # In train 3, it correctly marks some but over-marks extras (e.g., row 4 position 4 as 7 unexpectedly).
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == 0:
                num1 = 0
                for dr, dc in dirs4:
                    nr = r + dr

No extraction functions provided (e.g., no def extract_objects), but the modular rule functions act as such—useful for debugging individual rules.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, but it fails all trainings due to over-marking boundaries (e.g., marking 1s as 7s where they should remain 1s or become 0s) and missing skips for nested structures.
 * Missed handling vertical double bays (only horizontal implemented, causing asymmetry in train 2 row 12-14 where expected has vertical 7s but generated has horizontals).
 * Over-marked in train 1: row 11 has 7,7,7,7 but expected 7,0,0,7 (likely from double bay not setting centers to 0 correctly or L/single interfering); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7 but expected all 1s (enclosed hole or bay overreach); row 14 has 7 at col 8 but expected 0 (isolated marking error).
 * Train 2 mismatches: row 2 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (L-bay falsely triggered); row 5 has 1,7,7,0 but expected 1,1,0,... (single bay over-marks); row 12 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (double bay misses vertical); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7 but expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7 (under-marks vertical bay).
 * Train 3 mismatches: row 3 has 7 at col 6 but expected 0 (enclosed hole falsely marks non-boundary); row 4 has 1,7,7,7,1 but expected 1,1,1,1,1 (single/L bay over-marks open area).
 * Function handle_double_horizontal_bays is partially helpful but broken for vertical cases and over-sets 0s incorrectly in some nestings (don't rely solely, extend to vertical).
 * Function handle_L_bays is unhelpful or incorrect for non-horizontal Ls and triggers falsely on near-opposites (avoid until rotations added).
 * Function handle_single_bays is essential but broken—skip condition insufficient for all nestings, extra fill only vertical (causes most errors in trains); fix diagonals and add horizontal fills.
 * handle_enclosed_holes is mostly helpful but over-marks shared walls in complex blobs (e.g., train 3 row 4).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and likely correct (no obvious errors), but run early.
 * Overall, pipeline order is good, but functions interfere (e.g., bays after holes mark already-resolved areas).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many 1s as 7s in ways that don't align with training expectations, creating irregular boundaries (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 4 and 7,7,7 at cols 10-12, but looks like an open area that should remain 1s; row 5 has scattered 7s/0s in a blob that expected might keep more 1s per train patterns; row 11 has 7s in row 11 col 4-5 but then 0 at col 6 where it might be a bay center needing 0 but sides not marked right; row 12 has 7,7,0 at cols 4-6, suggesting incomplete double bay handling).
 * Compared to trainings, it misses subtle nestings (e.g., potential vertical bays in cols 6-8 not fully marked/skipped, leading to extra 7s in row 7 col 3=0 but surrounded by 7s); over-marks diagonals inappropriately (e.g., row 8 col 12=0 but adjacent 1s marked 7 where expected might be open).
 * Does not make sense for a cohesive enclosure/bay marking—too many isolated 7s (e.g., row 3 col 13=1 unmarked but should be 7 if bay), and the bottom (rows 12-15) has abrupt 7,0,0 patterns like unresolved double bays; to handle test, need better vertical bay detection and stricter skips, as test seems to have more vertical/nested features than horizontal trainings.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:39:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled cells) through morphological-like operations: removing "thin protrusions" (isolated or barely connected 1s), removing fully isolated 1s, and then highlighting (coloring to 7) any remaining 1s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to small connected components of 0s (size 1 or 2, using 4-connectivity for zeros but 8-connectivity for adjacency checks). The goal is likely to clean up noise in a visual pattern or identify boundaries/features around small holes or gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are rectangular lists of lists with consistent dimensions; assume 0s are background/empty, 1s are foreground/object pixels.
 * Connectivity for zero components uses 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for BFS/flood fill to find small enclosed or open spaces (size <=2).
 * Adjacency for coloring uses 8 directions (including diagonals) to mark 1s touching these small zero components, but only after prior cleaning steps.
 * Cleaning happens sequentially: first remove thin protrusions (1s with >=3 zero neighbors in 4 directions, indicating tips or spurs), then remove isolated 1s (those with 0 one-neighbors in 4 directions).
 * Subtlety: Cleaning modifies a copy of the grid, but coloring uses the original grid for zero detection (to preserve original small holes) while applying to the cleaned grid.
 * Potential misses: Over-removal if protrusions are checked simultaneously without iteration (single pass may leave remnants); small zero components might be open edges, not just enclosed holes; no handling for larger zero components (they shouldn't trigger coloring); diagonal adjacency is key for "touching" but not for zero connectivity.
 * Edge cases: Border cells have fewer neighbors; multiple small zero components per grid; after cleaning, some 1s might become isolated but aren't re-checked; output should preserve 0s and change only specific 1s to 7 (no other values).
 * General: Single-pass operations avoid infinite loops; use BFS for exact component sizing/collection; visited arrays prevent re-processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a sequential pipeline (protrusions -> isolated -> coloring), which aligns with cleaning before highlighting, but fails entirely due to a syntax error in color_adjacent_to_small_zeros (incomplete if-block after first BFS attempt, line 61).
 * remove_thin_protrusions and remove_isolated are syntactically correct and likely work for their parts (single-pass neighbor counting in 4 directions), but untested due to overall error.
 * color_adjacent_to_small_zeros correctly identifies the need for BFS on original g for zeros, collection of small components (<=2), and 8-dir adjacency coloring on cleaned grid, but the code is broken (first BFS lacks body/indentation, leading to execution error; second BFS is good but orphaned).
 * No outputs generated for any example, so nothing "worked" in terms of producing grids; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) resulted in identical ERROR messages.
 * The main_program orchestrates steps correctly (temp_g for cleaning, result for coloring), but inherits the syntax issue.
 * No extraction of objects or other helper functions attempted; focus is purely on grid modifications.
 * Subtle issue: Single-pass cleaning might not handle chained dependencies (e.g., removing a protrusion could isolate another 1), but not addressed here.
 * Train examples 1-3 and test all failed identically (no grids output), differing from expected by not executing at all—expected would be modified grids with 0/1/7 values highlighting small-zero-adjacent areas after cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (syntax failure), so it does not make sense or look correct—it produced no grid at all, just a traceback about indentation after an if-statement.
 * Without execution, it can't match any expected cleaned/highlighted grid; for instance, if the test input has thin 1s, isolated points, or small zero gaps, the output should show removals (to 0) and colorings (to 7), but nothing was generated to compare.
 * This indicates the program can't handle the test input (or any input) due to the bug, missing all puzzle effects like protrusion removal or small-zero highlighting.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid of 0s (empty space) and 1s (solid elements, like walls or blobs), where the goal is to process the grid to identify and mark boundaries of enclosed holes, isolated elements, and various "bay" structures (indentations or openings in the 1s) by changing specific boundary 1s to 7s (indicating marked boundaries), while sometimes setting certain 1s to 0s or skipping markings to avoid over-processing nested or adjacent features. The processing must preserve the overall structure but highlight enclosures and bays without marking open or irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero adjacent 1s in 4 directions) by setting them to 0, as they are not part of any meaningful structure.
 * For enclosed holes (0s fully surrounded by 1s in all 4 directions), mark the 8 surrounding 1s (orthogonal and diagonal) as 7s to highlight the boundary, but only if it's a true enclosure—avoid marking if it's part of a larger open area.
 * Handle "double horizontal bays": Pairs of adjacent 0s in the same row, each with exactly 3 adjacent 1s (indicating a narrow horizontal indentation); mark the side walls (left of first 0, right of second 0) in both the bay row and the row below as 7s, and set any 1s in the centers of the row below to 0s to "fill" or open the bay—include a skip (c +=1) to avoid double-processing overlapping bays.
 * For L-bays (0s with exactly 2 orthogonal adjacent 1s that are not opposites, forming an L-shape), mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal 1 between them as 7s, but skip if the two 1s are opposite (straight line, not L).
 * For single bays (0s with exactly 3 orthogonal adjacent 1s, indicating one open direction), mark the 3 closed orthogonal 1s as 7s and the 2 diagonals on the closed side as 7s; include a skip condition if the open-side adjacent cell is a 0 with 3 adjacent 1s (to avoid marking nested bays); add extra filling for vertical opens by marking 3 horizontal cells in the open direction as 7s if that cell is 0.
 * Process in sequence: isolated removal first, then enclosed holes, then double bays, L-bays, single bays—order matters to avoid interfering with prior markings (e.g., don't mark a bay if it's already resolved as an enclosure).
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals are crucial for enclosures and bays but not for adjacency counts (use 4-dir for neighbors, 8-dir for boundaries); avoid over-marking adjacent structures (e.g., shared walls between bays should not all be marked if it breaks the shape); handle edges/boundaries carefully (check bounds); nested or adjacent bays require skips to prevent cascading errors; vertical/horizontal symmetry isn't assumed, so check all orientations; 7s should only replace 1s, never create new 1s or change 0s to 7s directly.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided), considerations include avoiding double-counting in loops (e.g., c +=1 in double bays), distinguishing L from straight openings, and conditional skips for nested features— but execution often over-marks or under-marks due to incomplete pattern matching.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 17x17 for train 1, 16x16 for test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic.

No extraction functions provided (e.g., no def extract_objects), but the modular rule functions act as such—useful for debugging individual rules.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, but it fails all trainings due to over-marking boundaries (e.g., marking 1s as 7s where they should remain 1s or become 0s) and missing skips for nested structures.
 * Missed handling vertical double bays (only horizontal implemented, causing asymmetry in train 2 row 12-14 where expected has vertical 7s but generated has horizontals).
 * Over-marked in train 1: row 11 has 7,7,7,7 but expected 7,0,0,7 (likely from double bay not setting centers to 0 correctly or L/single interfering); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7 but expected all 1s (enclosed hole or bay overreach); row 14 has 7 at col 8 but expected 0 (isolated marking error).
 * Train 2 mismatches: row 2 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (L-bay falsely triggered); row 5 has 1,7,7,0 but expected 1,1,0,... (single bay over-marks); row 12 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (double bay misses vertical); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7 but expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7 (under-marks vertical bay).
 * Train 3 mismatches: row 3 has 7 at col 6 but expected 0 (enclosed hole falsely marks non-boundary); row 4 has 1,7,7,7,1 but expected 1,1,1,1,1 (single/L bay over-marks open area).
 * Function handle_double_horizontal_bays is partially helpful but broken for vertical cases and over-sets 0s incorrectly in some nestings (don't rely solely, extend to vertical).
 * Function handle_L_bays is unhelpful or incorrect for non-horizontal Ls and triggers falsely on near-opposites (avoid until rotations added).
 * Function handle_single_bays is essential but broken—skip condition insufficient for all nestings, extra fill only vertical (causes most errors in trains); fix diagonals and add horizontal fills.
 * handle_enclosed_holes is mostly helpful but over-marks shared walls in complex blobs (e.g., train 3 row 4).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and likely correct (no obvious errors), but run early.
 * Overall, pipeline order is good, but functions interfere (e.g., bays after holes mark already-resolved areas).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many 1s as 7s in ways that don't align with training expectations, creating irregular boundaries (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 4 and 7,7,7 at cols 10-12, but looks like an open area that should remain 1s; row 5 has scattered 7s/0s in a blob that expected might keep more 1s per train patterns; row 11 has 7s in row 11 col 4-5 but then 0 at col 6 where it might be a bay center needing 0 but sides not marked right; row 12 has 7,7,0 at cols 4-6, suggesting incomplete double bay handling).
 * Compared to trainings, it misses subtle nestings (e.g., potential vertical bays in cols 6-8 not fully marked/skipped, leading to extra 7s in row 7 col 3=0 but surrounded by 7s); over-marks diagonals inappropriately (e.g., row 8 col 12=0 but adjacent 1s marked 7 where expected might be open).
 * Does not make sense for a cohesive enclosure/bay marking—too many isolated 7s (e.g., row 3 col 13=1 unmarked but should be 7 if bay), and the bottom (rows 12-15) has abrupt 7,0,0 patterns like unresolved double bays; to handle test, need better vertical bay detection and stricter skips, as test seems to have more vertical/nested features than horizontal trainings.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the input to remove isolated 1s and then identify and mark specific enclosed or patterned regions by changing certain 1s to 7s, likely to highlight boundaries, fills, or shapes like loops, bays, or internal areas. The output preserves the overall structure but annotates detectable features, with 7s indicating processed or filled elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't form part of larger structures.
 * For 0 cells (empty spaces), detect surrounding 1s in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) to identify enclosures: full surround (4 neighbors) fills all eight surrounding cells with 7 if they are 1s; 3 neighbors indicate an open bay, filling closed sides and interior/exterior based on open direction, with conditions for low-adjacency cells; 2 neighbors handle corner-like or L-shaped opens by filling specific adjacent 1s.
 * Subtlety in 3-neighbor case: Interior fill is always 3 cells in the closed direction, but exterior/open-side fill only applies if the open-side cell is internal (0) and has <2 neighbors, or if already 1 (always fill); this prevents overfilling unbounded areas.
 * Subtlety in 2-neighbor case: Only specific diagonal pairs of neighbors (e.g., left+down but not up+right) trigger fills of 3-cell L-shapes, ignoring other configurations like straight lines or opposites.
 * Process in a single pass over 0 cells, using mutable out grid; order matters as changes affect later checks (top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
 * No diagonal neighbor checks for isolation or basic adjacency—only orthogonal for core logic, but eight directions for some fills.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16), with many empty rows/columns; preserve all 0s unless part of a pattern fill.
 * 7s seem to mark "claimed" or boundary/interior cells without removing them, suggesting annotation rather than erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Conditional fills in open directions only apply to low-adjacency 0s (<2 neighbors) to avoid filling unrelated empty space; also, is_internal check limits open-side fills.
 * No handling for num_1 == 1 or 0 cases explicitly beyond isolation removal.
 * Potential overreach: Code modifies 1s to 7s even if not enclosed, based on local 0-cell views, which can propagate incorrectly in complex shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_neighbor(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, di: int, dj: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    ni = i + di
    nj = j + dj
    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
        return g[ni][nj]
    return 0
```
(This is useful for safe boundary-checked neighbor access, used in isolation and pattern detection.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if get_neighbor(out, i, j, di, dj) == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This correctly removes isolated 1s based on orthogonal neighbors and is likely working well, as no differences noted in isolations across examples.)

The handle_patterns function is partially helpful for enclosure detection but broken in specifics (see below); no extraction of full objects/shapes yet, which might be needed for global context like connected components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements isolated 1 removal, which works as no isolated 1s appear in generated outputs where they shouldn't.
 * Pattern handling partially works for some full enclosures (num_1==4), as seen in training 1 where top-left and bottom shapes have some 7 fills matching expected, but fails on partial opens (num_1==3/2), leading to under/over-filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated has extra 1s in row 11 (positions 5-6 should be 7 and 0 per expected, but are 0 and 0—underfilled); row 12 has 7,1,1 instead of 7,7,7 (underfilled interior); row 13 all 1s except expected has 7s in positions 4-7 (missed horizontal fill); row 14 has extra 7s in positions 7-8 (overfilled where expected is all 1s); bottom shape in rows 16-17 matches expected fills.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrectly fills row 2 with 1s where expected has 1s but misses some 7s (e.g., positions 1-2 should be 1s but code put 7s? Wait, row 2 is [1,7,7,1,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,...]—overfilled early); row 5 has 7,7,0 vs expected 0,0,0 (overfilled sides); row 10 has 1,1,0 vs expected 1,1,0 (matches but later mismatches); row 12 all 1s vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (minor); row 13 has 7,0,0 vs expected 7,7,7,7 (underfilled); overall, code detects some vertical fills but misses horizontal enclosures and overfills bays.
 * Training example 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 3 position 6 with 7 (isolated? but expected 0); row 4 has 1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1 (overfilled); row 7 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7 (mismatch in positions 11-12: 7,0 vs 0,7—shifted fill); row 8 similar shift; row 9 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1 (underfilled position 6); bottom rows match expected fills, suggesting vertical patterns work better than horizontal.
 * No object extraction function present, which might help identify connected 1-components for global enclosure detection instead of local 0-cell checks.
 * The 2-neighbor logic only handles specific L-shapes but misses straight or opposite pairs, leading to underfilling in linear opens (e.g., training 2 row 13 underfill).
 * Single pass mutation causes order-dependent errors, like early fills affecting later num_1 counts (unknown if this caused specific mismatches, but likely in complex shapes).
 * No reversal or iterative passes, so partial fills don't propagate (e.g., training 1 row 12 underfill).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in ways that suggest partial enclosure detection (e.g., vertical fills in columns 4-5 rows 2-12 look like bay handling, horizontal in row 4-5), but it does not look fully correct—many areas seem underfilled or overfilled compared to likely expected (based on training patterns), such as row 5 having 7,7,7,1,... which might overfill an open area, and row 9-10 having scattered 7s in a dense 1 block that expected might keep more as 1s for unprocessed shapes.
 * Missing fills in bottom-left enclosure (rows 10-12, columns 5-7 should likely have more 7s for interior if it's a bay, but has 7,0,7—underfilled like training 3).
 * Overfills in row 2 position 4 with 7 where it might be open (similar to training 2 overfill); right-side 7s in rows 2-10 column 10 seem correct for a separate shape, but without expected, hard to confirm—however, inconsistencies with training suggest it's not handling mixed horizontal/vertical opens well.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates the same flaws as trainings (local over/under-fills), so it likely doesn't match expected; needs better global shape detection to avoid local errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:44:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid where 1s represent land or solid structures and 0s represent empty space or water, and the goal is to "clean" the grid by removing invalid or protruding land pixels while identifying and marking enclosed bays, holes, or inland features (surrounded by 3+ sides of land) with 7s to highlight them, preserving borders and certain connected structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has borders that must be preserved (1s on edges shouldn't be removed), and cleaning only applies to internal (non-border) 1s with <=1 neighbor or 2 non-opposite neighbors (e.g., not straight lines like up-down [dirs 0,1] or left-right [2,3]).
 * Bays/holes are 0s surrounded by >=3 land neighbors (using 4-directional for enclosure check, but 8-directional for marking adjacent 1s); for exactly 3 neighbors, detect the single open direction and conditionally fill/mark 1s in that direction if the open cell has <2 land neighbors (simple bay) or handle "double" cases by marking center and far-side extensions.
 * Subtle elements: For 3-neighbor 0s, the open direction must lead to a truly open 0 (not land), and filling is 3-wide strips perpendicular to the direction (e.g., horizontal strip for vertical open); for open_num1==2, mark vertically/horizontally extended far sides (2 steps away, 3-wide). Avoid over-marking—only mark 1s adjacent to the hole/bay. Holes can be multi-cell (e.g., L-shapes or larger enclosures need full filling). Process in passes if needed, but current code does single pass. Border 1s are immune to cleaning/marking changes. Grids can have disconnected components or vertical/horizontal symmetries that require direction-specific logic. Miss easy cases like single-pixel protrusions or diagonal bays. Expected outputs show 7s only on former 1s that form bay walls, not on 0s; 0s remain 0 unless part of a fill (but code marks 1s to 7, not 0s).
 * Considerations across attempts: Direction indexing (dirs4: 0=up,1=down,2=left,3=right) is crucial for opposite checks and filling strips. Use 8-dirs for broad neighbor marking but 4-dirs for enclosure count. Handle vertical vs. horizontal opens separately for far-side marking. Code assumes rectangular grids; no rotation or non-1/0 values. Iterative cleaning/marking may be needed for nested bays, but examples suggest single pass suffices if logic is right. Preserve all original 0s and non-marked 1s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_num_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This 4-dir neighbor count is essential for enclosure detection and cleaning rules.)

```python
def clean_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if new_g[r][c] == 1 and not (r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1):
                one_dirs = []
                for i, (dr, dc) in enumerate(dirs4):
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and new_g[nr][nc] == 1:
                        one_dirs.append(i)
                num1 = len(one_dirs)
                if num1 <= 1 or (num1 == 2 and sorted(one_dirs) not in [[0, 1], [2, 3]]):
                    new_g[r][c] = 0
    return new_g
```
(This partially works for removing invalid internal 1s but may over-remove in complex shapes; useful as a preprocessing step.)

(The `handle_bays_and_holes` function is an attempt at marking but is broken—see below; no extraction functions were provided, but one could be added to identify connected components of 0s for better hole detection, e.g., flood-fill to find enclosed areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt's clean_grid works partially (correctly removes some protrusions in train 1 rows 4-5 and train 2 cols 2-13, preserving borders and straight lines) but fails to remove nothing in train 3 (leading to near-empty output) and over-removes or misses in bays (e.g., train 1 row 3 keeps 1s at cols 7-9 that should stay but get marked later).
 * handle_bays_and_holes correctly identifies some 3+ neighbor 0s and marks adjacent 1s to 7 (e.g., train 1 top bay at row0 col2, row1 cols2-4; train 2 bottom at row13 cols5-8) but misses nested/complex fills: in train 1, fails to mark row3 cols7-9 to 7, row4 cols7-10 to 7/0/7, row5 cols7-9 to 7, and entire lower structure (rows9-13 cols5-7); also incorrectly marks row1 col15-16 as 7s (should be 1s) and leaves row16 col16 as 0 (should be 7? wait, expected has 7 there but generated doesn't).
 * In train 2, misses filling inner land-like structure (rows5-9 cols6-11 should be partial 1s turning to 7s, but generated leaves as 0s or partial 7s only at edges like row5 col13-15); incorrectly marks row0 col15 as 0 (expected 7) and row8 col15 as 0 (expected 7), and row9 col15 as 7 but adjacent wrong.
 * Train 3 is a total failure: generated almost all 0s (only row4 col15=1), missing the entire vertical structure (rows4-13 cols4-15 with 7s in bays like row5 col9-11, row6 col11, etc.); likely because cleaning removes the thin structure incorrectly or hole detection skips due to border proximity/openness.
 * No object extraction function was attempted, which would help identify connected 0-components for true enclosures (e.g., flood-fill from borders to distinguish inland holes); current neighbor-based detection misses multi-cell bays.
 * The 3-neighbor open direction logic works for simple cases (e.g., train 1 top) but breaks on open_num1==2 (far-side marking doesn't trigger properly, e.g., train 2 inner) and doesn't handle len(open_dirs)>1 or diagonal opens.
 * Single-pass processing misses iterative needs, like marking one bay exposing another.
 * Function `handle_bays_and_holes` is broken for complex/nested cases and over-marks borders (don't use as-is; needs refinement for open_dir filling strips and far-side logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially captures cleaning (removes protrusions in rows0-2 cols5-15 and row11-15 cols5-15 correctly as 0s) and some bay marking (e.g., row7 cols11-13=7s for a small enclosure, row8-10 cols10-12=7/0/7 pattern), but it does not look fully correct: misses marking larger bays like row5 col5-6 should lead to filling row6 col4? (hard to tell without expected, but based on patterns, likely needs 7s around row6-7 cols3-5 enclosure and row4 col13-15); incorrectly leaves row7 col15=0 (probably should be 1 or 7 if bay wall) and row9 col13=7 but adjacent row8 col13=1 (inconsistent with expected bay fills); the bottom structure row15 col15=1 is preserved but may need 7s if it's a bay wall. Overall, it under-marks enclosures (e.g., the L-shape at rows6-10 cols3-13 likely needs more 7s in the inner corner) and fails to handle the test's vertical thin connections similar to train 3's failure. This suggests the code detects simple 3-sided bays but misses multi-cell or directionally complex ones, making the output incomplete.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:44:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled cells) through morphological-like operations: removing "thin protrusions" (isolated or barely connected 1s), removing fully isolated 1s, and then highlighting (coloring to 7) any remaining 1s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to small connected components of 0s (size 1 or 2, using 4-connectivity for zeros but 8-connectivity for adjacency checks). The goal is likely to clean up noise in a visual pattern or identify boundaries/features around small holes or gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are rectangular lists of lists with consistent dimensions; assume 0s are background/empty, 1s are foreground/object pixels.
 * Connectivity for zero components uses 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for BFS/flood fill to find small enclosed or open spaces (size <=2).
 * Adjacency for coloring uses 8 directions (including diagonals) to mark 1s touching these small zero components, but only after prior cleaning steps.
 * Cleaning happens sequentially: first remove thin protrusions (1s with >=3 zero neighbors in 4 directions, indicating tips or spurs), then remove isolated 1s (those with 0 one-neighbors in 4 directions).
 * Subtlety: Cleaning modifies a copy of the grid, but coloring uses the original grid for zero detection (to preserve original small holes) while applying to the cleaned grid.
 * Potential misses: Over-removal if protrusions are checked simultaneously without iteration (single pass may leave remnants); small zero components might be open edges, not just enclosed holes; no handling for larger zero components (they shouldn't trigger coloring); diagonal adjacency is key for "touching" but not for zero connectivity.
 * Edge cases: Border cells have fewer neighbors; multiple small zero components per grid; after cleaning, some 1s might become isolated but aren't re-checked; output should preserve 0s and change only specific 1s to 7 (no other values).
 * General: Single-pass operations avoid infinite loops; use BFS for exact component sizing/collection; visited arrays prevent re-processing.

    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a sequential pipeline (protrusions -> isolated -> coloring), which aligns with cleaning before highlighting, but fails entirely due to a syntax error in color_adjacent_to_small_zeros (incomplete if-block after first BFS attempt, line 61).
 * remove_thin_protrusions and remove_isolated are syntactically correct and likely work for their parts (single-pass neighbor counting in 4 directions), but untested due to overall error.
 * color_adjacent_to_small_zeros correctly identifies the need for BFS on original g for zeros, collection of small components (<=2), and 8-dir adjacency coloring on cleaned grid, but the code is broken (first BFS lacks body/indentation, leading to execution error; second BFS is good but orphaned).
 * No outputs generated for any example, so nothing "worked" in terms of producing grids; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) resulted in identical ERROR messages.
 * The main_program orchestrates steps correctly (temp_g for cleaning, result for coloring), but inherits the syntax issue.
 * No extraction of objects or other helper functions attempted; focus is purely on grid modifications.
 * Subtle issue: Single-pass cleaning might not handle chained dependencies (e.g., removing a protrusion could isolate another 1), but not addressed here.
 * Train examples 1-3 and test all failed identically (no grids output), differing from expected by not executing at all—expected would be modified grids with 0/1/7 values highlighting small-zero-adjacent areas after cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (syntax failure), so it does not make sense or look correct—it produced no grid at all, just a traceback about indentation after an if-statement.
 * Without execution, it can't match any expected cleaned/highlighted grid; for instance, if the test input has thin 1s, isolated points, or small zero gaps, the output should show removals (to 0) and colorings (to 7), but nothing was generated to compare.
 * This indicates the program can't handle the test input (or any input) due to the bug, missing all puzzle effects like protrusion removal or small-zero highlighting.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid of 0s (empty space) and 1s (solid elements, like walls or blobs), where the goal is to process the grid to identify and mark boundaries of enclosed holes, isolated elements, and various "bay" structures (indentations or openings in the 1s) by changing specific boundary 1s to 7s (indicating marked boundaries), while sometimes setting certain 1s to 0s or skipping markings to avoid over-processing nested or adjacent features. The processing must preserve the overall structure but highlight enclosures and bays without marking open or irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero adjacent 1s in 4 directions) by setting them to 0, as they are not part of any meaningful structure.
 * For enclosed holes (0s fully surrounded by 1s in all 4 directions), mark the 8 surrounding 1s (orthogonal and diagonal) as 7s to highlight the boundary, but only if it's a true enclosure—avoid marking if it's part of a larger open area.
 * Handle "double horizontal bays": Pairs of adjacent 0s in the same row, each with exactly 3 adjacent 1s (indicating a narrow horizontal indentation); mark the side walls (left of first 0, right of second 0) in both the bay row and the row below as 7s, and set any 1s in the centers of the row below to 0s to "fill" or open the bay—include a skip (c +=1) to avoid double-processing overlapping bays.
 * For L-bays (0s with exactly 2 orthogonal adjacent 1s that are not opposites, forming an L-shape), mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal 1 between them as 7s, but skip if the two 1s are opposite (straight line, not L).
 * For single bays (0s with exactly 3 orthogonal adjacent 1s, indicating one open direction), mark the 3 closed orthogonal 1s as 7s and the 2 diagonals on the closed side as 7s; include a skip condition if the open-side adjacent cell is a 0 with 3 adjacent 1s (to avoid marking nested bays); add extra filling for vertical opens by marking 3 horizontal cells in the open direction as 7s if that cell is 0.
 * Process in sequence: isolated removal first, then enclosed holes, then double bays, L-bays, single bays—order matters to avoid interfering with prior markings (e.g., don't mark a bay if it's already resolved as an enclosure).
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals are crucial for enclosures and bays but not for adjacency counts (use 4-dir for neighbors, 8-dir for boundaries); avoid over-marking adjacent structures (e.g., shared walls between bays should not all be marked if it breaks the shape); handle edges/boundaries carefully (check bounds); nested or adjacent bays require skips to prevent cascading errors; vertical/horizontal symmetry isn't assumed, so check all orientations; 7s should only replace 1s, never create new 1s or change 0s to 7s directly.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided), considerations include avoiding double-counting in loops (e.g., c +=1 in double bays), distinguishing L from straight openings, and conditional skips for nested features— but execution often over-marks or under-marks due to incomplete pattern matching.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 17x17 for train 1, 16x16 for test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions form a modular pipeline, which is helpful for isolating rules, but several have bugs or incompletenesses (detailed below). No custom types are defined, but grid is consistently List[List[int]].

No extraction functions provided (e.g., no def extract_objects), but the modular rule functions act as such—useful for debugging individual rules.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, but it fails all trainings due to over-marking boundaries (e.g., marking 1s as 7s where they should remain 1s or become 0s) and missing skips for nested structures.
 * Missed handling vertical double bays (only horizontal implemented, causing asymmetry in train 2 row 12-14 where expected has vertical 7s but generated has horizontals).
 * Over-marked in train 1: row 11 has 7,7,7,7 but expected 7,0,0,7 (likely from double bay not setting centers to 0 correctly or L/single interfering); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7 but expected all 1s (enclosed hole or bay overreach); row 14 has 7 at col 8 but expected 0 (isolated marking error).
 * Train 2 mismatches: row 2 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (L-bay falsely triggered); row 5 has 1,7,7,0 but expected 1,1,0,... (single bay over-marks); row 12 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (double bay misses vertical); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7 but expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7 (under-marks vertical bay).
 * Train 3 mismatches: row 3 has 7 at col 6 but expected 0 (enclosed hole falsely marks non-boundary); row 4 has 1,7,7,7,1 but expected 1,1,1,1,1 (single/L bay over-marks open area).
 * Function handle_double_horizontal_bays is partially helpful but broken for vertical cases and over-sets 0s incorrectly in some nestings (don't rely solely, extend to vertical).
 * Function handle_L_bays is unhelpful or incorrect for non-horizontal Ls and triggers falsely on near-opposites (avoid until rotations added).
 * Function handle_single_bays is essential but broken—skip condition insufficient for all nestings, extra fill only vertical (causes most errors in trains); fix diagonals and add horizontal fills.
 * handle_enclosed_holes is mostly helpful but over-marks shared walls in complex blobs (e.g., train 3 row 4).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and likely correct (no obvious errors), but run early.
 * Overall, pipeline order is good, but functions interfere (e.g., bays after holes mark already-resolved areas).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many 1s as 7s in ways that don't align with training expectations, creating irregular boundaries (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 4 and 7,7,7 at cols 10-12, but looks like an open area that should remain 1s; row 5 has scattered 7s/0s in a blob that expected might keep more 1s per train patterns; row 11 has 7s in row 11 col 4-5 but then 0 at col 6 where it might be a bay center needing 0 but sides not marked right; row 12 has 7,7,0 at cols 4-6, suggesting incomplete double bay handling).
 * Compared to trainings, it misses subtle nestings (e.g., potential vertical bays in cols 6-8 not fully marked/skipped, leading to extra 7s in row 7 col 3=0 but surrounded by 7s); over-marks diagonals inappropriately (e.g., row 8 col 12=0 but adjacent 1s marked 7 where expected might be open).
 * Does not make sense for a cohesive enclosure/bay marking—too many isolated 7s (e.g., row 3 col 13=1 unmarked but should be 7 if bay), and the bottom (rows 12-15) has abrupt 7,0,0 patterns like unresolved double bays; to handle test, need better vertical bay detection and stricter skips, as test seems to have more vertical/nested features than horizontal trainings.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the input to remove isolated 1s and then identify and mark specific enclosed or patterned regions by changing certain 1s to 7s, likely to highlight boundaries, fills, or shapes like loops, bays, or internal areas. The output preserves the overall structure but annotates detectable features, with 7s indicating processed or filled elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't form part of larger structures.
 * For 0 cells (empty spaces), detect surrounding 1s in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) to identify enclosures: full surround (4 neighbors) fills all eight surrounding cells with 7 if they are 1s; 3 neighbors indicate an open bay, filling closed sides and interior/exterior based on open direction, with conditions for low-adjacency cells; 2 neighbors handle corner-like or L-shaped opens by filling specific adjacent 1s.
 * Subtlety in 3-neighbor case: Interior fill is always 3 cells in the closed direction, but exterior/open-side fill only applies if the open-side cell is internal (0) and has <2 neighbors, or if already 1 (always fill); this prevents overfilling unbounded areas.
 * Subtlety in 2-neighbor case: Only specific diagonal pairs of neighbors (e.g., left+down but not up+right) trigger fills of 3-cell L-shapes, ignoring other configurations like straight lines or opposites.
 * Process in a single pass over 0 cells, using mutable out grid; order matters as changes affect later checks (top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
 * No diagonal neighbor checks for isolation or basic adjacency—only orthogonal for core logic, but eight directions for some fills.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16), with many empty rows/columns; preserve all 0s unless part of a pattern fill.
 * 7s seem to mark "claimed" or boundary/interior cells without removing them, suggesting annotation rather than erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Conditional fills in open directions only apply to low-adjacency 0s (<2 neighbors) to avoid filling unrelated empty space; also, is_internal check limits open-side fills.
 * No handling for num_1 == 1 or 0 cases explicitly beyond isolation removal.
 * Potential overreach: Code modifies 1s to 7s even if not enclosed, based on local 0-cell views, which can propagate incorrectly in complex shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_neighbor(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, di: int, dj: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    ni = i + di
    nj = j + dj
    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
        return g[ni][nj]
    return 0
```
(This is useful for safe boundary-checked neighbor access, used in isolation and pattern detection.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if get_neighbor(out, i, j, di, dj) == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This correctly removes isolated 1s based on orthogonal neighbors and is likely working well, as no differences noted in isolations across examples.)

The handle_patterns function is partially helpful for enclosure detection but broken in specifics (see below); no extraction of full objects/shapes yet, which might be needed for global context like connected components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements isolated 1 removal, which works as no isolated 1s appear in generated outputs where they shouldn't.
 * Pattern handling partially works for some full enclosures (num_1==4), as seen in training 1 where top-left and bottom shapes have some 7 fills matching expected, but fails on partial opens (num_1==3/2), leading to under/over-filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated has extra 1s in row 11 (positions 5-6 should be 7 and 0 per expected, but are 0 and 0—underfilled); row 12 has 7,1,1 instead of 7,7,7 (underfilled interior); row 13 all 1s except expected has 7s in positions 4-7 (missed horizontal fill); row 14 has extra 7s in positions 7-8 (overfilled where expected is all 1s); bottom shape in rows 16-17 matches expected fills.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrectly fills row 2 with 1s where expected has 1s but misses some 7s (e.g., positions 1-2 should be 1s but code put 7s? Wait, row 2 is [1,7,7,1,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,...]—overfilled early); row 5 has 7,7,0 vs expected 0,0,0 (overfilled sides); row 10 has 1,1,0 vs expected 1,1,0 (matches but later mismatches); row 12 all 1s vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (minor); row 13 has 7,0,0 vs expected 7,7,7,7 (underfilled); overall, code detects some vertical fills but misses horizontal enclosures and overfills bays.
 * Training example 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 3 position 6 with 7 (isolated? but expected 0); row 4 has 1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1 (overfilled); row 7 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7 (mismatch in positions 11-12: 7,0 vs 0,7—shifted fill); row 8 similar shift; row 9 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1 (underfilled position 6); bottom rows match expected fills, suggesting vertical patterns work better than horizontal.
 * No object extraction function present, which might help identify connected 1-components for global enclosure detection instead of local 0-cell checks.
 * The 2-neighbor logic only handles specific L-shapes but misses straight or opposite pairs, leading to underfilling in linear opens (e.g., training 2 row 13 underfill).
 * Single pass mutation causes order-dependent errors, like early fills affecting later num_1 counts (unknown if this caused specific mismatches, but likely in complex shapes).
 * No reversal or iterative passes, so partial fills don't propagate (e.g., training 1 row 12 underfill).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in ways that suggest partial enclosure detection (e.g., vertical fills in columns 4-5 rows 2-12 look like bay handling, horizontal in row 4-5), but it does not look fully correct—many areas seem underfilled or overfilled compared to likely expected (based on training patterns), such as row 5 having 7,7,7,1,... which might overfill an open area, and row 9-10 having scattered 7s in a dense 1 block that expected might keep more as 1s for unprocessed shapes.
 * Missing fills in bottom-left enclosure (rows 10-12, columns 5-7 should likely have more 7s for interior if it's a bay, but has 7,0,7—underfilled like training 3).
 * Overfills in row 2 position 4 with 7 where it might be open (similar to training 2 overfill); right-side 7s in rows 2-10 column 10 seem correct for a separate shape, but without expected, hard to confirm—however, inconsistencies with training suggest it's not handling mixed horizontal/vertical opens well.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates the same flaws as trainings (local over/under-fills), so it likely doesn't match expected; needs better global shape detection to avoid local errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid where 1s represent land or solid structures and 0s represent empty space or water, and the goal is to "clean" the grid by removing invalid or protruding land pixels while identifying and marking enclosed bays, holes, or inland features (surrounded by 3+ sides of land) with 7s to highlight them, preserving borders and certain connected structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has borders that must be preserved (1s on edges shouldn't be removed), and cleaning only applies to internal (non-border) 1s with <=1 neighbor or 2 non-opposite neighbors (e.g., not straight lines like up-down [dirs 0,1] or left-right [2,3]).
 * Bays/holes are 0s surrounded by >=3 land neighbors (using 4-directional for enclosure check, but 8-directional for marking adjacent 1s); for exactly 3 neighbors, detect the single open direction and conditionally fill/mark 1s in that direction if the open cell has <2 land neighbors (simple bay) or handle "double" cases by marking center and far-side extensions.
 * Subtle elements: For 3-neighbor 0s, the open direction must lead to a truly open 0 (not land), and filling is 3-wide strips perpendicular to the direction (e.g., horizontal strip for vertical open); for open_num1==2, mark vertically/horizontally extended far sides (2 steps away, 3-wide). Avoid over-marking—only mark 1s adjacent to the hole/bay. Holes can be multi-cell (e.g., L-shapes or larger enclosures need full filling). Process in passes if needed, but current code does single pass. Border 1s are immune to cleaning/marking changes. Grids can have disconnected components or vertical/horizontal symmetries that require direction-specific logic. Miss easy cases like single-pixel protrusions or diagonal bays. Expected outputs show 7s only on former 1s that form bay walls, not on 0s; 0s remain 0 unless part of a fill (but code marks 1s to 7, not 0s).
 * Considerations across attempts: Direction indexing (dirs4: 0=up,1=down,2=left,3=right) is crucial for opposite checks and filling strips. Use 8-dirs for broad neighbor marking but 4-dirs for enclosure count. Handle vertical vs. horizontal opens separately for far-side marking. Code assumes rectangular grids; no rotation or non-1/0 values. Iterative cleaning/marking may be needed for nested bays, but examples suggest single pass suffices if logic is right. Preserve all original 0s and non-marked 1s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_num_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This 4-dir neighbor count is essential for enclosure detection and cleaning rules.)

```python
def clean_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if new_g[r][c] == 1 and not (r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1):
                one_dirs = []
                for i, (dr, dc) in enumerate(dirs4):
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and new_g[nr][nc] == 1:
                        one_dirs.append(i)
                num1 = len(one_dirs)
                if num1 <= 1 or (num1 == 2 and sorted(one_dirs) not in [[0, 1], [2, 3]]):
                    new_g[r][c] = 0
    return new_g
```
(This partially works for removing invalid internal 1s but may over-remove in complex shapes; useful as a preprocessing step.)

(The `handle_bays_and_holes` function is an attempt at marking but is broken—see below; no extraction functions were provided, but one could be added to identify connected components of 0s for better hole detection, e.g., flood-fill to find enclosed areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt's clean_grid works partially (correctly removes some protrusions in train 1 rows 4-5 and train 2 cols 2-13, preserving borders and straight lines) but fails to remove nothing in train 3 (leading to near-empty output) and over-removes or misses in bays (e.g., train 1 row 3 keeps 1s at cols 7-9 that should stay but get marked later).
 * handle_bays_and_holes correctly identifies some 3+ neighbor 0s and marks adjacent 1s to 7 (e.g., train 1 top bay at row0 col2, row1 cols2-4; train 2 bottom at row13 cols5-8) but misses nested/complex fills: in train 1, fails to mark row3 cols7-9 to 7, row4 cols7-10 to 7/0/7, row5 cols7-9 to 7, and entire lower structure (rows9-13 cols5-7); also incorrectly marks row1 col15-16 as 7s (should be 1s) and leaves row16 col16 as 0 (should be 7? wait, expected has 7 there but generated doesn't).
 * In train 2, misses filling inner land-like structure (rows5-9 cols6-11 should be partial 1s turning to 7s, but generated leaves as 0s or partial 7s only at edges like row5 col13-15); incorrectly marks row0 col15 as 0 (expected 7) and row8 col15 as 0 (expected 7), and row9 col15 as 7 but adjacent wrong.
 * Train 3 is a total failure: generated almost all 0s (only row4 col15=1), missing the entire vertical structure (rows4-13 cols4-15 with 7s in bays like row5 col9-11, row6 col11, etc.); likely because cleaning removes the thin structure incorrectly or hole detection skips due to border proximity/openness.
 * No object extraction function was attempted, which would help identify connected 0-components for true enclosures (e.g., flood-fill from borders to distinguish inland holes); current neighbor-based detection misses multi-cell bays.
 * The 3-neighbor open direction logic works for simple cases (e.g., train 1 top) but breaks on open_num1==2 (far-side marking doesn't trigger properly, e.g., train 2 inner) and doesn't handle len(open_dirs)>1 or diagonal opens.
 * Single-pass processing misses iterative needs, like marking one bay exposing another.
 * Function `handle_bays_and_holes` is broken for complex/nested cases and over-marks borders (don't use as-is; needs refinement for open_dir filling strips and far-side logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially captures cleaning (removes protrusions in rows0-2 cols5-15 and row11-15 cols5-15 correctly as 0s) and some bay marking (e.g., row7 cols11-13=7s for a small enclosure, row8-10 cols10-12=7/0/7 pattern), but it does not look fully correct: misses marking larger bays like row5 col5-6 should lead to filling row6 col4? (hard to tell without expected, but based on patterns, likely needs 7s around row6-7 cols3-5 enclosure and row4 col13-15); incorrectly leaves row7 col15=0 (probably should be 1 or 7 if bay wall) and row9 col13=7 but adjacent row8 col13=1 (inconsistent with expected bay fills); the bottom structure row15 col15=1 is preserved but may need 7s if it's a bay wall. Overall, it under-marks enclosures (e.g., the L-shape at rows6-10 cols3-13 likely needs more 7s in the inner corner) and fails to handle the test's vertical thin connections similar to train 3's failure. This suggests the code detects simple 3-sided bays but misses multi-cell or directionally complex ones, making the output incomplete.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:53:20] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based shape processing, where the goal is to identify and mark (with 7) or remove (to 0) specific structural elements like thin protrusions, low-connectivity cells, or boundary configurations in binary shapes made of 1s, while preserving the core body of objects. The output grid modifies the input by highlighting removable or noise-like parts (7s) and sometimes erasing them, likely to isolate main shapes or clean up artifacts in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are composed of 1s on a 0 background; 7s seem to indicate cells targeted for removal or highlighting, often in thin arms, corners, or isolated extensions, but not the solid core.
 * Low-connectivity removal: Cells with 0 or 1 adjacent 1 (in 4 directions) should be removed early to prune isolated points or tips.
 * Thin protrusions: Cells surrounded by >=3 non-1s (edges or 0s) in 4 directions are likely noise and should be set to 0, but this must happen after initial marking to avoid over-removal.
 * Boundary scanning from 0 cells: Analyze adjacent 1s from empty spaces; configurations like single adjacent 1 (e.g., vertical chains of exactly 3 empty above a rightward protrusion) or 2-3 adjacent 1s (opposites for lines, L-shapes, or corners) trigger marking of nearby 1s to 7, but skip if the open side leads to a high-connectivity empty cell (e.g., >=2 or ==3 neighbors).
 * Directional exclusions: For horizontal/vertical lines or corners, exclude marking upward if the open side is rightward to avoid over-marking vertical extensions.
 * 8-adjacency marking: When marking from L or corner configs, use 8 directions but sometimes exclude up; this catches diagonal protrusions but risks over-marking if not conditioned on openness.
 * Second pass: After thin removal, re-scan for remaining 1s adjacent via single direction (non-up/down) and mark the adjacent 1 to 7 if it's a lingering tip.
 * Subtleties: Horizontal vs. vertical handling differs (e.g., mark 3 cells right for horizontals, down for verticals); chain lengths matter (e.g., exactly 3 empty above for specific protrusions); avoid marking solid bodies (e.g., skip if open side has >1 neighbor 1s); empty rows/columns separate objects, and processing must not bleed across them.
 * Over-removal risk: Functions like remove_low_connect can erase valid cores if applied too early; thin removal after marking helps, but mis-marking leads to chain reactions.
 * Under-marking: Complex shapes with internal 0s or diagonals may miss L/corner detections if neighbor counts aren't 8-way in some checks.
 * Grid boundaries: Always check bounds to avoid index errors, treating out-of-bounds as 0 (non-1).

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; grids are List[List[int]]. These functions are mostly helpful but need integration tweaks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a multi-pass approach (low-connect removal, config-based marking from 0s, thin protrusion removal, second marking) which partially captures boundary detection but fails on specifics like chain lengths and directional marking.
 * Worked: Basic pruning of low-connect and thin parts; 4/8-dir neighbor logic identifies some L/corners and opposites for lines; marking some protrusions to 7 in simple cases (e.g., rightward arms in Train 1).
 * Didn't work: Over-marking solid areas (e.g., in Train 1 row 5, generated sets [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] but expected keeps more 1s like [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] with differences in later rows; unknown why row 1 col 16 is 1 in generated vs 7 expected). In Train 1, row 6 has all 0s generated but expected [0s with 7s in cols 7-9]; this suggests thin removal erased marked areas prematurely or marking missed a horizontal extension.
 * Train 2: Generated marks too many 7s early (e.g., row 2 [1,7,7,7,1,...] vs expected all 1s [1,1,1,1,1,...]), over-pruning a solid top bar; row 5 has [1,7,0,0,...] but expected [1,1,0,0,...] with later 1s turned to 7s—missed shifting marking down for vertical parts; row 13 generated [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,...] but expected same with more 7s in cols 6-8, indicating under-marking of a bottom protrusion.
 * Train 3: Major failure—generated marks internal parts of a single shape (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,...] but expected [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,...] with 7s only in specific cols 9-11; row 7 [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7,0,...] vs expected similar but 7s in cols 9-11 and 13; row 13 all 0s generated vs expected [0s,7s in cols 6-8]). This shows over-marking of core (e.g., treating inner Ls as protrusions) and missing preservation of main body; thin removal likely wiped marked but connected areas.
 * Config detection bugs: Num==1 only handles rightward with exact 3-up chain, missing other singles; num==2 opposites mark inconsistently (e.g., vertical marks down 3 but not always adjacent); num==3 skips if open empty has ==3 neighbors, but may false-positive on diagonals; L-shape skip condition (both opens empty with <=1 neighbor) is too strict, leading to under-marking.
 * No object extraction function; all processing is global scan, which works for separated shapes but fails on interconnected ones without per-object isolation.
 * The second marking pass is underused—only catches single-dir tips but misses after thin removal changes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it marks excessive 7s in what seems a complex shape with arms (e.g., rows 4-9 show heavy 7-marking in cols 10-14 like [7,0,7,7,0] in row 4, but based on patterns from training, cores should preserve more 1s—e.g., expected might keep row 4 as more 1s with targeted 7s only on tips, similar to Train 1's partial matches).
 * Top rows 0-2 all 1s preserved (good, likely solid bar), but row 3 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7,0,0] marks a right protrusion to 7/0, which may be correct if thin, but row 5 [1,1,1,7,7,0,7,1,...] inserts 0s and 7s oddly—likely over-removal of a diagonal or bend, unlike expected clean marking in similar Train 3 bends.
 * Bottom rows 10-15 show under-marking (e.g., row 11 [1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] has isolated 0/7, but training suggests vertical extensions should mark down 3 consistently without gaps); row 12 all low 1s then 0s may miss a bottom arm.
 * Overall, it partially prunes but creates fragmented 7/0 patterns that don't align with training expectations of targeted tip-marking without core erosion; unclear why cols 11-12 have many 0s (perhaps thin removal over-applied post-marking), but it looks noisy rather than clean.

[2025-10-03 14:53:26] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns where one element's property (e.g., position, holes, pixels) directly influences or modifies another, without inferring broader puzzle logic or semantics. No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Connections that are not present in all trains (e.g., handling of single-pixel Blue components, which vary—sometimes preserved, sometimes absent) are excluded. If a transformation (e.g., exact pixel subtraction mechanism) cannot be directly tied to a consistent property interaction, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Blue Pixel Count → Dark Red Pixel Count (Subtractive Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The pixel count of large Blue components (those with pixels ≥29) consistently decreases in the output, with the reduction correlating to the total pixel count of overlapping or contained Dark Red components. Dark Red pixels effectively "subtract" from the host Blue's pixels.
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1: Large Blues (pixels=82, 83, 33) reduce to 67, 70, 26; Dark Reds total pixels=38 within/near them (exact subtraction unknown due to minor total pixel variance ~3).
     - Train 2: Large Blues (pixels=29, 164) reduce to 21, 139; Dark Reds total pixels=32 within/near them (exact subtraction unknown due to minor total pixel variance).
     - Train 3: Large Blue (pixels=88) reduces to 70; Dark Reds total pixels=20 within it (exact match in total pixels preserved at 90).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Blue.pixels decreases by an amount related to sum of Dark Red.pixels in shared/adjacent bbox areas. Position (bbox overlap) is required for this interaction.

#### 2. **Blue Bounding Box (Position) → Dark Red Bounding Box (Position)**
   - **Description**: Dark Red components are consistently positioned such that their bounding boxes (bbox) are fully or partially contained within the bbox of a large input Blue component (pixels ≥29). This placement modifies the host Blue's bbox slightly (e.g., minor contraction in y-range).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1: Dark Reds at [2,0,4,1], [15,1,16,3], [7,3,9,5], [4,9,7,12], [13,16,15,18] all within/adjacent to input Blues [0,0,16,4], [0,9,16,14], [0,17,16,18]; host Blues' bboxes contract (e.g., [0,9,16,14] → [0,9,16,13]).
     - Train 2: Dark Reds at [14,0,15,1], [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14] within input Blues [6,5,11,9], [0,0,15,15]; host bboxes unchanged except pixel reduction.
     - Train 3: Dark Reds at [9,5,12,8], [6,11,8,13] within input Blue [4,3,13,12]; host bbox expands slightly in y ([4,3,13,12] → [4,4,13,12]).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Blue.bbox contains or overlaps Dark Red.bbox, triggering bbox modification in Blue (contraction or minor shift). No Dark Reds appear outside all Blue bboxes.

#### 3. **Blue Holes → Dark Red Holes (Count Modification)**
   - **Description**: Input Blues with holes >0 consistently result in output Dark Red components with holes ≥0 placed inside them, leading to a reduction in the host Blue's hole count. The Dark Red's hole count appears to "extract" or represent part of the Blue's holes, but exact mapping (e.g., 1:1 subtraction) is unknown.
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input Blue holes=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → output holes=0, with Dark Red holes=1 inside ([4,9,7,12]); other Blues holes=0 unchanged.
     - Train 2: Input Blue holes=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → output holes=1 (unchanged but reduced pixels), with Dark Red holes=1 inside ([7,6,9,8]); large Blue holes=3 →1, with two Dark Reds holes=1 each.
     - Train 3: Input Blue holes=2 ([4,3,13,12]) → output holes=1, with Dark Red holes=2 inside ([9,5,12,8]) and another holes=1 ([6,11,8,13]).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Blue.holes (>0) decreases upon introduction of Dark Red.holes (≥0) within its bbox. This only occurs for Blues with initial holes >0; hole-less Blues remain hole-less.

#### Unknowns/Not Consistently Interconnected
- **Pixel Total Preservation**: Input and output total blue + red pixels are roughly similar (variance ≤3 in Trains 1-2), but not exactly consistent (Train 3 matches perfectly), so no reliable interaction identified.
- **Small Blue Components (pixels=1)**: These appear in inputs but their transformation (e.g., removal, absorption into large Blues, or creation of new small Blues in outputs) varies and does not consistently interact with Dark Reds or large Blues across all trains.
- **Color Introduction**: Dark Red is newly introduced in all outputs, but no consistent property (e.g., specific Blue shape → color change) triggers it beyond the above position/holes interactions.
- **Exact Shape Properties (e.g., Edges, Silhouettes)**: Bbox and holes provide position/hole info, but no consistent edge or silhouette-based interactions (e.g., L-shape orientation affecting movement) can be identified from the data, as shapes are not explicitly described beyond bbox.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., position → color, hole count → transformation type) were identifiable without forcing unsupported connections. Test inputs were not analyzed, as instructions focus on train examples for consistency.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:53:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns where one element's property (e.g., position, holes, pixels) directly influences or modifies another, without inferring broader puzzle logic or semantics. No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Connections that are not present in all trains (e.g., handling of single-pixel Blue components, which vary—sometimes preserved, sometimes absent) are excluded. If a transformation (e.g., exact pixel subtraction mechanism) cannot be directly tied to a consistent property interaction, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Blue Pixel Count → Dark Red Pixel Count (Subtractive Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The pixel count of large Blue components (those with pixels ≥29) consistently decreases in the output, with the reduction correlating to the total pixel count of overlapping or contained Dark Red components. Dark Red pixels effectively "subtract" from the host Blue's pixels.
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1: Large Blues (pixels=82, 83, 33) reduce to 67, 70, 26; Dark Reds total pixels=38 within/near them (exact subtraction unknown due to minor total pixel variance ~3).
     - Train 2: Large Blues (pixels=29, 164) reduce to 21, 139; Dark Reds total pixels=32 within/near them (exact subtraction unknown due to minor total pixel variance).
     - Train 3: Large Blue (pixels=88) reduces to 70; Dark Reds total pixels=20 within it (exact match in total pixels preserved at 90).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Blue.pixels decreases by an amount related to sum of Dark Red.pixels in shared/adjacent bbox areas. Position (bbox overlap) is required for this interaction.

#### 2. **Blue Bounding Box (Position) → Dark Red Bounding Box (Position)**
   - **Description**: Dark Red components are consistently positioned such that their bounding boxes (bbox) are fully or partially contained within the bbox of a large input Blue component (pixels ≥29). This placement modifies the host Blue's bbox slightly (e.g., minor contraction in y-range).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1: Dark Reds at [2,0,4,1], [15,1,16,3], [7,3,9,5], [4,9,7,12], [13,16,15,18] all within/adjacent to input Blues [0,0,16,4], [0,9,16,14], [0,17,16,18]; host Blues' bboxes contract (e.g., [0,9,16,14] → [0,9,16,13]).
     - Train 2: Dark Reds at [14,0,15,1], [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8], [5,12,8,14] within input Blues [6,5,11,9], [0,0,15,15]; host bboxes unchanged except pixel reduction.
     - Train 3: Dark Reds at [9,5,12,8], [6,11,8,13] within input Blue [4,3,13,12]; host bbox expands slightly in y ([4,3,13,12] → [4,4,13,12]).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Blue.bbox contains or overlaps Dark Red.bbox, triggering bbox modification in Blue (contraction or minor shift). No Dark Reds appear outside all Blue bboxes.

#### 3. **Blue Holes → Dark Red Holes (Count Modification)**
   - **Description**: Input Blues with holes >0 consistently result in output Dark Red components with holes ≥0 placed inside them, leading to a reduction in the host Blue's hole count. The Dark Red's hole count appears to "extract" or represent part of the Blue's holes, but exact mapping (e.g., 1:1 subtraction) is unknown.
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input Blue holes=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → output holes=0, with Dark Red holes=1 inside ([4,9,7,12]); other Blues holes=0 unchanged.
     - Train 2: Input Blue holes=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → output holes=1 (unchanged but reduced pixels), with Dark Red holes=1 inside ([7,6,9,8]); large Blue holes=3 →1, with two Dark Reds holes=1 each.
     - Train 3: Input Blue holes=2 ([4,3,13,12]) → output holes=1, with Dark Red holes=2 inside ([9,5,12,8]) and another holes=1 ([6,11,8,13]).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Blue.holes (>0) decreases upon introduction of Dark Red.holes (≥0) within its bbox. This only occurs for Blues with initial holes >0; hole-less Blues remain hole-less.

#### Unknowns/Not Consistently Interconnected
- **Pixel Total Preservation**: Input and output total blue + red pixels are roughly similar (variance ≤3 in Trains 1-2), but not exactly consistent (Train 3 matches perfectly), so no reliable interaction identified.
- **Small Blue Components (pixels=1)**: These appear in inputs but their transformation (e.g., removal, absorption into large Blues, or creation of new small Blues in outputs) varies and does not consistently interact with Dark Reds or large Blues across all trains.
- **Color Introduction**: Dark Red is newly introduced in all outputs, but no consistent property (e.g., specific Blue shape → color change) triggers it beyond the above position/holes interactions.
- **Exact Shape Properties (e.g., Edges, Silhouettes)**: Bbox and holes provide position/hole info, but no consistent edge or silhouette-based interactions (e.g., L-shape orientation affecting movement) can be identified from the data, as shapes are not explicitly described beyond bbox.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., position → color, hole count → transformation type) were identifiable without forcing unsupported connections. Test inputs were not analyzed, as instructions focus on train examples for consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:58:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary image processing on a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/objects), where the goal is to clean up noise by removing small connected components of 1s, identify and fill small enclosed holes (internal 0-regions not connected to the border background) by dilating their boundaries to 7s, and handle isolated border 0s similarly as small holes. The output modifies the original grid: small 1-components become 0s, small holes get dilated boundaries marked as 7s (while keeping hole interiors as 0s), and larger structures remain intact.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), not diagonal.
 * Background 0s are all 0-regions reachable from the grid borders via flood-fill; any internal 0s not reachable are enclosed holes.
 * Small 1-components are defined as size <2 (single isolated 1s), which get set to 0; larger 1-groups (size >=2) are preserved as objects.
 * Small holes are enclosed 0-components of size <=3, plus any single isolated 0s on the border; these are not filled entirely but dilated: surrounding pixels (3x3 neighborhood, excluding the hole itself) are set to 7 to "highlight" or expand the boundary.
 * Dilation for holes only affects non-hole pixels (e.g., 1s become 7s); hole pixels stay 0.
 * Border single 0s are treated as small holes even if connected to background, but only if truly isolated (no adjacent 0s).
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects, varying sizes, and holes of different scales; larger holes (>3) are left as 0s without dilation.
 * Bottom rows or edges may have partial structures or all-0 lines that should not be altered unless they qualify as small components/holes.
 * Subtle: In get_background_positions, ensure flood-fill starts only from border 0s and marks all reachable 0s; enclosed 0s are the complement.
 * Subtle: In dilation, the 3x3 kernel around each small hole pixel should union across the component, but avoid overwriting hole 0s.
 * Subtle: After removing small 1s, re-evaluate holes on the original grid (not the cleaned one) to avoid altering hole detection.
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s that are single but adjacent to 1s might need special handling; also, holes touching borders aren't enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: In get_zero_components, it operates only on enclosed set, but assumes enclosed positions are valid; rows/cols inferred from max coords may fail if enclosed is empty.
 * Consideration: Outputs use 7 for dilated boundaries, 0 for holes/interiors/background, 1 for preserved objects; no other values.
 * All processing should preserve grid dimensions and non-qualifying pixels unchanged.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it implements core logic for small 1-removal and small hole dilation but fails all training examples due to incorrect hole identification and dilation placement.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly dilates some areas (e.g., row 3 col 7-9 missing 7s, row 4 col 7=0 but expected 7, row 5 col 7-9=7 but expected 0 in hole? Wait, differences in hole dilation: generated has extra 7s in row 16-17 and misses 7s in row 12 col 7, row 16 col 13-15=0 but expected 7s; also row 4 col 16=7 expected 7 but surrounding mismatch; unknown why dilation skips some boundaries.
 * Train 2: Generated adds unwanted 7s (e.g., row 8 col 13=1 but expected 1? Wait, row 8 col 13=0 expected 0, but row 9 col 13=1 expected 1, main issue: misses dilation in row 6 col 13-15=7 expected 7 but row 9 col 13=1 instead of expected 1? Differences: generated has row 6 col 13=0 but expected 7? No, row 6: generated [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] vs expected [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] - match? Wait, actual diff in row 15? Generated misses some 7s in lower parts; unknown, but border handling wrong as row 0 col 14=7 expected 7 but propagation fails.
 * Train 3: Generated incorrectly removes a small 1 in row 3 col 6=1 (sets to 0, but expected preserved? No, expected row 3 all 0s, but generated has it; main: misses dilation entirely in lower object (rows 11-13 expected 7s around hole at row 12 col 7=0, but generated has no 7s there, keeps all 1s; also row 13 col 6=0 expected 0 but no dilation; upper hole dilation partial, e.g., row 5 col 9-11=7 expected 7 but row 7 col 11=0 expected 0 match, but lower fails completely.
 * remove_small_components works for isolating noise but applied too early, before hole detection on original.
 * get_background_positions seems correct but may miss if borders have 1s blocking.
 * get_border_single_zeros is broken/not helpful: it checks isolation but enqueues only borders and marks visited prematurely, leading to missing some singles; also overlaps with background flood-fill, causing double-counting or skips.
 * dilate_small_holes is partially helpful but flawed: it unions 3x3 around holes and sets non-hole to 7, but in examples, it over-dilates (e.g., Train 1 row 1 col 3-4=7 expected 7 match but extends wrongly) or under-dilates (Train 3 lower hole untouched); doesn't exclude background 0s properly, and to_change includes holes themselves sometimes.
 * get_zero_components helpful but assumes enclosed from original grid; in program, enclosed computed on original g, good, but rows/cols from max may be inaccurate if grid larger.
 * Overall: Program structure good (clean 1s first, find holes on original, dilate), but border singles mishandled, dilation kernel applies to wrong pixels (e.g., sets some 0s to 7 incorrectly), and small hole threshold <=3 includes border singles but logic buggy.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies dilation to what seems a large internal hole (rows 4-10, cols 4-10 area with 0s turned to 7 boundaries), but over-dilates into the left 1-structure (e.g., row 4 col 4=7 but likely should be 1 if part of large object) and misses potential small holes elsewhere (e.g., row 11 col 6=0 isolated? but no 7 around it; also right side row 4 col 12=1 expected preserved but if small, removed? Unknown without expected, but looks like it treats a medium hole as small, adding 7s in row 7 col 3=0? Wait, generated has 7s in unexpected places like row 7 col 11=7 but may be overreach; bottom all-0 rows unchanged good, but upper left 1s dilated wrongly into 7s at row 4 col 4-6. It makes partial sense for one hole but ignores object connectivity, leading to broken shapes.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 14:59:22] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear in **every** train example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs) and demonstrate clear cause-effect or mutual influence relationships. Only consistent patterns across all examples are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific pixel counts without relational change, non-interacting bbox dimensions) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are provided. Where a connection involves an unexplainable transformation (e.g., exact mechanism of change), it is explicitly noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Color Transformation Between Blue and Dark Red Components**
   - **Interaction**: Blue pixels in input components are consistently partially converted to Dark Red in outputs, creating new Dark Red components while reducing the size of surviving Blue components. This is a direct pixel-level effect where input Blue pixels do not remain unchanged—some are recolored to Dark Red.
   - **Consistency**: Present in all train examples. No input has Dark Red; all outputs introduce Dark Red derived from input Blue pixels.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Pixel count: Surviving Blue components always have strictly fewer pixels than their corresponding input Blue counterparts (e.g., reductions of 15, 13, 5 pixels in train 1; 8, 25, 1 in train 2; 18, 2 in train 3). The total pixel reduction in Blue approximately equals the total pixels in new Dark Red components (exact in train 3, near-exact in trains 1-2, suggesting minor detection variance).
     - Position: Dark Red components emerge at positions overlapping or within the spatial extent (bbox) of input Blue components, indicating a positional dependency where Blue areas "source" the Dark Red creation.
   - **Unknown**: The specific rule or trigger for which Blue pixels are selected for conversion to Dark Red (transformation mechanism unexplainable from data).

#### 2. **Disappearance of Small 1-Pixel Blue Components and Influence on Larger Structures**
   - **Interaction**: All small 1-pixel Blue components (bbox as single points, pixels=1, holes=0) in inputs consistently disappear entirely in outputs, with their pixels contributing to the overall Blue-to-Dark Red conversion process. Their presence affects larger Blue components by correlating with reductions or modifications in those larger areas, but they do not persist as Blue.
   - **Consistency**: Every input has at least one such small Blue (2 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 2 in train 3); none appear in any output. Their pixel loss (1 per small) is absorbed into the total Blue reduction, which feeds Dark Red creation.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position: The x/y coordinates of small Blues in inputs show loose spatial correlation with the appearance of some Dark Red components in outputs (e.g., right-edge smalls in trains 1-3 link to right/edge Dark Reds; left/bottom smalls link to internal/bottom Dark Reds). This suggests positional influence on where conversions occur in larger Blues.
     - Integration with larger components: Small Blues' disappearance amplifies pixel reductions in co-located large Blue components (e.g., small at y=15 in train 1 affects bottom Blue reduction; small at y=8 in train 2 affects inner Blue reduction).
   - **Unknown**: The precise way small Blue positions dictate Dark Red placement or shape within larger Blues (e.g., direction/amount of shift; transformation unexplainable).

#### 3. **Hole Count Changes in Large Blue Components Due to Internal Modifications**
   - **Interaction**: Holes in large input Blue components (pixels >30, multi-unit bbox, holes ≥0) are affected by the Blue-to-Dark Red conversion, resulting in hole counts that either decrease or remain the same in surviving output Blue components. This indicates that the recoloring process interacts with enclosed spaces (holes), potentially filling, merging, or splitting them without increasing their number.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all large Blues across trains (e.g., train 1: 1→0, 0→0; train 2: 3→1, 1→1; train 3: 2→1). No large Blue gains holes in output.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Hole count: Direct reduction or stability (e.g., from 3 to 1 in train 2 large; 2 to 1 in train 3), tied to pixel conversion—Dark Red components often appear near or enclosing former hole areas (e.g., Dark Reds with holes=1 or 2 in outputs mirror input hole positions).
     - Bbox adjustment: When holes decrease, the bbox of the surviving Blue often shifts slightly (e.g., y-start increases in train 1 middle and train 3 large), suggesting hole-related boundary changes from internal Dark Red creation.
   - **Unknown**: How exactly the conversion process reduces holes (e.g., whether Dark Red "fills" holes or merges enclosures; transformation unexplainable).

#### 4. **Bounding Box Adjustments in Surviving Large Blue Components**
   - **Interaction**: The bbox of large input Blue components influences the bbox of corresponding output Blue components, with consistent minor positional shifts or contractions due to Dark Red emergence within them. This creates a spatial dependency where input boundaries constrain output Blue shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Every large input Blue has a surviving (reduced) Blue counterpart in output with an overlapping or subset bbox (e.g., train 1 top: [0,0,16,4] unchanged; middle: [0,9,16,14] → [0,9,16,13] y-end contracts; train 2: bboxes identical for inner/large; train 3: [4,3,13,12] → [4,4,13,12] y-start shifts).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position/dimensions: Output bboxes are subsets or adjacent shifts of input bboxes (width/height reduces or edge moves by 1-2 units), directly tied to Dark Red positions inside (e.g., Dark Red at edges causes bbox contraction).
     - Link to pixels/holes: Shifts correlate with pixel reduction and hole changes (e.g., y-shifts in trains 1 and 3 align with hole decreases).
   - **Unknown**: The rule for direction/magnitude of bbox shifts (e.g., why y-start vs. y-end; transformation unexplainable beyond general contraction).

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections identifiable. No other elements (e.g., exact Dark Red hole patterns, non-small Blues, or isolated pixel totals) show uniform interaction across all examples. Test inputs are not analyzed here, as the task focuses on deriving consistencies from train data.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear in **every** train example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs) and demonstrate clear cause-effect or mutual influence relationships. Only consistent patterns across all examples are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific pixel counts without relational change, non-interacting bbox dimensions) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are provided. Where a connection involves an unexplainable transformation (e.g., exact mechanism of change), it is explicitly noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Color Transformation Between Blue and Dark Red Components**
   - **Interaction**: Blue pixels in input components are consistently partially converted to Dark Red in outputs, creating new Dark Red components while reducing the size of surviving Blue components. This is a direct pixel-level effect where input Blue pixels do not remain unchanged—some are recolored to Dark Red.
   - **Consistency**: Present in all train examples. No input has Dark Red; all outputs introduce Dark Red derived from input Blue pixels.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Pixel count: Surviving Blue components always have strictly fewer pixels than their corresponding input Blue counterparts (e.g., reductions of 15, 13, 5 pixels in train 1; 8, 25, 1 in train 2; 18, 2 in train 3). The total pixel reduction in Blue approximately equals the total pixels in new Dark Red components (exact in train 3, near-exact in trains 1-2, suggesting minor detection variance).
     - Position: Dark Red components emerge at positions overlapping or within the spatial extent (bbox) of input Blue components, indicating a positional dependency where Blue areas "source" the Dark Red creation.
   - **Unknown**: The specific rule or trigger for which Blue pixels are selected for conversion to Dark Red (transformation mechanism unexplainable from data).

#### 2. **Disappearance of Small 1-Pixel Blue Components and Influence on Larger Structures**
   - **Interaction**: All small 1-pixel Blue components (bbox as single points, pixels=1, holes=0) in inputs consistently disappear entirely in outputs, with their pixels contributing to the overall Blue-to-Dark Red conversion process. Their presence affects larger Blue components by correlating with reductions or modifications in those larger areas, but they do not persist as Blue.
   - **Consistency**: Every input has at least one such small Blue (2 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 2 in train 3); none appear in any output. Their pixel loss (1 per small) is absorbed into the total Blue reduction, which feeds Dark Red creation.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position: The x/y coordinates of small Blues in inputs show loose spatial correlation with the appearance of some Dark Red components in outputs (e.g., right-edge smalls in trains 1-3 link to right/edge Dark Reds; left/bottom smalls link to internal/bottom Dark Reds). This suggests positional influence on where conversions occur in larger Blues.
     - Integration with larger components: Small Blues' disappearance amplifies pixel reductions in co-located large Blue components (e.g., small at y=15 in train 1 affects bottom Blue reduction; small at y=8 in train 2 affects inner Blue reduction).
   - **Unknown**: The precise way small Blue positions dictate Dark Red placement or shape within larger Blues (e.g., direction/amount of shift; transformation unexplainable).

#### 3. **Hole Count Changes in Large Blue Components Due to Internal Modifications**
   - **Interaction**: Holes in large input Blue components (pixels >30, multi-unit bbox, holes ≥0) are affected by the Blue-to-Dark Red conversion, resulting in hole counts that either decrease or remain the same in surviving output Blue components. This indicates that the recoloring process interacts with enclosed spaces (holes), potentially filling, merging, or splitting them without increasing their number.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all large Blues across trains (e.g., train 1: 1→0, 0→0; train 2: 3→1, 1→1; train 3: 2→1). No large Blue gains holes in output.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Hole count: Direct reduction or stability (e.g., from 3 to 1 in train 2 large; 2 to 1 in train 3), tied to pixel conversion—Dark Red components often appear near or enclosing former hole areas (e.g., Dark Reds with holes=1 or 2 in outputs mirror input hole positions).
     - Bbox adjustment: When holes decrease, the bbox of the surviving Blue often shifts slightly (e.g., y-start increases in train 1 middle and train 3 large), suggesting hole-related boundary changes from internal Dark Red creation.
   - **Unknown**: How exactly the conversion process reduces holes (e.g., whether Dark Red "fills" holes or merges enclosures; transformation unexplainable).

#### 4. **Bounding Box Adjustments in Surviving Large Blue Components**
   - **Interaction**: The bbox of large input Blue components influences the bbox of corresponding output Blue components, with consistent minor positional shifts or contractions due to Dark Red emergence within them. This creates a spatial dependency where input boundaries constrain output Blue shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Every large input Blue has a surviving (reduced) Blue counterpart in output with an overlapping or subset bbox (e.g., train 1 top: [0,0,16,4] unchanged; middle: [0,9,16,14] → [0,9,16,13] y-end contracts; train 2: bboxes identical for inner/large; train 3: [4,3,13,12] → [4,4,13,12] y-start shifts).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position/dimensions: Output bboxes are subsets or adjacent shifts of input bboxes (width/height reduces or edge moves by 1-2 units), directly tied to Dark Red positions inside (e.g., Dark Red at edges causes bbox contraction).
     - Link to pixels/holes: Shifts correlate with pixel reduction and hole changes (e.g., y-shifts in trains 1 and 3 align with hole decreases).
   - **Unknown**: The rule for direction/magnitude of bbox shifts (e.g., why y-start vs. y-end; transformation unexplainable beyond general contraction).

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections identifiable. No other elements (e.g., exact Dark Red hole patterns, non-small Blues, or isolated pixel totals) show uniform interaction across all examples. Test inputs are not analyzed here, as the task focuses on deriving consistencies from train data.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:04:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing (0s as background/empty, 1s as foreground/objects) to clean up noise, identify and mark internal boundaries or enclosed "pockets" within connected components of 1s using the value 7, while preserving the overall structure. The goal appears to be morphological-like operations: remove small isolated 1s, then detect and highlight internal edges or fill specific open/near-open holes that are almost enclosed by 1s (e.g., 3-sided pockets), but only in certain orientations or conditions to match subtle enclosure rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune small components first: Remove 1s with fewer than 2 orthogonal (4-dir) neighbors to eliminate noise or isolated pixels/lines, but only apply this before other steps to avoid altering main structures.
 * Internal boundaries (7s): Placed on 1s adjacent (8-dir) to 0s that are "qualifying" (the 0 has >=3 orthogonal 1-neighbors, indicating near-enclosure), but this must be precise—over-marking happens if not checking for full enclosure or specific topologies; avoid marking outer boundaries or open edges.
 * Open pockets filling: For 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (a "pocket" open on one side), fill related areas with 7, but only if the open side is specific (e.g., horizontal for certain cases, or conditional on grid position like below midline); this is orientation-sensitive and may propagate fills horizontally or vertically, but current logic fails on directionality and overfills/underfills.
 * Subtle elements: 7s represent internal/diagonal boundaries or filled holes, but not all holes—only those that are "internal" or "almost closed" (e.g., triply-adjacent 0s); distinguish between fully enclosed 0s (leave as 0) and boundary-adjacent ones; consider grid symmetry/asymmetry (e.g., bottom-heavy fills); process order matters (prune -> fill pockets -> set boundaries) to avoid interfering changes; 8-dir for adjacency checks but 4-dir for neighbor counts; edge cases like diagonal connections, single-pixel holes, or pockets near grid borders; no changes to 0s unless explicitly filling, and 1s only become 7 if internal.
 * Across attempts: No extraction of connected components (e.g., flood-fill to identify blobs) was used, leading to global over-application; missing checks for enclosure topology (e.g., is the 0 part of a larger hole?); propagation in fill_open_pockets is buggy (e.g., only handles vertical opens poorly, ignores horizontal fully); set_internal_boundaries over-marks if not filtering for true internals vs. concavities; prune_small_components works partially but may remove valid small parts if <2 neighbors threshold is too strict for chains.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (varying h/w, but consistent per example); outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving 0s in open areas; test inputs may have asymmetric structures requiring direction-specific rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions show partial understanding but are mostly broken or incomplete—prune_small_components is somewhat helpful for noise removal but applies too broadly (single pass may miss iterative pruning); set_internal_boundaries captures the idea of qualifying 0s but over-applies 7s without topology checks; fill_open_pockets attempts pocket detection but has flawed propagation (e.g., only partial horizontal fill for vertical opens, and arbitrary midline condition); no connected component labeling, which would be essential for isolating objects and checking per-blob enclosures.

No other helpful tools; missing: connected component extraction (e.g., DFS/BFS to label blobs and compute per-blob properties like hole count or boundary type), which would help isolate issues.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) demonstrates partial understanding of noise pruning and internal marking but fails all training examples due to imprecise pocket filling and boundary detection.
 * prune_small_components works for removing isolates but doesn't iteratively prune chains, leading to residual small 1s in some cases (though not the main failure here).
 * set_internal_boundaries over-marks 1s as 7 near any 3+ neighbor 0, causing extra 7s in semi-open areas (e.g., Train1 rows 11-12: generates 7,7,7,7 where expected 7,7,0,7 and 7,0,0,7—fills holes prematurely without checking openness).
 * fill_open_pockets under-detects/under-fills pockets: e.g., Train1 lower structure misses 0s in expected holes (generates solid 7s); Train2 top-right: generates 0 and 1 where expected 7,0 and 7,7 (fails to fill near-edge pocket); Train3 row12: generates 7,7,7 where expected 7,0,7 (overfills a specific internal 0).
 * Order of operations (prune -> fill -> boundaries) is logical but interactions cause errors, like fills altering what boundaries see.
 * No component extraction used, so global rules apply blindly—essential for handling multiple objects separately.
 * Function fill_open_pockets is broken (directional bias, midline hack) and not helpful—avoid or rewrite with better open-side detection.
 * set_internal_boundaries is partially helpful but incorrect for non-fully-enclosed 0s—don't use without enclosure check.
 * Overall, misses subtle topology: e.g., Train1/3 have specific 0s preserved inside near-holes, but attempt fills them; Train2 edge pockets need vertical fills upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in what seem like internal areas of a large blob (e.g., rows 4-11 show 7s in concavities), but it does not look fully correct: overfills some pockets (e.g., row5 col5: 0 where likely should be 7 or preserved based on enclosure, but hard to tell without expected; compares to training patterns, it solidifies areas like row7 col3:0 which may be an open pocket needing partial 7); underfills edges (e.g., row2 col10-12:7,7,7 but if analogous to Train2, might need more/less); structure has asymmetric 7s (e.g., left-heavy in rows 6-8) that may ignore horizontal propagation rules seen in failures. It partially makes sense for a connected blob but mismatches training subtleties (e.g., preserves some 0s incorrectly inside, like row6 col5:0), suggesting same bugs as training—likely incorrect due to over-marking internals without precise openness checks.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 15:04:40] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 15:05:03] Response:
- **Color -> Component Creation**: Input components are exclusively Blue; output consistently introduces new Dark Red components alongside modified Blue components. This transformation is consistent across all train examples, where Dark Red emerges from subsets of Blue areas.
- **Pixel Count -> Pixel Count**: Total pixels across all components are conserved (exact in Train 3, approximate within ~1-2% in Trains 1 and 2, possibly due to boundary effects). Specifically, pixel counts in output Blue components are consistently reduced compared to matching input Blue components, with the difference appearing as pixel counts in new Dark Red components.
- **Bounding Box (Position) -> Bounding Box (Position)**: Output Blue bounding boxes are consistently similar to input Blue bounding boxes but slightly adjusted (e.g., minor shifts or shrinks in y-range, like [0,9,16,14] to [0,9,16,13] in Train 1, or [4,3,13,12] to [4,4,13,12] in Train 3). Dark Red bounding boxes consistently overlap or are subsets of input Blue bounding boxes (e.g., [4,9,7,12] inside [0,9,16,14] in Train 1; [7,6,9,8] inside [6,5,11,9] in Train 2; [9,5,12,8] and [6,11,8,13] inside [4,3,13,12] in Train 3).
- **Holes -> Holes**: Input Blue components with holes > 0 consistently result in output Blue components with reduced hole counts (e.g., holes=1 to 0 in Train 1's middle component; holes=3 to 1 in Train 2's large component; holes=2 to 1 in Train 3's middle component). New Dark Red components consistently have positive hole counts (≥1 in most cases, except one instance of 0 in Train 2), often totaling a number that relates to the input hole reduction (e.g., one input hole=1 yields two Dark Red with holes=1 in Train 1; input holes=3 yields three Dark Red with holes=1 in Train 2).
- **Holes -> Color**: Blue components with holes > 0 in input consistently spawn Dark Red components (with their own holes) from internal regions, while input Blue with holes=0 may have minor pixel reductions without always creating Dark Red (inconsistent for exact mechanism, but color change tied to hole presence overall).
- **Small Pixel Count (1 pixel) -> Position**: Isolated 1-pixel Blue components in input have inconsistent effects across examples—sometimes contributing to nearby small Dark Red (e.g., input [13,7,13,7] near output [15,1,16,3] in Train 1; input [15,4,15,4] absent in output small DR in Train 3)—no consistent position or transformation rule identifiable.
- **Unknown: Specific Shape/Silhouette -> Transform**: No consistent shape-based interactions (e.g., L-shapes or edges) can be identified from the data, as descriptions lack sufficient detail on silhouettes or edges beyond bboxes and holes; any shape-driven movement or transformation remains unknown without forcing assumptions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 15:05:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- **Color -> Component Creation**: Input components are exclusively Blue; output consistently introduces new Dark Red components alongside modified Blue components. This transformation is consistent across all train examples, where Dark Red emerges from subsets of Blue areas.
- **Pixel Count -> Pixel Count**: Total pixels across all components are conserved (exact in Train 3, approximate within ~1-2% in Trains 1 and 2, possibly due to boundary effects). Specifically, pixel counts in output Blue components are consistently reduced compared to matching input Blue components, with the difference appearing as pixel counts in new Dark Red components.
- **Bounding Box (Position) -> Bounding Box (Position)**: Output Blue bounding boxes are consistently similar to input Blue bounding boxes but slightly adjusted (e.g., minor shifts or shrinks in y-range, like [0,9,16,14] to [0,9,16,13] in Train 1, or [4,3,13,12] to [4,4,13,12] in Train 3). Dark Red bounding boxes consistently overlap or are subsets of input Blue bounding boxes (e.g., [4,9,7,12] inside [0,9,16,14] in Train 1; [7,6,9,8] inside [6,5,11,9] in Train 2; [9,5,12,8] and [6,11,8,13] inside [4,3,13,12] in Train 3).
- **Holes -> Holes**: Input Blue components with holes > 0 consistently result in output Blue components with reduced hole counts (e.g., holes=1 to 0 in Train 1's middle component; holes=3 to 1 in Train 2's large component; holes=2 to 1 in Train 3's middle component). New Dark Red components consistently have positive hole counts (≥1 in most cases, except one instance of 0 in Train 2), often totaling a number that relates to the input hole reduction (e.g., one input hole=1 yields two Dark Red with holes=1 in Train 1; input holes=3 yields three Dark Red with holes=1 in Train 2).
- **Holes -> Color**: Blue components with holes > 0 in input consistently spawn Dark Red components (with their own holes) from internal regions, while input Blue with holes=0 may have minor pixel reductions without always creating Dark Red (inconsistent for exact mechanism, but color change tied to hole presence overall).
- **Small Pixel Count (1 pixel) -> Position**: Isolated 1-pixel Blue components in input have inconsistent effects across examples—sometimes contributing to nearby small Dark Red (e.g., input [13,7,13,7] near output [15,1,16,3] in Train 1; input [15,4,15,4] absent in output small DR in Train 3)—no consistent position or transformation rule identifiable.
- **Unknown: Specific Shape/Silhouette -> Transform**: No consistent shape-based interactions (e.g., L-shapes or edges) can be identified from the data, as descriptions lack sufficient detail on silhouettes or edges beyond bboxes and holes; any shape-driven movement or transformation remains unknown without forcing assumptions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 15:07:43] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 15:08:02] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0 for empty, 1 for filled shapes) where the goal is to detect "cores" (internal holes or enclosed 0s with sufficient surrounding 1s), remove thin or protruding parts of shapes that are not structurally significant, and highlight boundary or adjacent areas around cores with 7 (likely representing dark red outlining or emphasis) while preserving the overall shape integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Cores are strictly defined as 0 cells with at least 3 orthogonal (up/down/left/right) 1 neighbors; diagonal neighbors do not count, and cores must be internal voids, not edge or open spaces.
 * Thin protrusions are 1 cells with fewer than 2 orthogonal 1 neighbors; these should be removed (set to 0) to simplify shapes, but only after core detection, and removals should not override core-adjacent highlighting.
 * Highlighting with 7 occurs around cores using 8-directional neighbors (including diagonals), but skips other cores and prioritizes setting 1s or low-connectivity 0s to 7; however, this must integrate with protrusion removal—e.g., a thin protrusion near a core might stay as 1 or get set to 7 instead of 0.
 * Subtlety: Highlighting applies to the original grid, but final output overrides thin removals only if not already set to 7, which can lead to incomplete outlining if thin parts are not reconsidered post-highlighting.
 * Grids have varying sizes but consistent structure (e.g., multiple disconnected shapes or "objects"); processing must handle all independently without assuming connectivity.
 * 7s form outlines or "dark red" borders around holes/cores, but only on non-core cells; avoid setting cores themselves or isolated 0s to 7 unless they meet low-connectivity criteria.
 * Easy to miss: Orthogonal-only for core detection and protrusion removal, but 8-directional for highlighting spread; also, protrusion removal uses the original grid, not an iterative process, which can miss chained thins.
 * Integration order matters: Detect cores first on original, remove thins separately, then apply highlighting, and finally reconcile (e.g., keep thin removals as 0 unless highlighting sets to 7).
 * No changes to existing 0s unless they are near cores and low-connectivity; shapes should remain mostly 1s except for removals and highlights.
 * Potential for multiple cores per shape; highlighting must not overlap destructively or fill holes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from copy import deepcopy

def num_ortho_ones(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    directions: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni = i + di
        nj = j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is helpful for core detection and protrusion checks, as it correctly counts only orthogonal 1 neighbors.)

```python
def identify_cores(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return set()
    cols = len(grid[0])
    cores: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) >= 3:
                cores.add((i, j))
    return cores
```
(This accurately identifies core positions and is essential for targeting highlighting.)

```python
def remove_thin_protrusions(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(grid[0])
    out = deepcopy(grid)
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) < 2:
                out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This is useful for simplifying shapes by removing low-connectivity 1s, but note it is non-iterative and based on original grid.)

```python
def get_neighbor_deltas() -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    deltas: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if di != 0 or dj != 0:
                deltas.append((di, dj))
    return deltas
```
(This provides 8-directional neighbors for highlighting spread around cores, which is key for outlining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly handled training example 3 (full match, demonstrating core detection and basic highlighting/removal work for simple cases), but failed training 1 and 2 due to incomplete 7 highlighting on certain boundary cells.
 * In training 1, generated output mismatches expected at row 12, column 7 (0-based: position (12,7) is 1 in generated but 7 in expected), and possibly others; this suggests highlighting did not propagate to all adjacent non-thin 1s near cores, leaving part of a core outline as 1 instead of 7.
 * In training 2, generated output mismatches expected in the top rows (e.g., row 0 column 14 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected; row 0 column 15 is 0 in generated but nothing shown, but overall top-right area lacks 7s), and row 8 column 13 is 1 in generated but expected has 7 there; this indicates failure to highlight thin or edge areas near cores in the upper shape.
 * The reconciliation step in program() overrides thin removals to 0 only if not 7, but this missed setting some 1s to 7 in original positions that were thin but core-adjacent (e.g., should prioritize 7 over removal in borders).
 * Core detection worked (as seen in correct training 3), but set_dark_red_around_holes is incomplete: it sets 7 on 1s or low-ortho 0s near cores, but skips if ortho_count >=2 for 0s, which may miss subtle hole boundaries; also, it uses original grid but doesn't fully integrate with temp_grid removals.
 * remove_thin_protrusions is helpful but non-iterative, potentially leaving pseudo-thin structures if multiple passes are needed (though not evident in examples).
 * No extraction of full objects/shapes was attempted, which might help for disconnected components, but current per-cell approach works for cores; adding object flooding could isolate shapes but isn't necessary yet.
 * The program assumes uniform grid size per row, which holds, but doesn't handle empty grids gracefully beyond basics.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on rules: it correctly identifies a core-like area in the middle-right (e.g., 7s around what seems a hole at ~row 4-11, col 10-12), removes some left-side thins (many 0s on left), and outlines with 7s in 8 directions, but it looks incorrect overall because the large central shape's hole outlining is inconsistent—e.g., row 5 col 5 is 0 (possible thin removal or hole extension) but adjacent 7s suggest incomplete fill/prevention of hole spillover, and top-left shape has no 7s despite potential internal voids.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have more precise 7 outlining around the evident hole in the bottom-left-ish shape (rows 3-12, cols 0-14), setting 7s on all 8-neighbor borders without leaving isolated 1s inside (e.g., row 7 col 3 is 0 in generated, but if it's a thin near core, it should be 7 or removed consistently); also, right-side protrusions (col 14-15) have scattered 0s that seem over-removed, missing 7 borders.
 * The test output does not fully look correct: It over-applies 0s in thin areas without reconciling to 7 (e.g., row 3 col 13 is 1 but surrounded by 0s, should be removed or highlighted if near core), and the bottom shape (rows 10-12) has 7s that don't close the outline properly, suggesting the highlighting function missed some deltas or low-connectivity checks.
 * To handle test case, need to ensure highlighting scans all core neighbors post-removal and sets 7 on any remaining 1s or adjacent 0s <2 ortho, avoiding the generated's patchy borders.

[2025-10-03 15:08:08] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 15:08:35] Response:
### Interconnected Components and Properties
Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following components and properties are identified. Only those with obvious, direct interactions or effects that are consistent across **every** train example are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., empty spaces, which show no consistent interaction with colors, shapes, or transformations) are excluded. Inconsistent or forced connections (e.g., exact pixel matching between specific regions or semantic meanings like "movement direction") are not included. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly explained from the data, it is noted as unknown.

#### Components
- **Blue regions**: Present in both input and output. Defined by properties: bounding box (bbox for position), hole count (holes, integer ≥0 indicating enclosed empty areas), and pixel count (pixels, area measure). Serve as base structures; multiple per example, varying in size (small: ~1 pixel; large: 30+ pixels).
- **Dark Red regions**: Present only in output. Defined by the same properties as Blue (bbox, holes, pixels). Act as new or modified elements overlaid on or replacing parts of input Blue regions.

#### Interactions and Effects (Consistent Across All Train Examples)
These describe how properties of one component affect or connect to another, or how they transform. Only pairwise or direct effects that hold in every train pair are listed.

1. **Spatial position (bbox) of input Blue regions → position (bbox) of output Dark Red regions**  
   - Effect: Every Dark Red bbox is fully contained within or directly overlaps an input Blue bbox (no Dark Red appears outside input Blue spatial extents). This indicates positional dependency, where output Dark Red is constrained to input Blue locations.  
   - Consistency: Observed in all examples (e.g., Train 1: all 5 Dark Red within input [0,0,16,4] or [0,9,16,14]; Train 2: all 4 Dark Red within [0,0,15,15]; Train 3: both Dark Red within [4,3,13,12]).  
   - No further transformation (e.g., exact shift or scaling) is explainable from data—called unknown.

2. **Pixel count (pixels) of input Blue regions → pixel count (pixels) of output Blue + Dark Red regions**  
   - Effect: Total input Blue pixels ≈ total output (Blue pixels + Dark Red pixels), with minor variance (≤1-2 pixels, likely due to edge/rounding). This shows direct pixel-level transformation, where portions of input Blue pixels are converted to Dark Red pixels without net loss or gain. Individual input Blue regions lose pixels (output Blue < input Blue where matched by bbox overlap), with losses matching nearby Dark Red gains.  
   - Consistency: Exact or near-exact conservation in all examples (e.g., Train 1: 200 input → 203 output; Train 2: 194 → 192; Train 3: 90 → 90). Indicates pixels as a conserved property across color change.  
   - Selection of which specific pixels transform (e.g., based on edges or silhouettes) is unknown.

3. **Hole count (holes >0) in input Blue regions → hole count (holes >0) in output Dark Red regions (spatially linked)**  
   - Effect: Every input Blue with holes >0 has at least one output Dark Red with holes >0 positioned within its bbox (via interaction 1). This suggests input holes influence the creation of holed Dark Red in the same area, potentially by "inheriting" or propagating hole properties during transformation. Input regions with holes=0 may or may not produce holed Dark Red (inconsistent).  
   - Consistency: Holds in all examples where input holes >0 exist (e.g., Train 1: input holes=1 → 3 holed Dark Red, one directly in the holed Blue's bbox; Train 2: input holes=4 → 3 holed Dark Red in holed Blues' bboxes; Train 3: input holes=2 → 2 holed Dark Red in the holed Blue's bbox). Total hole counts are not conserved (e.g., can increase).  
   - Exact mechanism (e.g., hole count matching or hole position affecting Dark Red shape) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., color directly affecting movement, small Blue pixel counts → specific Dark Red shapes, or bbox dimensions → hole changes) are obvious from the data. Test inputs are not analyzed, as instructions limit to train examples for identification.

[2025-10-03 15:08:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled cells) through morphological-like operations: removing "thin protrusions" (isolated or barely connected 1s), removing fully isolated 1s, and then highlighting (coloring to 7) any remaining 1s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to small connected components of 0s (size 1 or 2, using 4-connectivity for zeros but 8-connectivity for adjacency checks). The goal is likely to clean up noise in a visual pattern or identify boundaries/features around small holes or gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are rectangular lists of lists with consistent dimensions; assume 0s are background/empty, 1s are foreground/object pixels.
 * Connectivity for zero components uses 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for BFS/flood fill to find small enclosed or open spaces (size <=2).
 * Adjacency for coloring uses 8 directions (including diagonals) to mark 1s touching these small zero components, but only after prior cleaning steps.
 * Cleaning happens sequentially: first remove thin protrusions (1s with >=3 zero neighbors in 4 directions, indicating tips or spurs), then remove isolated 1s (those with 0 one-neighbors in 4 directions).
 * Subtlety: Cleaning modifies a copy of the grid, but coloring uses the original grid for zero detection (to preserve original small holes) while applying to the cleaned grid.
 * Potential misses: Over-removal if protrusions are checked simultaneously without iteration (single pass may leave remnants); small zero components might be open edges, not just enclosed holes; no handling for larger zero components (they shouldn't trigger coloring); diagonal adjacency is key for "touching" but not for zero connectivity.
 * Edge cases: Border cells have fewer neighbors; multiple small zero components per grid; after cleaning, some 1s might become isolated but aren't re-checked; output should preserve 0s and change only specific 1s to 7 (no other values).
 * General: Single-pass operations avoid infinite loops; use BFS for exact component sizing/collection; visited arrays prevent re-processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a sequential pipeline (protrusions -> isolated -> coloring), which aligns with cleaning before highlighting, but fails entirely due to a syntax error in color_adjacent_to_small_zeros (incomplete if-block after first BFS attempt, line 61).
 * remove_thin_protrusions and remove_isolated are syntactically correct and likely work for their parts (single-pass neighbor counting in 4 directions), but untested due to overall error.
 * color_adjacent_to_small_zeros correctly identifies the need for BFS on original g for zeros, collection of small components (<=2), and 8-dir adjacency coloring on cleaned grid, but the code is broken (first BFS lacks body/indentation, leading to execution error; second BFS is good but orphaned).
 * No outputs generated for any example, so nothing "worked" in terms of producing grids; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) resulted in identical ERROR messages.
 * The main_program orchestrates steps correctly (temp_g for cleaning, result for coloring), but inherits the syntax issue.
 * No extraction of objects or other helper functions attempted; focus is purely on grid modifications.
 * Subtle issue: Single-pass cleaning might not handle chained dependencies (e.g., removing a protrusion could isolate another 1), but not addressed here.
 * Train examples 1-3 and test all failed identically (no grids output), differing from expected by not executing at all—expected would be modified grids with 0/1/7 values highlighting small-zero-adjacent areas after cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (syntax failure), so it does not make sense or look correct—it produced no grid at all, just a traceback about indentation after an if-statement.
 * Without execution, it can't match any expected cleaned/highlighted grid; for instance, if the test input has thin 1s, isolated points, or small zero gaps, the output should show removals (to 0) and colorings (to 7), but nothing was generated to compare.
 * This indicates the program can't handle the test input (or any input) due to the bug, missing all puzzle effects like protrusion removal or small-zero highlighting.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid of 0s (empty space) and 1s (solid elements, like walls or blobs), where the goal is to process the grid to identify and mark boundaries of enclosed holes, isolated elements, and various "bay" structures (indentations or openings in the 1s) by changing specific boundary 1s to 7s (indicating marked boundaries), while sometimes setting certain 1s to 0s or skipping markings to avoid over-processing nested or adjacent features. The processing must preserve the overall structure but highlight enclosures and bays without marking open or irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero adjacent 1s in 4 directions) by setting them to 0, as they are not part of any meaningful structure.
 * For enclosed holes (0s fully surrounded by 1s in all 4 directions), mark the 8 surrounding 1s (orthogonal and diagonal) as 7s to highlight the boundary, but only if it's a true enclosure—avoid marking if it's part of a larger open area.
 * Handle "double horizontal bays": Pairs of adjacent 0s in the same row, each with exactly 3 adjacent 1s (indicating a narrow horizontal indentation); mark the side walls (left of first 0, right of second 0) in both the bay row and the row below as 7s, and set any 1s in the centers of the row below to 0s to "fill" or open the bay—include a skip (c +=1) to avoid double-processing overlapping bays.
 * For L-bays (0s with exactly 2 orthogonal adjacent 1s that are not opposites, forming an L-shape), mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal 1 between them as 7s, but skip if the two 1s are opposite (straight line, not L).
 * For single bays (0s with exactly 3 orthogonal adjacent 1s, indicating one open direction), mark the 3 closed orthogonal 1s as 7s and the 2 diagonals on the closed side as 7s; include a skip condition if the open-side adjacent cell is a 0 with 3 adjacent 1s (to avoid marking nested bays); add extra filling for vertical opens by marking 3 horizontal cells in the open direction as 7s if that cell is 0.
 * Process in sequence: isolated removal first, then enclosed holes, then double bays, L-bays, single bays—order matters to avoid interfering with prior markings (e.g., don't mark a bay if it's already resolved as an enclosure).
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals are crucial for enclosures and bays but not for adjacency counts (use 4-dir for neighbors, 8-dir for boundaries); avoid over-marking adjacent structures (e.g., shared walls between bays should not all be marked if it breaks the shape); handle edges/boundaries carefully (check bounds); nested or adjacent bays require skips to prevent cascading errors; vertical/horizontal symmetry isn't assumed, so check all orientations; 7s should only replace 1s, never create new 1s or change 0s to 7s directly.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided), considerations include avoiding double-counting in loops (e.g., c +=1 in double bays), distinguishing L from straight openings, and conditional skips for nested features— but execution often over-marks or under-marks due to incomplete pattern matching.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 17x17 for train 1, 16x16 for test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic.

No extraction functions provided (e.g., no def extract_objects), but the modular rule functions act as such—useful for debugging individual rules.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, but it fails all trainings due to over-marking boundaries (e.g., marking 1s as 7s where they should remain 1s or become 0s) and missing skips for nested structures.
 * Missed handling vertical double bays (only horizontal implemented, causing asymmetry in train 2 row 12-14 where expected has vertical 7s but generated has horizontals).
 * Over-marked in train 1: row 11 has 7,7,7,7 but expected 7,0,0,7 (likely from double bay not setting centers to 0 correctly or L/single interfering); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7 but expected all 1s (enclosed hole or bay overreach); row 14 has 7 at col 8 but expected 0 (isolated marking error).
 * Train 2 mismatches: row 2 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (L-bay falsely triggered); row 5 has 1,7,7,0 but expected 1,1,0,... (single bay over-marks); row 12 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (double bay misses vertical); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7 but expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7 (under-marks vertical bay).
 * Train 3 mismatches: row 3 has 7 at col 6 but expected 0 (enclosed hole falsely marks non-boundary); row 4 has 1,7,7,7,1 but expected 1,1,1,1,1 (single/L bay over-marks open area).
 * Function handle_double_horizontal_bays is partially helpful but broken for vertical cases and over-sets 0s incorrectly in some nestings (don't rely solely, extend to vertical).
 * Function handle_L_bays is unhelpful or incorrect for non-horizontal Ls and triggers falsely on near-opposites (avoid until rotations added).
 * Function handle_single_bays is essential but broken—skip condition insufficient for all nestings, extra fill only vertical (causes most errors in trains); fix diagonals and add horizontal fills.
 * handle_enclosed_holes is mostly helpful but over-marks shared walls in complex blobs (e.g., train 3 row 4).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and likely correct (no obvious errors), but run early.
 * Overall, pipeline order is good, but functions interfere (e.g., bays after holes mark already-resolved areas).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many 1s as 7s in ways that don't align with training expectations, creating irregular boundaries (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 4 and 7,7,7 at cols 10-12, but looks like an open area that should remain 1s; row 5 has scattered 7s/0s in a blob that expected might keep more 1s per train patterns; row 11 has 7s in row 11 col 4-5 but then 0 at col 6 where it might be a bay center needing 0 but sides not marked right; row 12 has 7,7,0 at cols 4-6, suggesting incomplete double bay handling).
 * Compared to trainings, it misses subtle nestings (e.g., potential vertical bays in cols 6-8 not fully marked/skipped, leading to extra 7s in row 7 col 3=0 but surrounded by 7s); over-marks diagonals inappropriately (e.g., row 8 col 12=0 but adjacent 1s marked 7 where expected might be open).
 * Does not make sense for a cohesive enclosure/bay marking—too many isolated 7s (e.g., row 3 col 13=1 unmarked but should be 7 if bay), and the bottom (rows 12-15) has abrupt 7,0,0 patterns like unresolved double bays; to handle test, need better vertical bay detection and stricter skips, as test seems to have more vertical/nested features than horizontal trainings.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing (0s as background/empty, 1s as foreground/objects) to clean up noise, identify and mark internal boundaries or enclosed "pockets" within connected components of 1s using the value 7, while preserving the overall structure. The goal appears to be morphological-like operations: remove small isolated 1s, then detect and highlight internal edges or fill specific open/near-open holes that are almost enclosed by 1s (e.g., 3-sided pockets), but only in certain orientations or conditions to match subtle enclosure rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune small components first: Remove 1s with fewer than 2 orthogonal (4-dir) neighbors to eliminate noise or isolated pixels/lines, but only apply this before other steps to avoid altering main structures.
 * Internal boundaries (7s): Placed on 1s adjacent (8-dir) to 0s that are "qualifying" (the 0 has >=3 orthogonal 1-neighbors, indicating near-enclosure), but this must be precise—over-marking happens if not checking for full enclosure or specific topologies; avoid marking outer boundaries or open edges.
 * Open pockets filling: For 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (a "pocket" open on one side), fill related areas with 7, but only if the open side is specific (e.g., horizontal for certain cases, or conditional on grid position like below midline); this is orientation-sensitive and may propagate fills horizontally or vertically, but current logic fails on directionality and overfills/underfills.
 * Subtle elements: 7s represent internal/diagonal boundaries or filled holes, but not all holes—only those that are "internal" or "almost closed" (e.g., triply-adjacent 0s); distinguish between fully enclosed 0s (leave as 0) and boundary-adjacent ones; consider grid symmetry/asymmetry (e.g., bottom-heavy fills); process order matters (prune -> fill pockets -> set boundaries) to avoid interfering changes; 8-dir for adjacency checks but 4-dir for neighbor counts; edge cases like diagonal connections, single-pixel holes, or pockets near grid borders; no changes to 0s unless explicitly filling, and 1s only become 7 if internal.
 * Across attempts: No extraction of connected components (e.g., flood-fill to identify blobs) was used, leading to global over-application; missing checks for enclosure topology (e.g., is the 0 part of a larger hole?); propagation in fill_open_pockets is buggy (e.g., only handles vertical opens poorly, ignores horizontal fully); set_internal_boundaries over-marks if not filtering for true internals vs. concavities; prune_small_components works partially but may remove valid small parts if <2 neighbors threshold is too strict for chains.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (varying h/w, but consistent per example); outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving 0s in open areas; test inputs may have asymmetric structures requiring direction-specific rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions show partial understanding but are mostly broken or incomplete—prune_small_components is somewhat helpful for noise removal but applies too broadly (single pass may miss iterative pruning); set_internal_boundaries captures the idea of qualifying 0s but over-applies 7s without topology checks; fill_open_pockets attempts pocket detection but has flawed propagation (e.g., only partial horizontal fill for vertical opens, and arbitrary midline condition); no connected component labeling, which would be essential for isolating objects and checking per-blob enclosures.

No other helpful tools; missing: connected component extraction (e.g., DFS/BFS to label blobs and compute per-blob properties like hole count or boundary type), which would help isolate issues.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) demonstrates partial understanding of noise pruning and internal marking but fails all training examples due to imprecise pocket filling and boundary detection.
 * prune_small_components works for removing isolates but doesn't iteratively prune chains, leading to residual small 1s in some cases (though not the main failure here).
 * set_internal_boundaries over-marks 1s as 7 near any 3+ neighbor 0, causing extra 7s in semi-open areas (e.g., Train1 rows 11-12: generates 7,7,7,7 where expected 7,7,0,7 and 7,0,0,7—fills holes prematurely without checking openness).
 * fill_open_pockets under-detects/under-fills pockets: e.g., Train1 lower structure misses 0s in expected holes (generates solid 7s); Train2 top-right: generates 0 and 1 where expected 7,0 and 7,7 (fails to fill near-edge pocket); Train3 row12: generates 7,7,7 where expected 7,0,7 (overfills a specific internal 0).
 * Order of operations (prune -> fill -> boundaries) is logical but interactions cause errors, like fills altering what boundaries see.
 * No component extraction used, so global rules apply blindly—essential for handling multiple objects separately.
 * Function fill_open_pockets is broken (directional bias, midline hack) and not helpful—avoid or rewrite with better open-side detection.
 * set_internal_boundaries is partially helpful but incorrect for non-fully-enclosed 0s—don't use without enclosure check.
 * Overall, misses subtle topology: e.g., Train1/3 have specific 0s preserved inside near-holes, but attempt fills them; Train2 edge pockets need vertical fills upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in what seem like internal areas of a large blob (e.g., rows 4-11 show 7s in concavities), but it does not look fully correct: overfills some pockets (e.g., row5 col5: 0 where likely should be 7 or preserved based on enclosure, but hard to tell without expected; compares to training patterns, it solidifies areas like row7 col3:0 which may be an open pocket needing partial 7); underfills edges (e.g., row2 col10-12:7,7,7 but if analogous to Train2, might need more/less); structure has asymmetric 7s (e.g., left-heavy in rows 6-8) that may ignore horizontal propagation rules seen in failures. It partially makes sense for a connected blob but mismatches training subtleties (e.g., preserves some 0s incorrectly inside, like row6 col5:0), suggesting same bugs as training—likely incorrect due to over-marking internals without precise openness checks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the input to remove isolated 1s and then identify and mark specific enclosed or patterned regions by changing certain 1s to 7s, likely to highlight boundaries, fills, or shapes like loops, bays, or internal areas. The output preserves the overall structure but annotates detectable features, with 7s indicating processed or filled elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't form part of larger structures.
 * For 0 cells (empty spaces), detect surrounding 1s in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) to identify enclosures: full surround (4 neighbors) fills all eight surrounding cells with 7 if they are 1s; 3 neighbors indicate an open bay, filling closed sides and interior/exterior based on open direction, with conditions for low-adjacency cells; 2 neighbors handle corner-like or L-shaped opens by filling specific adjacent 1s.
 * Subtlety in 3-neighbor case: Interior fill is always 3 cells in the closed direction, but exterior/open-side fill only applies if the open-side cell is internal (0) and has <2 neighbors, or if already 1 (always fill); this prevents overfilling unbounded areas.
 * Subtlety in 2-neighbor case: Only specific diagonal pairs of neighbors (e.g., left+down but not up+right) trigger fills of 3-cell L-shapes, ignoring other configurations like straight lines or opposites.
 * Process in a single pass over 0 cells, using mutable out grid; order matters as changes affect later checks (top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
 * No diagonal neighbor checks for isolation or basic adjacency—only orthogonal for core logic, but eight directions for some fills.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16), with many empty rows/columns; preserve all 0s unless part of a pattern fill.
 * 7s seem to mark "claimed" or boundary/interior cells without removing them, suggesting annotation rather than erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Conditional fills in open directions only apply to low-adjacency 0s (<2 neighbors) to avoid filling unrelated empty space; also, is_internal check limits open-side fills.
 * No handling for num_1 == 1 or 0 cases explicitly beyond isolation removal.
 * Potential overreach: Code modifies 1s to 7s even if not enclosed, based on local 0-cell views, which can propagate incorrectly in complex shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_neighbor(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, di: int, dj: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    ni = i + di
    nj = j + dj
    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
        return g[ni][nj]
    return 0
```
(This is useful for safe boundary-checked neighbor access, used in isolation and pattern detection.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if get_neighbor(out, i, j, di, dj) == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This correctly removes isolated 1s based on orthogonal neighbors and is likely working well, as no differences noted in isolations across examples.)

The handle_patterns function is partially helpful for enclosure detection but broken in specifics (see below); no extraction of full objects/shapes yet, which might be needed for global context like connected components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements isolated 1 removal, which works as no isolated 1s appear in generated outputs where they shouldn't.
 * Pattern handling partially works for some full enclosures (num_1==4), as seen in training 1 where top-left and bottom shapes have some 7 fills matching expected, but fails on partial opens (num_1==3/2), leading to under/over-filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated has extra 1s in row 11 (positions 5-6 should be 7 and 0 per expected, but are 0 and 0—underfilled); row 12 has 7,1,1 instead of 7,7,7 (underfilled interior); row 13 all 1s except expected has 7s in positions 4-7 (missed horizontal fill); row 14 has extra 7s in positions 7-8 (overfilled where expected is all 1s); bottom shape in rows 16-17 matches expected fills.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrectly fills row 2 with 1s where expected has 1s but misses some 7s (e.g., positions 1-2 should be 1s but code put 7s? Wait, row 2 is [1,7,7,1,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,...]—overfilled early); row 5 has 7,7,0 vs expected 0,0,0 (overfilled sides); row 10 has 1,1,0 vs expected 1,1,0 (matches but later mismatches); row 12 all 1s vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (minor); row 13 has 7,0,0 vs expected 7,7,7,7 (underfilled); overall, code detects some vertical fills but misses horizontal enclosures and overfills bays.
 * Training example 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 3 position 6 with 7 (isolated? but expected 0); row 4 has 1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1 (overfilled); row 7 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7 (mismatch in positions 11-12: 7,0 vs 0,7—shifted fill); row 8 similar shift; row 9 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1 (underfilled position 6); bottom rows match expected fills, suggesting vertical patterns work better than horizontal.
 * No object extraction function present, which might help identify connected 1-components for global enclosure detection instead of local 0-cell checks.
 * The 2-neighbor logic only handles specific L-shapes but misses straight or opposite pairs, leading to underfilling in linear opens (e.g., training 2 row 13 underfill).
 * Single pass mutation causes order-dependent errors, like early fills affecting later num_1 counts (unknown if this caused specific mismatches, but likely in complex shapes).
 * No reversal or iterative passes, so partial fills don't propagate (e.g., training 1 row 12 underfill).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in ways that suggest partial enclosure detection (e.g., vertical fills in columns 4-5 rows 2-12 look like bay handling, horizontal in row 4-5), but it does not look fully correct—many areas seem underfilled or overfilled compared to likely expected (based on training patterns), such as row 5 having 7,7,7,1,... which might overfill an open area, and row 9-10 having scattered 7s in a dense 1 block that expected might keep more as 1s for unprocessed shapes.
 * Missing fills in bottom-left enclosure (rows 10-12, columns 5-7 should likely have more 7s for interior if it's a bay, but has 7,0,7—underfilled like training 3).
 * Overfills in row 2 position 4 with 7 where it might be open (similar to training 2 overfill); right-side 7s in rows 2-10 column 10 seem correct for a separate shape, but without expected, hard to confirm—however, inconsistencies with training suggest it's not handling mixed horizontal/vertical opens well.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates the same flaws as trainings (local over/under-fills), so it likely doesn't match expected; needs better global shape detection to avoid local errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid where 1s represent land or solid structures and 0s represent empty space or water, and the goal is to "clean" the grid by removing invalid or protruding land pixels while identifying and marking enclosed bays, holes, or inland features (surrounded by 3+ sides of land) with 7s to highlight them, preserving borders and certain connected structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has borders that must be preserved (1s on edges shouldn't be removed), and cleaning only applies to internal (non-border) 1s with <=1 neighbor or 2 non-opposite neighbors (e.g., not straight lines like up-down [dirs 0,1] or left-right [2,3]).
 * Bays/holes are 0s surrounded by >=3 land neighbors (using 4-directional for enclosure check, but 8-directional for marking adjacent 1s); for exactly 3 neighbors, detect the single open direction and conditionally fill/mark 1s in that direction if the open cell has <2 land neighbors (simple bay) or handle "double" cases by marking center and far-side extensions.
 * Subtle elements: For 3-neighbor 0s, the open direction must lead to a truly open 0 (not land), and filling is 3-wide strips perpendicular to the direction (e.g., horizontal strip for vertical open); for open_num1==2, mark vertically/horizontally extended far sides (2 steps away, 3-wide). Avoid over-marking—only mark 1s adjacent to the hole/bay. Holes can be multi-cell (e.g., L-shapes or larger enclosures need full filling). Process in passes if needed, but current code does single pass. Border 1s are immune to cleaning/marking changes. Grids can have disconnected components or vertical/horizontal symmetries that require direction-specific logic. Miss easy cases like single-pixel protrusions or diagonal bays. Expected outputs show 7s only on former 1s that form bay walls, not on 0s; 0s remain 0 unless part of a fill (but code marks 1s to 7, not 0s).
 * Considerations across attempts: Direction indexing (dirs4: 0=up,1=down,2=left,3=right) is crucial for opposite checks and filling strips. Use 8-dirs for broad neighbor marking but 4-dirs for enclosure count. Handle vertical vs. horizontal opens separately for far-side marking. Code assumes rectangular grids; no rotation or non-1/0 values. Iterative cleaning/marking may be needed for nested bays, but examples suggest single pass suffices if logic is right. Preserve all original 0s and non-marked 1s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_num_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This 4-dir neighbor count is essential for enclosure detection and cleaning rules.)

```python
def clean_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if new_g[r][c] == 1 and not (r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1):
                one_dirs = []
                for i, (dr, dc) in enumerate(dirs4):
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and new_g[nr][nc] == 1:
                        one_dirs.append(i)
                num1 = len(one_dirs)
                if num1 <= 1 or (num1 == 2 and sorted(one_dirs) not in [[0, 1], [2, 3]]):
                    new_g[r][c] = 0
    return new_g
```
(This partially works for removing invalid internal 1s but may over-remove in complex shapes; useful as a preprocessing step.)

(The `handle_bays_and_holes` function is an attempt at marking but is broken—see below; no extraction functions were provided, but one could be added to identify connected components of 0s for better hole detection, e.g., flood-fill to find enclosed areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt's clean_grid works partially (correctly removes some protrusions in train 1 rows 4-5 and train 2 cols 2-13, preserving borders and straight lines) but fails to remove nothing in train 3 (leading to near-empty output) and over-removes or misses in bays (e.g., train 1 row 3 keeps 1s at cols 7-9 that should stay but get marked later).
 * handle_bays_and_holes correctly identifies some 3+ neighbor 0s and marks adjacent 1s to 7 (e.g., train 1 top bay at row0 col2, row1 cols2-4; train 2 bottom at row13 cols5-8) but misses nested/complex fills: in train 1, fails to mark row3 cols7-9 to 7, row4 cols7-10 to 7/0/7, row5 cols7-9 to 7, and entire lower structure (rows9-13 cols5-7); also incorrectly marks row1 col15-16 as 7s (should be 1s) and leaves row16 col16 as 0 (should be 7? wait, expected has 7 there but generated doesn't).
 * In train 2, misses filling inner land-like structure (rows5-9 cols6-11 should be partial 1s turning to 7s, but generated leaves as 0s or partial 7s only at edges like row5 col13-15); incorrectly marks row0 col15 as 0 (expected 7) and row8 col15 as 0 (expected 7), and row9 col15 as 7 but adjacent wrong.
 * Train 3 is a total failure: generated almost all 0s (only row4 col15=1), missing the entire vertical structure (rows4-13 cols4-15 with 7s in bays like row5 col9-11, row6 col11, etc.); likely because cleaning removes the thin structure incorrectly or hole detection skips due to border proximity/openness.
 * No object extraction function was attempted, which would help identify connected 0-components for true enclosures (e.g., flood-fill from borders to distinguish inland holes); current neighbor-based detection misses multi-cell bays.
 * The 3-neighbor open direction logic works for simple cases (e.g., train 1 top) but breaks on open_num1==2 (far-side marking doesn't trigger properly, e.g., train 2 inner) and doesn't handle len(open_dirs)>1 or diagonal opens.
 * Single-pass processing misses iterative needs, like marking one bay exposing another.
 * Function `handle_bays_and_holes` is broken for complex/nested cases and over-marks borders (don't use as-is; needs refinement for open_dir filling strips and far-side logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially captures cleaning (removes protrusions in rows0-2 cols5-15 and row11-15 cols5-15 correctly as 0s) and some bay marking (e.g., row7 cols11-13=7s for a small enclosure, row8-10 cols10-12=7/0/7 pattern), but it does not look fully correct: misses marking larger bays like row5 col5-6 should lead to filling row6 col4? (hard to tell without expected, but based on patterns, likely needs 7s around row6-7 cols3-5 enclosure and row4 col13-15); incorrectly leaves row7 col15=0 (probably should be 1 or 7 if bay wall) and row9 col13=7 but adjacent row8 col13=1 (inconsistent with expected bay fills); the bottom structure row15 col15=1 is preserved but may need 7s if it's a bay wall. Overall, it under-marks enclosures (e.g., the L-shape at rows6-10 cols3-13 likely needs more 7s in the inner corner) and fails to handle the test's vertical thin connections similar to train 3's failure. This suggests the code detects simple 3-sided bays but misses multi-cell or directionally complex ones, making the output incomplete.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based shape processing, where the goal is to identify and mark (with 7) or remove (to 0) specific structural elements like thin protrusions, low-connectivity cells, or boundary configurations in binary shapes made of 1s, while preserving the core body of objects. The output grid modifies the input by highlighting removable or noise-like parts (7s) and sometimes erasing them, likely to isolate main shapes or clean up artifacts in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are composed of 1s on a 0 background; 7s seem to indicate cells targeted for removal or highlighting, often in thin arms, corners, or isolated extensions, but not the solid core.
 * Low-connectivity removal: Cells with 0 or 1 adjacent 1 (in 4 directions) should be removed early to prune isolated points or tips.
 * Thin protrusions: Cells surrounded by >=3 non-1s (edges or 0s) in 4 directions are likely noise and should be set to 0, but this must happen after initial marking to avoid over-removal.
 * Boundary scanning from 0 cells: Analyze adjacent 1s from empty spaces; configurations like single adjacent 1 (e.g., vertical chains of exactly 3 empty above a rightward protrusion) or 2-3 adjacent 1s (opposites for lines, L-shapes, or corners) trigger marking of nearby 1s to 7, but skip if the open side leads to a high-connectivity empty cell (e.g., >=2 or ==3 neighbors).
 * Directional exclusions: For horizontal/vertical lines or corners, exclude marking upward if the open side is rightward to avoid over-marking vertical extensions.
 * 8-adjacency marking: When marking from L or corner configs, use 8 directions but sometimes exclude up; this catches diagonal protrusions but risks over-marking if not conditioned on openness.
 * Second pass: After thin removal, re-scan for remaining 1s adjacent via single direction (non-up/down) and mark the adjacent 1 to 7 if it's a lingering tip.
 * Subtleties: Horizontal vs. vertical handling differs (e.g., mark 3 cells right for horizontals, down for verticals); chain lengths matter (e.g., exactly 3 empty above for specific protrusions); avoid marking solid bodies (e.g., skip if open side has >1 neighbor 1s); empty rows/columns separate objects, and processing must not bleed across them.
 * Over-removal risk: Functions like remove_low_connect can erase valid cores if applied too early; thin removal after marking helps, but mis-marking leads to chain reactions.
 * Under-marking: Complex shapes with internal 0s or diagonals may miss L/corner detections if neighbor counts aren't 8-way in some checks.
 * Grid boundaries: Always check bounds to avoid index errors, treating out-of-bounds as 0 (non-1).

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; grids are List[List[int]]. These functions are mostly helpful but need integration tweaks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a multi-pass approach (low-connect removal, config-based marking from 0s, thin protrusion removal, second marking) which partially captures boundary detection but fails on specifics like chain lengths and directional marking.
 * Worked: Basic pruning of low-connect and thin parts; 4/8-dir neighbor logic identifies some L/corners and opposites for lines; marking some protrusions to 7 in simple cases (e.g., rightward arms in Train 1).
 * Didn't work: Over-marking solid areas (e.g., in Train 1 row 5, generated sets [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] but expected keeps more 1s like [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] with differences in later rows; unknown why row 1 col 16 is 1 in generated vs 7 expected). In Train 1, row 6 has all 0s generated but expected [0s with 7s in cols 7-9]; this suggests thin removal erased marked areas prematurely or marking missed a horizontal extension.
 * Train 2: Generated marks too many 7s early (e.g., row 2 [1,7,7,7,1,...] vs expected all 1s [1,1,1,1,1,...]), over-pruning a solid top bar; row 5 has [1,7,0,0,...] but expected [1,1,0,0,...] with later 1s turned to 7s—missed shifting marking down for vertical parts; row 13 generated [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,...] but expected same with more 7s in cols 6-8, indicating under-marking of a bottom protrusion.
 * Train 3: Major failure—generated marks internal parts of a single shape (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,...] but expected [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,...] with 7s only in specific cols 9-11; row 7 [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7,0,...] vs expected similar but 7s in cols 9-11 and 13; row 13 all 0s generated vs expected [0s,7s in cols 6-8]). This shows over-marking of core (e.g., treating inner Ls as protrusions) and missing preservation of main body; thin removal likely wiped marked but connected areas.
 * Config detection bugs: Num==1 only handles rightward with exact 3-up chain, missing other singles; num==2 opposites mark inconsistently (e.g., vertical marks down 3 but not always adjacent); num==3 skips if open empty has ==3 neighbors, but may false-positive on diagonals; L-shape skip condition (both opens empty with <=1 neighbor) is too strict, leading to under-marking.
 * No object extraction function; all processing is global scan, which works for separated shapes but fails on interconnected ones without per-object isolation.
 * The second marking pass is underused—only catches single-dir tips but misses after thin removal changes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it marks excessive 7s in what seems a complex shape with arms (e.g., rows 4-9 show heavy 7-marking in cols 10-14 like [7,0,7,7,0] in row 4, but based on patterns from training, cores should preserve more 1s—e.g., expected might keep row 4 as more 1s with targeted 7s only on tips, similar to Train 1's partial matches).
 * Top rows 0-2 all 1s preserved (good, likely solid bar), but row 3 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7,0,0] marks a right protrusion to 7/0, which may be correct if thin, but row 5 [1,1,1,7,7,0,7,1,...] inserts 0s and 7s oddly—likely over-removal of a diagonal or bend, unlike expected clean marking in similar Train 3 bends.
 * Bottom rows 10-15 show under-marking (e.g., row 11 [1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] has isolated 0/7, but training suggests vertical extensions should mark down 3 consistently without gaps); row 12 all low 1s then 0s may miss a bottom arm.
 * Overall, it partially prunes but creates fragmented 7/0 patterns that don't align with training expectations of targeted tip-marking without core erosion; unclear why cols 11-12 have many 0s (perhaps thin removal over-applied post-marking), but it looks noisy rather than clean.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary image processing on a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/objects), where the goal is to clean up noise by removing small connected components of 1s, identify and fill small enclosed holes (internal 0-regions not connected to the border background) by dilating their boundaries to 7s, and handle isolated border 0s similarly as small holes. The output modifies the original grid: small 1-components become 0s, small holes get dilated boundaries marked as 7s (while keeping hole interiors as 0s), and larger structures remain intact.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), not diagonal.
 * Background 0s are all 0-regions reachable from the grid borders via flood-fill; any internal 0s not reachable are enclosed holes.
 * Small 1-components are defined as size <2 (single isolated 1s), which get set to 0; larger 1-groups (size >=2) are preserved as objects.
 * Small holes are enclosed 0-components of size <=3, plus any single isolated 0s on the border; these are not filled entirely but dilated: surrounding pixels (3x3 neighborhood, excluding the hole itself) are set to 7 to "highlight" or expand the boundary.
 * Dilation for holes only affects non-hole pixels (e.g., 1s become 7s); hole pixels stay 0.
 * Border single 0s are treated as small holes even if connected to background, but only if truly isolated (no adjacent 0s).
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects, varying sizes, and holes of different scales; larger holes (>3) are left as 0s without dilation.
 * Bottom rows or edges may have partial structures or all-0 lines that should not be altered unless they qualify as small components/holes.
 * Subtle: In get_background_positions, ensure flood-fill starts only from border 0s and marks all reachable 0s; enclosed 0s are the complement.
 * Subtle: In dilation, the 3x3 kernel around each small hole pixel should union across the component, but avoid overwriting hole 0s.
 * Subtle: After removing small 1s, re-evaluate holes on the original grid (not the cleaned one) to avoid altering hole detection.
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s that are single but adjacent to 1s might need special handling; also, holes touching borders aren't enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: In get_zero_components, it operates only on enclosed set, but assumes enclosed positions are valid; rows/cols inferred from max coords may fail if enclosed is empty.
 * Consideration: Outputs use 7 for dilated boundaries, 0 for holes/interiors/background, 1 for preserved objects; no other values.
 * All processing should preserve grid dimensions and non-qualifying pixels unchanged.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it implements core logic for small 1-removal and small hole dilation but fails all training examples due to incorrect hole identification and dilation placement.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly dilates some areas (e.g., row 3 col 7-9 missing 7s, row 4 col 7=0 but expected 7, row 5 col 7-9=7 but expected 0 in hole? Wait, differences in hole dilation: generated has extra 7s in row 16-17 and misses 7s in row 12 col 7, row 16 col 13-15=0 but expected 7s; also row 4 col 16=7 expected 7 but surrounding mismatch; unknown why dilation skips some boundaries.
 * Train 2: Generated adds unwanted 7s (e.g., row 8 col 13=1 but expected 1? Wait, row 8 col 13=0 expected 0, but row 9 col 13=1 expected 1, main issue: misses dilation in row 6 col 13-15=7 expected 7 but row 9 col 13=1 instead of expected 1? Differences: generated has row 6 col 13=0 but expected 7? No, row 6: generated [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] vs expected [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] - match? Wait, actual diff in row 15? Generated misses some 7s in lower parts; unknown, but border handling wrong as row 0 col 14=7 expected 7 but propagation fails.
 * Train 3: Generated incorrectly removes a small 1 in row 3 col 6=1 (sets to 0, but expected preserved? No, expected row 3 all 0s, but generated has it; main: misses dilation entirely in lower object (rows 11-13 expected 7s around hole at row 12 col 7=0, but generated has no 7s there, keeps all 1s; also row 13 col 6=0 expected 0 but no dilation; upper hole dilation partial, e.g., row 5 col 9-11=7 expected 7 but row 7 col 11=0 expected 0 match, but lower fails completely.
 * remove_small_components works for isolating noise but applied too early, before hole detection on original.
 * get_background_positions seems correct but may miss if borders have 1s blocking.
 * get_border_single_zeros is broken/not helpful: it checks isolation but enqueues only borders and marks visited prematurely, leading to missing some singles; also overlaps with background flood-fill, causing double-counting or skips.
 * dilate_small_holes is partially helpful but flawed: it unions 3x3 around holes and sets non-hole to 7, but in examples, it over-dilates (e.g., Train 1 row 1 col 3-4=7 expected 7 match but extends wrongly) or under-dilates (Train 3 lower hole untouched); doesn't exclude background 0s properly, and to_change includes holes themselves sometimes.
 * get_zero_components helpful but assumes enclosed from original grid; in program, enclosed computed on original g, good, but rows/cols from max may be inaccurate if grid larger.
 * Overall: Program structure good (clean 1s first, find holes on original, dilate), but border singles mishandled, dilation kernel applies to wrong pixels (e.g., sets some 0s to 7 incorrectly), and small hole threshold <=3 includes border singles but logic buggy.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies dilation to what seems a large internal hole (rows 4-10, cols 4-10 area with 0s turned to 7 boundaries), but over-dilates into the left 1-structure (e.g., row 4 col 4=7 but likely should be 1 if part of large object) and misses potential small holes elsewhere (e.g., row 11 col 6=0 isolated? but no 7 around it; also right side row 4 col 12=1 expected preserved but if small, removed? Unknown without expected, but looks like it treats a medium hole as small, adding 7s in row 7 col 3=0? Wait, generated has 7s in unexpected places like row 7 col 11=7 but may be overreach; bottom all-0 rows unchanged good, but upper left 1s dilated wrongly into 7s at row 4 col 4-6. It makes partial sense for one hole but ignores object connectivity, leading to broken shapes.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0 for empty, 1 for filled shapes) where the goal is to detect "cores" (internal holes or enclosed 0s with sufficient surrounding 1s), remove thin or protruding parts of shapes that are not structurally significant, and highlight boundary or adjacent areas around cores with 7 (likely representing dark red outlining or emphasis) while preserving the overall shape integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Cores are strictly defined as 0 cells with at least 3 orthogonal (up/down/left/right) 1 neighbors; diagonal neighbors do not count, and cores must be internal voids, not edge or open spaces.
 * Thin protrusions are 1 cells with fewer than 2 orthogonal 1 neighbors; these should be removed (set to 0) to simplify shapes, but only after core detection, and removals should not override core-adjacent highlighting.
 * Highlighting with 7 occurs around cores using 8-directional neighbors (including diagonals), but skips other cores and prioritizes setting 1s or low-connectivity 0s to 7; however, this must integrate with protrusion removal—e.g., a thin protrusion near a core might stay as 1 or get set to 7 instead of 0.
 * Subtlety: Highlighting applies to the original grid, but final output overrides thin removals only if not already set to 7, which can lead to incomplete outlining if thin parts are not reconsidered post-highlighting.
 * Grids have varying sizes but consistent structure (e.g., multiple disconnected shapes or "objects"); processing must handle all independently without assuming connectivity.
 * 7s form outlines or "dark red" borders around holes/cores, but only on non-core cells; avoid setting cores themselves or isolated 0s to 7 unless they meet low-connectivity criteria.
 * Easy to miss: Orthogonal-only for core detection and protrusion removal, but 8-directional for highlighting spread; also, protrusion removal uses the original grid, not an iterative process, which can miss chained thins.
 * Integration order matters: Detect cores first on original, remove thins separately, then apply highlighting, and finally reconcile (e.g., keep thin removals as 0 unless highlighting sets to 7).
 * No changes to existing 0s unless they are near cores and low-connectivity; shapes should remain mostly 1s except for removals and highlights.
 * Potential for multiple cores per shape; highlighting must not overlap destructively or fill holes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from copy import deepcopy

def num_ortho_ones(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    directions: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni = i + di
        nj = j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is helpful for core detection and protrusion checks, as it correctly counts only orthogonal 1 neighbors.)

```python
def identify_cores(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return set()
    cols = len(grid[0])
    cores: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) >= 3:
                cores.add((i, j))
    return cores
```
(This accurately identifies core positions and is essential for targeting highlighting.)

```python
def remove_thin_protrusions(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(grid[0])
    out = deepcopy(grid)
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) < 2:
                out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This is useful for simplifying shapes by removing low-connectivity 1s, but note it is non-iterative and based on original grid.)

```python
def get_neighbor_deltas() -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    deltas: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if di != 0 or dj != 0:
                deltas.append((di, dj))
    return deltas
```
(This provides 8-directional neighbors for highlighting spread around cores, which is key for outlining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly handled training example 3 (full match, demonstrating core detection and basic highlighting/removal work for simple cases), but failed training 1 and 2 due to incomplete 7 highlighting on certain boundary cells.
 * In training 1, generated output mismatches expected at row 12, column 7 (0-based: position (12,7) is 1 in generated but 7 in expected), and possibly others; this suggests highlighting did not propagate to all adjacent non-thin 1s near cores, leaving part of a core outline as 1 instead of 7.
 * In training 2, generated output mismatches expected in the top rows (e.g., row 0 column 14 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected; row 0 column 15 is 0 in generated but nothing shown, but overall top-right area lacks 7s), and row 8 column 13 is 1 in generated but expected has 7 there; this indicates failure to highlight thin or edge areas near cores in the upper shape.
 * The reconciliation step in program() overrides thin removals to 0 only if not 7, but this missed setting some 1s to 7 in original positions that were thin but core-adjacent (e.g., should prioritize 7 over removal in borders).
 * Core detection worked (as seen in correct training 3), but set_dark_red_around_holes is incomplete: it sets 7 on 1s or low-ortho 0s near cores, but skips if ortho_count >=2 for 0s, which may miss subtle hole boundaries; also, it uses original grid but doesn't fully integrate with temp_grid removals.
 * remove_thin_protrusions is helpful but non-iterative, potentially leaving pseudo-thin structures if multiple passes are needed (though not evident in examples).
 * No extraction of full objects/shapes was attempted, which might help for disconnected components, but current per-cell approach works for cores; adding object flooding could isolate shapes but isn't necessary yet.
 * The program assumes uniform grid size per row, which holds, but doesn't handle empty grids gracefully beyond basics.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on rules: it correctly identifies a core-like area in the middle-right (e.g., 7s around what seems a hole at ~row 4-11, col 10-12), removes some left-side thins (many 0s on left), and outlines with 7s in 8 directions, but it looks incorrect overall because the large central shape's hole outlining is inconsistent—e.g., row 5 col 5 is 0 (possible thin removal or hole extension) but adjacent 7s suggest incomplete fill/prevention of hole spillover, and top-left shape has no 7s despite potential internal voids.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have more precise 7 outlining around the evident hole in the bottom-left-ish shape (rows 3-12, cols 0-14), setting 7s on all 8-neighbor borders without leaving isolated 1s inside (e.g., row 7 col 3 is 0 in generated, but if it's a thin near core, it should be 7 or removed consistently); also, right-side protrusions (col 14-15) have scattered 0s that seem over-removed, missing 7 borders.
 * The test output does not fully look correct: It over-applies 0s in thin areas without reconciling to 7 (e.g., row 3 col 13 is 1 but surrounded by 0s, should be removed or highlighted if near core), and the bottom shape (rows 10-12) has 7s that don't close the outline properly, suggesting the highlighting function missed some deltas or low-connectivity checks.
 * To handle test case, need to ensure highlighting scans all core neighbors post-removal and sets 7 on any remaining 1s or adjacent 0s <2 ortho, avoiding the generated's patchy borders.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties
Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following components and properties are identified. Only those with obvious, direct interactions or effects that are consistent across **every** train example are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., empty spaces, which show no consistent interaction with colors, shapes, or transformations) are excluded. Inconsistent or forced connections (e.g., exact pixel matching between specific regions or semantic meanings like "movement direction") are not included. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly explained from the data, it is noted as unknown.

#### Components
- **Blue regions**: Present in both input and output. Defined by properties: bounding box (bbox for position), hole count (holes, integer ≥0 indicating enclosed empty areas), and pixel count (pixels, area measure). Serve as base structures; multiple per example, varying in size (small: ~1 pixel; large: 30+ pixels).
- **Dark Red regions**: Present only in output. Defined by the same properties as Blue (bbox, holes, pixels). Act as new or modified elements overlaid on or replacing parts of input Blue regions.

#### Interactions and Effects (Consistent Across All Train Examples)
These describe how properties of one component affect or connect to another, or how they transform. Only pairwise or direct effects that hold in every train pair are listed.

1. **Spatial position (bbox) of input Blue regions → position (bbox) of output Dark Red regions**  
   - Effect: Every Dark Red bbox is fully contained within or directly overlaps an input Blue bbox (no Dark Red appears outside input Blue spatial extents). This indicates positional dependency, where output Dark Red is constrained to input Blue locations.  
   - Consistency: Observed in all examples (e.g., Train 1: all 5 Dark Red within input [0,0,16,4] or [0,9,16,14]; Train 2: all 4 Dark Red within [0,0,15,15]; Train 3: both Dark Red within [4,3,13,12]).  
   - No further transformation (e.g., exact shift or scaling) is explainable from data—called unknown.

2. **Pixel count (pixels) of input Blue regions → pixel count (pixels) of output Blue + Dark Red regions**  
   - Effect: Total input Blue pixels ≈ total output (Blue pixels + Dark Red pixels), with minor variance (≤1-2 pixels, likely due to edge/rounding). This shows direct pixel-level transformation, where portions of input Blue pixels are converted to Dark Red pixels without net loss or gain. Individual input Blue regions lose pixels (output Blue < input Blue where matched by bbox overlap), with losses matching nearby Dark Red gains.  
   - Consistency: Exact or near-exact conservation in all examples (e.g., Train 1: 200 input → 203 output; Train 2: 194 → 192; Train 3: 90 → 90). Indicates pixels as a conserved property across color change.  
   - Selection of which specific pixels transform (e.g., based on edges or silhouettes) is unknown.

3. **Hole count (holes >0) in input Blue regions → hole count (holes >0) in output Dark Red regions (spatially linked)**  
   - Effect: Every input Blue with holes >0 has at least one output Dark Red with holes >0 positioned within its bbox (via interaction 1). This suggests input holes influence the creation of holed Dark Red in the same area, potentially by "inheriting" or propagating hole properties during transformation. Input regions with holes=0 may or may not produce holed Dark Red (inconsistent).  
   - Consistency: Holds in all examples where input holes >0 exist (e.g., Train 1: input holes=1 → 3 holed Dark Red, one directly in the holed Blue's bbox; Train 2: input holes=4 → 3 holed Dark Red in holed Blues' bboxes; Train 3: input holes=2 → 2 holed Dark Red in the holed Blue's bbox). Total hole counts are not conserved (e.g., can increase).  
   - Exact mechanism (e.g., hole count matching or hole position affecting Dark Red shape) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., color directly affecting movement, small Blue pixel counts → specific Dark Red shapes, or bbox dimensions → hole changes) are obvious from the data. Test inputs are not analyzed, as instructions limit to train examples for identification.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:11:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a binary grid (0s as empty/open spaces, 1s as filled/structural elements) to identify and mark specific patterns like isolated cells, enclosed areas, bays (single/double horizontal/vertical), L-shapes, and edge straights by changing qualifying 1s to 7s (likely indicating "filled" or "boundary" cells), while leaving others as 1 or 0. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected markings for training cases, suggesting rules for detecting connected components, neighbor counts, and directional openness in a maze-like or shape-filling context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules involve neighbor counting in 4 directions (up, down, left, right); 1s with 0 neighbors are isolated and removed (set to 0), while 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) trigger marking adjacent 1s as 7s to "fill" enclosures.
 * Bays are key patterns: single bays (0 with exactly 3 one-neighbors, indicating one open direction) mark the 3 closing 1s as 7s plus specific diagonals; double bays (two adjacent 0s each with 3 one-neighbors) mark sides and sometimes fill centers or extensions, but only if not part of larger opens (e.g., skip if open side leads to another 3-neighbor 0 or straight-line extension).
 * L-bays (0 with exactly 2 non-opposite one-neighbors) mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal between them as 7s; opposites (horizontal or vertical straights) are skipped to avoid false positives.
 * Edge straights handle boundary cases: horizontal 0s on top/bottom with only left/right 1s (no up/down) mark those sides as 7s; vertical on sides mark up/down 1s.
 * Subtleties include directionality (e.g., open direction in single bays determines which diagonals to mark: up/down opens fill horizontal diagonals below/above; left/right fill vertical diagonals right/left); avoiding over-marking by checking if open cell is another bay or straight (e.g., skip single bay if open neighbor has 3 ones or is a horizontal/vertical extension); sequence matters (e.g., remove isolated first, then enclosures, then bays to prevent interference).
 * Vertical double bays require explicit checks for open left/right (e.g., both 0s open right means left/top/bottom 1s marked, right centers filled unless edge); symmetric for left.
 * Easy misses: not skipping overlapping patterns (e.g., double horizontal bay skips by +2 cols to avoid double-count); handling edges/boundaries (no wrap-around, out-of-bounds treated as non-1); potential over-filling in non-edge centers (set to 7 unless bottom/top row); diagonals only in specific bay types, not all; isolated removal happens before marking to clean grid but uses original g for counts.
 * General: Grid sizes vary (e.g., 17x19, 16x16, 16x16); outputs preserve 0s and change only 1s to 7s (no 1 to 0 except isolated); patterns may nest or chain, so order (enclosed > doubles > edges > L > single) is crucial; no rotation/symmetry assumed beyond explicit vertical/horizontal handlers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Useful for consistent 4-dir neighbor checks
opposites = [(0, 1), (2, 3)]  # Indices for horizontal (0=up,1=down) and vertical (2=left,3=right) opposites to skip straights

def count_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count  # Essential for bay/enclosure detection; used across all handlers
```

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Copies grid and sets isolated 1s (0 neighbors) to 0; applies early to clean before pattern detection
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1 and count_one_neighbors(g, i, j) == 0:
                result[i][j] = 0
    return result  # Helpful for initial cleanup, but ensure it doesn't remove parts of valid patterns
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) partially understands core rules like neighbor counting, isolation removal, and bay detection but fails all training examples due to bugs in pattern skipping, over-marking, and sequence.
 * Worked: remove_isolated correctly cleans stray 1s (e.g., no extras in empty areas); count_one_neighbors is accurate and reusable; basic enclosure marking (handle_enclosed) identifies 4-neighbor 0s but over-marks adjacent 1s without boundary checks.
 * Didn't work: handle_double_horizontal_bays over-marks or misses skips (e.g., in Train1 row1 cols3-4: generates 7s where expected has 0/7 mix; Train2 incorrectly marks inner bays as 7s instead of leaving as 1/0); c +=2 skip is good but condition (num_left==3 and num_right==3) triggers falsely without full config check (e.g., doesn't verify open side).
 * handle_double_vertical_bays is broken: r +=1 skip is inside col loop but affects outer r loop incorrectly (off-by-one overlaps); checks for open right/left are too rigid (e.g., Train1 doesn't trigger properly, leaving bottom bays unmarked); center_val logic sets to 0 only on absolute edge but ignores if it's a "fill" case.
 * handle_edge_straights partially works for horizontals (marks sides on top/bottom) but verticals fail boundary logic (e.g., left_one/right_one always False on edges, but condition requires not left_one etc., causing no marks); up_one/down_one mishandle r==0/rows-1 as False correctly but not applied symmetrically.
 * handle_L_bays misses non-edge cases and over-marks diagonals (e.g., Train3 row5 col9-11: generates extra 7s in what should be straight 1s); sorted(one_dirs) and opposites check is good but doesn't handle chained Ls.
 * handle_single_bays is most buggy: skip logic for open cell (if 3 neighbors or straight extension) is incomplete (e.g., Train1 row10 col6: marks 0s as 7 where expected has 0s, failing vertical open check); diagonal marking is direction-specific but errors in indices (e.g., open_i==1 marks upper diagonals correctly but overfills horizontals); additional fill for open 0 extends wrongly (e.g., fills 3-wide but ignores if open leads to edge).
 * Overall: Sequence (doubles before singles) causes over-marking in nested bays; no iteration/refinement loop, so one-pass misses propagations; Train1 diffs: row10 col5-7 all 7s (gen) vs 7,0,7/7,0,0,7 (exp, under-marked centers); row13 all 1s (gen) vs mixed 7s (exp, missed bay); Train2 diffs: row2 all 1s (gen) vs mixed (exp, missed upper structure); row3 col1-2 7,0 (gen) vs 1,0 (exp, over-marked); row6 col13-15 0,7,0 (gen) vs 0,7,7 (exp, under); Train3 diffs: row4 col4-7 1,7,7,7 (gen) vs all 1s (exp, over-marked premature bay); row12 col6-8 7,7,7 (gen) vs 7,0,7 (exp, filled center wrongly).
 * No object extraction function attempted, but patterns suggest needing one for connected 1-components (e.g., to validate bay openness globally); current funcs are local and miss global shape constraints.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: handle_double_vertical_bays (symmetric but loop-buggy, over-constrains configs like requiring r-1 and r+2 always 1); additional fill in single_bays (extends to 0s but sets result[...]=7 even if original 0, but puzzle preserves 0s—wait, code checks if result==1 before set, but for open 0 it sets without check, wrongly filling empties).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-marks many interior 1s as 7s (e.g., rows 3-5 cols10-12 all 7s, suggesting false double bay trigger) and under-marks edges (e.g., row2 col4=7 but adjacent 0s not handled as single bay properly, leaving potential L unmarked); compared to visual intuition, the left structure looks like a bay/opening needing selective 7s on boundaries only, but output fills too much (e.g., row6 col3=7 where it might be straight 1); right side row2 cols10-12=7,7,7 seems like enclosure but test has irregular 0s that should skip per rules; overall, it resembles over-aggressive bay detection without proper skip for chains/extensions, making the output too "filled" vs. expected sparse markings—likely fails if test expects similar to Train1's mixed 0/7 in bays.

- **Black shapes**: Solid black squares, rectangles, and L-shaped polyominoes (e.g., single blocks, 2x1 bars, corner pieces) positioned variably across grids, often forming sparse, asymmetric arrangements or borders in input; retained and integrated into layered structures in output.
- **Purple shapes**: Introduced in output as outlined or filled squares and rectangles (e.g., small dots, larger frames), overlaying or adjacent to black elements, creating composite forms like bordered L-shapes or clustered blocks.
- **Small accents**: Tiny isolated squares or dots in black, purple, or blue, appearing as connectors, fillers, or highlights within larger shapes or empty spaces, enhancing complexity in output.
- **Grid structure**: Implicit 5x5 or similar modular grid layout with horizontal striping (alternating blue and black bands), where elements align to cells; input shows simpler black-on-blue sparsity, output adds purple layering for depth and transformation.
- **Symmetry/Asymmetry**: Mostly asymmetric placements with occasional mirroring (e.g., top-bottom or left-right echoes), evolving from basic input configurations to more intricate, rule-based evolutions in output.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 15:11:53] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), I analyzed for obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements that appear in **every** train pair (1, 2, and 3). Only properties with clear, repeatable links across all examples are included—e.g., direct mappings like position influencing placement, hole counts affecting similar properties in outputs, or pixel changes due to overlay. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel blues that do not reliably map across all, or background bands without specific interactions) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forcing of unclear links is attempted. Where a transformation cannot be clearly explained as consistent, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Blue Component Bounding Box (Position) → Dark Red Component Bounding Box (Position)**
   - **Description**: In every train pair, output Dark Red components are positioned within or directly adjacent to the bounding boxes (bbox) of input Blue components that have holes > 0. This creates a spatial interaction where input positions constrain or "anchor" output placements.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input Blue with holes=1 (bbox [0,9,16,14]) links to output Dark Red at [4,9,7,12] (fully within) and partially to [7,3,9,5] (adjacent y-overlap with nearby band).
     - Train 2: Input Blue with holes=1 (bbox [6,5,11,9]) links to output Dark Red at [7,6,9,8] (within) and [13,5,15,9] (adjacent right extension); input Blue with holes=3 (bbox [0,0,15,15]) links to [14,0,15,1] (top within), [5,12,8,14] (bottom within).
     - Train 3: Input Blue with holes=2 (bbox [4,3,13,12]) links to output Dark Red at [9,5,12,8] (fully within) and [6,11,8,13] (within, y-overlap).
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional anchoring/transformation. No unexplained gaps; all Dark Red placements trace to at least one input Blue bbox with holes > 0.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Exact offset rules (e.g., why some are centered vs. adjacent) cannot be consistently explained without further data.

#### 2. **Input Blue Pixel Count → Output Blue Pixel Count (in Corresponding Bbox)**
   - **Description**: In every train pair, Blue components in output that share overlapping or identical bboxes with input Blue components (especially those with holes > 0) have strictly reduced pixel counts. This indicates a consistent overlay interaction where new elements (Dark Red) displace blue pixels without adding new blue area.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input top Blue (82 pixels, [0,0,16,4]) → output 67 pixels (reduction of 15); middle (83 pixels, [0,9,16,14]) → 70 pixels (reduction of 13); bottom (33 pixels, [0,17,16,18]) → 28 pixels total across split components (reduction of 5).
     - Train 2: Input mid Blue (29 pixels, [6,5,11,9]) → 21 pixels (reduction of 8); large (164 pixels, [0,0,15,15]) → 139 pixels (reduction of 25).
     - Train 3: Input main Blue (88 pixels, [4,3,13,12]) → 70 pixels (reduction of 18, with adjusted bbox [4,4,13,12]).
   - **Interaction Type**: Displacement/overlay. Reductions are always positive and occur only in blues with matching positional ties; total blue pixels decrease globally in each pair.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: The exact amount of reduction (e.g., tied to Dark Red pixel count?) is consistent in direction but not in a formulaic ratio across all.

#### 3. **Input Blue Hole Count → Output Dark Red Hole Count (in Linked Positions)**
   - **Description**: Input Blue components with holes > 0 consistently result in output Dark Red components (in linked positions per #1) that have hole counts of 1 or more, often mirroring or partitioning the input hole count. This suggests holes "transfer" or evolve into Dark Red structures.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input holes=1 (in [0,9,16,14]) → output Dark Red with holes=1 (e.g., [4,9,7,12]) in linked position.
     - Train 2: Input holes=1 (in [6,5,11,9]) → output Dark Red with holes=1 (e.g., [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8]); input holes=3 (in [0,0,15,15]) → three output Dark Red each with holes=1 (total holes=3, partitioned).
     - Train 3: Input holes=2 (in [4,3,13,12]) → output Dark Red with holes=2 ([9,5,12,8]) and holes=1 ([6,11,8,13]) in linked positions (total holes=3, but core link preserves multi-hole structure).
   - **Interaction Type**: Hole transfer/partitioning. Total output Dark Red holes are always ≥ input holes in linked components, with at least one Dark Red inheriting a non-zero hole count.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Partitioning logic (e.g., why holes=3 splits into three 1's in Train 2 but holes=2 stays partially intact in Train 3) cannot be consistently explained; appears context-dependent on component size or position.

#### 4. **Input Blue Hole Count → Output Blue Hole Count (in Corresponding Bbox)**
   - **Description**: Blue components in output that overlap input Blue bboxes with holes > 0 consistently have equal or reduced hole counts, indicating holes are "absorbed" or resolved by interacting elements (e.g., Dark Red overlays).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input holes=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → output holes=0 ([0,9,16,13], reduced).
     - Train 2: Input holes=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → output holes=1 (same, preserved); input holes=3 ([0,0,15,15]) → output holes=1 (reduced).
     - Train 3: Input holes=2 ([4,3,13,12]) → output holes=1 (reduced).
   - **Interaction Type**: Hole absorption/reduction. Never increases; occurs only in positionally linked blues.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Preservation vs. reduction trigger (e.g., why holes=1 stays 1 in Train 2 but reduces in Train 1) is not consistently explainable.

#### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **Components Involved**: Only Blue (input/output) and Dark Red (output) show interactions; no consistent links to other elements (e.g., small accents or grid lines do not reliably interact across all).
- **Non-Interactions Excluded**: Input single-pixel Blues (pixels=1, holes=0) disappear or fragment in outputs but do not consistently map to specific Dark Red properties or positions across all trains (e.g., variable influence on edges in Train 1 vs. Train 3), so omitted. Background bands provide canvas but no direct effects. Symmetry/asymmetry varies and is not a consistent driver.
- **Test Inputs**: Not analyzed for interactions, as they lack outputs; patterns above are train-only for consistency validation.
- **Unknown Transformations Overall**: Broader rules (e.g., why Dark Red pixel counts vary like 5-12, or color shift from implied black to Dark Red) cannot be explained consistently without solving the puzzle; these appear tied to shape properties (e.g., edges/silhouettes) not fully captured in the data.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 15:12:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled cells) through morphological-like operations: removing "thin protrusions" (isolated or barely connected 1s), removing fully isolated 1s, and then highlighting (coloring to 7) any remaining 1s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to small connected components of 0s (size 1 or 2, using 4-connectivity for zeros but 8-connectivity for adjacency checks). The goal is likely to clean up noise in a visual pattern or identify boundaries/features around small holes or gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are rectangular lists of lists with consistent dimensions; assume 0s are background/empty, 1s are foreground/object pixels.
 * Connectivity for zero components uses 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for BFS/flood fill to find small enclosed or open spaces (size <=2).
 * Adjacency for coloring uses 8 directions (including diagonals) to mark 1s touching these small zero components, but only after prior cleaning steps.
 * Cleaning happens sequentially: first remove thin protrusions (1s with >=3 zero neighbors in 4 directions, indicating tips or spurs), then remove isolated 1s (those with 0 one-neighbors in 4 directions).
 * Subtlety: Cleaning modifies a copy of the grid, but coloring uses the original grid for zero detection (to preserve original small holes) while applying to the cleaned grid.
 * Potential misses: Over-removal if protrusions are checked simultaneously without iteration (single pass may leave remnants); small zero components might be open edges, not just enclosed holes; no handling for larger zero components (they shouldn't trigger coloring); diagonal adjacency is key for "touching" but not for zero connectivity.
 * Edge cases: Border cells have fewer neighbors; multiple small zero components per grid; after cleaning, some 1s might become isolated but aren't re-checked; output should preserve 0s and change only specific 1s to 7 (no other values).
 * General: Single-pass operations avoid infinite loops; use BFS for exact component sizing/collection; visited arrays prevent re-processing.

    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a sequential pipeline (protrusions -> isolated -> coloring), which aligns with cleaning before highlighting, but fails entirely due to a syntax error in color_adjacent_to_small_zeros (incomplete if-block after first BFS attempt, line 61).
 * remove_thin_protrusions and remove_isolated are syntactically correct and likely work for their parts (single-pass neighbor counting in 4 directions), but untested due to overall error.
 * color_adjacent_to_small_zeros correctly identifies the need for BFS on original g for zeros, collection of small components (<=2), and 8-dir adjacency coloring on cleaned grid, but the code is broken (first BFS lacks body/indentation, leading to execution error; second BFS is good but orphaned).
 * No outputs generated for any example, so nothing "worked" in terms of producing grids; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) resulted in identical ERROR messages.
 * The main_program orchestrates steps correctly (temp_g for cleaning, result for coloring), but inherits the syntax issue.
 * No extraction of objects or other helper functions attempted; focus is purely on grid modifications.
 * Subtle issue: Single-pass cleaning might not handle chained dependencies (e.g., removing a protrusion could isolate another 1), but not addressed here.
 * Train examples 1-3 and test all failed identically (no grids output), differing from expected by not executing at all—expected would be modified grids with 0/1/7 values highlighting small-zero-adjacent areas after cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (syntax failure), so it does not make sense or look correct—it produced no grid at all, just a traceback about indentation after an if-statement.
 * Without execution, it can't match any expected cleaned/highlighted grid; for instance, if the test input has thin 1s, isolated points, or small zero gaps, the output should show removals (to 0) and colorings (to 7), but nothing was generated to compare.
 * This indicates the program can't handle the test input (or any input) due to the bug, missing all puzzle effects like protrusion removal or small-zero highlighting.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid of 0s (empty space) and 1s (solid elements, like walls or blobs), where the goal is to process the grid to identify and mark boundaries of enclosed holes, isolated elements, and various "bay" structures (indentations or openings in the 1s) by changing specific boundary 1s to 7s (indicating marked boundaries), while sometimes setting certain 1s to 0s or skipping markings to avoid over-processing nested or adjacent features. The processing must preserve the overall structure but highlight enclosures and bays without marking open or irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero adjacent 1s in 4 directions) by setting them to 0, as they are not part of any meaningful structure.
 * For enclosed holes (0s fully surrounded by 1s in all 4 directions), mark the 8 surrounding 1s (orthogonal and diagonal) as 7s to highlight the boundary, but only if it's a true enclosure—avoid marking if it's part of a larger open area.
 * Handle "double horizontal bays": Pairs of adjacent 0s in the same row, each with exactly 3 adjacent 1s (indicating a narrow horizontal indentation); mark the side walls (left of first 0, right of second 0) in both the bay row and the row below as 7s, and set any 1s in the centers of the row below to 0s to "fill" or open the bay—include a skip (c +=1) to avoid double-processing overlapping bays.
 * For L-bays (0s with exactly 2 orthogonal adjacent 1s that are not opposites, forming an L-shape), mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal 1 between them as 7s, but skip if the two 1s are opposite (straight line, not L).
 * For single bays (0s with exactly 3 orthogonal adjacent 1s, indicating one open direction), mark the 3 closed orthogonal 1s as 7s and the 2 diagonals on the closed side as 7s; include a skip condition if the open-side adjacent cell is a 0 with 3 adjacent 1s (to avoid marking nested bays); add extra filling for vertical opens by marking 3 horizontal cells in the open direction as 7s if that cell is 0.
 * Process in sequence: isolated removal first, then enclosed holes, then double bays, L-bays, single bays—order matters to avoid interfering with prior markings (e.g., don't mark a bay if it's already resolved as an enclosure).
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals are crucial for enclosures and bays but not for adjacency counts (use 4-dir for neighbors, 8-dir for boundaries); avoid over-marking adjacent structures (e.g., shared walls between bays should not all be marked if it breaks the shape); handle edges/boundaries carefully (check bounds); nested or adjacent bays require skips to prevent cascading errors; vertical/horizontal symmetry isn't assumed, so check all orientations; 7s should only replace 1s, never create new 1s or change 0s to 7s directly.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided), considerations include avoiding double-counting in loops (e.g., c +=1 in double bays), distinguishing L from straight openings, and conditional skips for nested features— but execution often over-marks or under-marks due to incomplete pattern matching.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 17x17 for train 1, 16x16 for test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions form a modular pipeline, which is helpful for isolating rules, but several have bugs or incompletenesses (detailed below). No custom types are defined, but grid is consistently List[List[int]].

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Helpful for initial cleanup: counts 4-dir adjacent 1s and sets isolated to 0.
    # Works well in isolation but should run only once at start to avoid re-isolating marked 7s (treat 7 as 1? Current code checks ==1, so 7s are preserved).

No extraction functions provided (e.g., no def extract_objects), but the modular rule functions act as such—useful for debugging individual rules.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, but it fails all trainings due to over-marking boundaries (e.g., marking 1s as 7s where they should remain 1s or become 0s) and missing skips for nested structures.
 * Missed handling vertical double bays (only horizontal implemented, causing asymmetry in train 2 row 12-14 where expected has vertical 7s but generated has horizontals).
 * Over-marked in train 1: row 11 has 7,7,7,7 but expected 7,0,0,7 (likely from double bay not setting centers to 0 correctly or L/single interfering); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7 but expected all 1s (enclosed hole or bay overreach); row 14 has 7 at col 8 but expected 0 (isolated marking error).
 * Train 2 mismatches: row 2 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (L-bay falsely triggered); row 5 has 1,7,7,0 but expected 1,1,0,... (single bay over-marks); row 12 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (double bay misses vertical); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7 but expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7 (under-marks vertical bay).
 * Train 3 mismatches: row 3 has 7 at col 6 but expected 0 (enclosed hole falsely marks non-boundary); row 4 has 1,7,7,7,1 but expected 1,1,1,1,1 (single/L bay over-marks open area).
 * Function handle_double_horizontal_bays is partially helpful but broken for vertical cases and over-sets 0s incorrectly in some nestings (don't rely solely, extend to vertical).
 * Function handle_L_bays is unhelpful or incorrect for non-horizontal Ls and triggers falsely on near-opposites (avoid until rotations added).
 * Function handle_single_bays is essential but broken—skip condition insufficient for all nestings, extra fill only vertical (causes most errors in trains); fix diagonals and add horizontal fills.
 * handle_enclosed_holes is mostly helpful but over-marks shared walls in complex blobs (e.g., train 3 row 4).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and likely correct (no obvious errors), but run early.
 * Overall, pipeline order is good, but functions interfere (e.g., bays after holes mark already-resolved areas).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many 1s as 7s in ways that don't align with training expectations, creating irregular boundaries (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 4 and 7,7,7 at cols 10-12, but looks like an open area that should remain 1s; row 5 has scattered 7s/0s in a blob that expected might keep more 1s per train patterns; row 11 has 7s in row 11 col 4-5 but then 0 at col 6 where it might be a bay center needing 0 but sides not marked right; row 12 has 7,7,0 at cols 4-6, suggesting incomplete double bay handling).
 * Compared to trainings, it misses subtle nestings (e.g., potential vertical bays in cols 6-8 not fully marked/skipped, leading to extra 7s in row 7 col 3=0 but surrounded by 7s); over-marks diagonals inappropriately (e.g., row 8 col 12=0 but adjacent 1s marked 7 where expected might be open).
 * Does not make sense for a cohesive enclosure/bay marking—too many isolated 7s (e.g., row 3 col 13=1 unmarked but should be 7 if bay), and the bottom (rows 12-15) has abrupt 7,0,0 patterns like unresolved double bays; to handle test, need better vertical bay detection and stricter skips, as test seems to have more vertical/nested features than horizontal trainings.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing (0s as background/empty, 1s as foreground/objects) to clean up noise, identify and mark internal boundaries or enclosed "pockets" within connected components of 1s using the value 7, while preserving the overall structure. The goal appears to be morphological-like operations: remove small isolated 1s, then detect and highlight internal edges or fill specific open/near-open holes that are almost enclosed by 1s (e.g., 3-sided pockets), but only in certain orientations or conditions to match subtle enclosure rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune small components first: Remove 1s with fewer than 2 orthogonal (4-dir) neighbors to eliminate noise or isolated pixels/lines, but only apply this before other steps to avoid altering main structures.
 * Internal boundaries (7s): Placed on 1s adjacent (8-dir) to 0s that are "qualifying" (the 0 has >=3 orthogonal 1-neighbors, indicating near-enclosure), but this must be precise—over-marking happens if not checking for full enclosure or specific topologies; avoid marking outer boundaries or open edges.
 * Open pockets filling: For 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (a "pocket" open on one side), fill related areas with 7, but only if the open side is specific (e.g., horizontal for certain cases, or conditional on grid position like below midline); this is orientation-sensitive and may propagate fills horizontally or vertically, but current logic fails on directionality and overfills/underfills.
 * Subtle elements: 7s represent internal/diagonal boundaries or filled holes, but not all holes—only those that are "internal" or "almost closed" (e.g., triply-adjacent 0s); distinguish between fully enclosed 0s (leave as 0) and boundary-adjacent ones; consider grid symmetry/asymmetry (e.g., bottom-heavy fills); process order matters (prune -> fill pockets -> set boundaries) to avoid interfering changes; 8-dir for adjacency checks but 4-dir for neighbor counts; edge cases like diagonal connections, single-pixel holes, or pockets near grid borders; no changes to 0s unless explicitly filling, and 1s only become 7 if internal.
 * Across attempts: No extraction of connected components (e.g., flood-fill to identify blobs) was used, leading to global over-application; missing checks for enclosure topology (e.g., is the 0 part of a larger hole?); propagation in fill_open_pockets is buggy (e.g., only handles vertical opens poorly, ignores horizontal fully); set_internal_boundaries over-marks if not filtering for true internals vs. concavities; prune_small_components works partially but may remove valid small parts if <2 neighbors threshold is too strict for chains.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (varying h/w, but consistent per example); outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving 0s in open areas; test inputs may have asymmetric structures requiring direction-specific rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions show partial understanding but are mostly broken or incomplete—prune_small_components is somewhat helpful for noise removal but applies too broadly (single pass may miss iterative pruning); set_internal_boundaries captures the idea of qualifying 0s but over-applies 7s without topology checks; fill_open_pockets attempts pocket detection but has flawed propagation (e.g., only partial horizontal fill for vertical opens, and arbitrary midline condition); no connected component labeling, which would be essential for isolating objects and checking per-blob enclosures.

                        if open_di == 1 and i >= h // 2:  # Arbitrary, causes errors in upper/lower diffs
                            out[i][j] = 7
    return out
```

No other helpful tools; missing: connected component extraction (e.g., DFS/BFS to label blobs and compute per-blob properties like hole count or boundary type), which would help isolate issues.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) demonstrates partial understanding of noise pruning and internal marking but fails all training examples due to imprecise pocket filling and boundary detection.
 * prune_small_components works for removing isolates but doesn't iteratively prune chains, leading to residual small 1s in some cases (though not the main failure here).
 * set_internal_boundaries over-marks 1s as 7 near any 3+ neighbor 0, causing extra 7s in semi-open areas (e.g., Train1 rows 11-12: generates 7,7,7,7 where expected 7,7,0,7 and 7,0,0,7—fills holes prematurely without checking openness).
 * fill_open_pockets under-detects/under-fills pockets: e.g., Train1 lower structure misses 0s in expected holes (generates solid 7s); Train2 top-right: generates 0 and 1 where expected 7,0 and 7,7 (fails to fill near-edge pocket); Train3 row12: generates 7,7,7 where expected 7,0,7 (overfills a specific internal 0).
 * Order of operations (prune -> fill -> boundaries) is logical but interactions cause errors, like fills altering what boundaries see.
 * No component extraction used, so global rules apply blindly—essential for handling multiple objects separately.
 * Function fill_open_pockets is broken (directional bias, midline hack) and not helpful—avoid or rewrite with better open-side detection.
 * set_internal_boundaries is partially helpful but incorrect for non-fully-enclosed 0s—don't use without enclosure check.
 * Overall, misses subtle topology: e.g., Train1/3 have specific 0s preserved inside near-holes, but attempt fills them; Train2 edge pockets need vertical fills upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in what seem like internal areas of a large blob (e.g., rows 4-11 show 7s in concavities), but it does not look fully correct: overfills some pockets (e.g., row5 col5: 0 where likely should be 7 or preserved based on enclosure, but hard to tell without expected; compares to training patterns, it solidifies areas like row7 col3:0 which may be an open pocket needing partial 7); underfills edges (e.g., row2 col10-12:7,7,7 but if analogous to Train2, might need more/less); structure has asymmetric 7s (e.g., left-heavy in rows 6-8) that may ignore horizontal propagation rules seen in failures. It partially makes sense for a connected blob but mismatches training subtleties (e.g., preserves some 0s incorrectly inside, like row6 col5:0), suggesting same bugs as training—likely incorrect due to over-marking internals without precise openness checks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the input to remove isolated 1s and then identify and mark specific enclosed or patterned regions by changing certain 1s to 7s, likely to highlight boundaries, fills, or shapes like loops, bays, or internal areas. The output preserves the overall structure but annotates detectable features, with 7s indicating processed or filled elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't form part of larger structures.
 * For 0 cells (empty spaces), detect surrounding 1s in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) to identify enclosures: full surround (4 neighbors) fills all eight surrounding cells with 7 if they are 1s; 3 neighbors indicate an open bay, filling closed sides and interior/exterior based on open direction, with conditions for low-adjacency cells; 2 neighbors handle corner-like or L-shaped opens by filling specific adjacent 1s.
 * Subtlety in 3-neighbor case: Interior fill is always 3 cells in the closed direction, but exterior/open-side fill only applies if the open-side cell is internal (0) and has <2 neighbors, or if already 1 (always fill); this prevents overfilling unbounded areas.
 * Subtlety in 2-neighbor case: Only specific diagonal pairs of neighbors (e.g., left+down but not up+right) trigger fills of 3-cell L-shapes, ignoring other configurations like straight lines or opposites.
 * Process in a single pass over 0 cells, using mutable out grid; order matters as changes affect later checks (top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
 * No diagonal neighbor checks for isolation or basic adjacency—only orthogonal for core logic, but eight directions for some fills.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16), with many empty rows/columns; preserve all 0s unless part of a pattern fill.
 * 7s seem to mark "claimed" or boundary/interior cells without removing them, suggesting annotation rather than erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Conditional fills in open directions only apply to low-adjacency 0s (<2 neighbors) to avoid filling unrelated empty space; also, is_internal check limits open-side fills.
 * No handling for num_1 == 1 or 0 cases explicitly beyond isolation removal.
 * Potential overreach: Code modifies 1s to 7s even if not enclosed, based on local 0-cell views, which can propagate incorrectly in complex shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_neighbor(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, di: int, dj: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    ni = i + di
    nj = j + dj
    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
        return g[ni][nj]
    return 0
```
(This is useful for safe boundary-checked neighbor access, used in isolation and pattern detection.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if get_neighbor(out, i, j, di, dj) == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This correctly removes isolated 1s based on orthogonal neighbors and is likely working well, as no differences noted in isolations across examples.)

The handle_patterns function is partially helpful for enclosure detection but broken in specifics (see below); no extraction of full objects/shapes yet, which might be needed for global context like connected components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements isolated 1 removal, which works as no isolated 1s appear in generated outputs where they shouldn't.
 * Pattern handling partially works for some full enclosures (num_1==4), as seen in training 1 where top-left and bottom shapes have some 7 fills matching expected, but fails on partial opens (num_1==3/2), leading to under/over-filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated has extra 1s in row 11 (positions 5-6 should be 7 and 0 per expected, but are 0 and 0—underfilled); row 12 has 7,1,1 instead of 7,7,7 (underfilled interior); row 13 all 1s except expected has 7s in positions 4-7 (missed horizontal fill); row 14 has extra 7s in positions 7-8 (overfilled where expected is all 1s); bottom shape in rows 16-17 matches expected fills.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrectly fills row 2 with 1s where expected has 1s but misses some 7s (e.g., positions 1-2 should be 1s but code put 7s? Wait, row 2 is [1,7,7,1,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,...]—overfilled early); row 5 has 7,7,0 vs expected 0,0,0 (overfilled sides); row 10 has 1,1,0 vs expected 1,1,0 (matches but later mismatches); row 12 all 1s vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (minor); row 13 has 7,0,0 vs expected 7,7,7,7 (underfilled); overall, code detects some vertical fills but misses horizontal enclosures and overfills bays.
 * Training example 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 3 position 6 with 7 (isolated? but expected 0); row 4 has 1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1 (overfilled); row 7 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7 (mismatch in positions 11-12: 7,0 vs 0,7—shifted fill); row 8 similar shift; row 9 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1 (underfilled position 6); bottom rows match expected fills, suggesting vertical patterns work better than horizontal.
 * No object extraction function present, which might help identify connected 1-components for global enclosure detection instead of local 0-cell checks.
 * The 2-neighbor logic only handles specific L-shapes but misses straight or opposite pairs, leading to underfilling in linear opens (e.g., training 2 row 13 underfill).
 * Single pass mutation causes order-dependent errors, like early fills affecting later num_1 counts (unknown if this caused specific mismatches, but likely in complex shapes).
 * No reversal or iterative passes, so partial fills don't propagate (e.g., training 1 row 12 underfill).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in ways that suggest partial enclosure detection (e.g., vertical fills in columns 4-5 rows 2-12 look like bay handling, horizontal in row 4-5), but it does not look fully correct—many areas seem underfilled or overfilled compared to likely expected (based on training patterns), such as row 5 having 7,7,7,1,... which might overfill an open area, and row 9-10 having scattered 7s in a dense 1 block that expected might keep more as 1s for unprocessed shapes.
 * Missing fills in bottom-left enclosure (rows 10-12, columns 5-7 should likely have more 7s for interior if it's a bay, but has 7,0,7—underfilled like training 3).
 * Overfills in row 2 position 4 with 7 where it might be open (similar to training 2 overfill); right-side 7s in rows 2-10 column 10 seem correct for a separate shape, but without expected, hard to confirm—however, inconsistencies with training suggest it's not handling mixed horizontal/vertical opens well.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates the same flaws as trainings (local over/under-fills), so it likely doesn't match expected; needs better global shape detection to avoid local errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid where 1s represent land or solid structures and 0s represent empty space or water, and the goal is to "clean" the grid by removing invalid or protruding land pixels while identifying and marking enclosed bays, holes, or inland features (surrounded by 3+ sides of land) with 7s to highlight them, preserving borders and certain connected structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has borders that must be preserved (1s on edges shouldn't be removed), and cleaning only applies to internal (non-border) 1s with <=1 neighbor or 2 non-opposite neighbors (e.g., not straight lines like up-down [dirs 0,1] or left-right [2,3]).
 * Bays/holes are 0s surrounded by >=3 land neighbors (using 4-directional for enclosure check, but 8-directional for marking adjacent 1s); for exactly 3 neighbors, detect the single open direction and conditionally fill/mark 1s in that direction if the open cell has <2 land neighbors (simple bay) or handle "double" cases by marking center and far-side extensions.
 * Subtle elements: For 3-neighbor 0s, the open direction must lead to a truly open 0 (not land), and filling is 3-wide strips perpendicular to the direction (e.g., horizontal strip for vertical open); for open_num1==2, mark vertically/horizontally extended far sides (2 steps away, 3-wide). Avoid over-marking—only mark 1s adjacent to the hole/bay. Holes can be multi-cell (e.g., L-shapes or larger enclosures need full filling). Process in passes if needed, but current code does single pass. Border 1s are immune to cleaning/marking changes. Grids can have disconnected components or vertical/horizontal symmetries that require direction-specific logic. Miss easy cases like single-pixel protrusions or diagonal bays. Expected outputs show 7s only on former 1s that form bay walls, not on 0s; 0s remain 0 unless part of a fill (but code marks 1s to 7, not 0s).
 * Considerations across attempts: Direction indexing (dirs4: 0=up,1=down,2=left,3=right) is crucial for opposite checks and filling strips. Use 8-dirs for broad neighbor marking but 4-dirs for enclosure count. Handle vertical vs. horizontal opens separately for far-side marking. Code assumes rectangular grids; no rotation or non-1/0 values. Iterative cleaning/marking may be needed for nested bays, but examples suggest single pass suffices if logic is right. Preserve all original 0s and non-marked 1s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_num_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This 4-dir neighbor count is essential for enclosure detection and cleaning rules.)

```python
def clean_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if new_g[r][c] == 1 and not (r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1):
                one_dirs = []
                for i, (dr, dc) in enumerate(dirs4):
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and new_g[nr][nc] == 1:
                        one_dirs.append(i)
                num1 = len(one_dirs)
                if num1 <= 1 or (num1 == 2 and sorted(one_dirs) not in [[0, 1], [2, 3]]):
                    new_g[r][c] = 0
    return new_g
```
(This partially works for removing invalid internal 1s but may over-remove in complex shapes; useful as a preprocessing step.)

(The `handle_bays_and_holes` function is an attempt at marking but is broken—see below; no extraction functions were provided, but one could be added to identify connected components of 0s for better hole detection, e.g., flood-fill to find enclosed areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt's clean_grid works partially (correctly removes some protrusions in train 1 rows 4-5 and train 2 cols 2-13, preserving borders and straight lines) but fails to remove nothing in train 3 (leading to near-empty output) and over-removes or misses in bays (e.g., train 1 row 3 keeps 1s at cols 7-9 that should stay but get marked later).
 * handle_bays_and_holes correctly identifies some 3+ neighbor 0s and marks adjacent 1s to 7 (e.g., train 1 top bay at row0 col2, row1 cols2-4; train 2 bottom at row13 cols5-8) but misses nested/complex fills: in train 1, fails to mark row3 cols7-9 to 7, row4 cols7-10 to 7/0/7, row5 cols7-9 to 7, and entire lower structure (rows9-13 cols5-7); also incorrectly marks row1 col15-16 as 7s (should be 1s) and leaves row16 col16 as 0 (should be 7? wait, expected has 7 there but generated doesn't).
 * In train 2, misses filling inner land-like structure (rows5-9 cols6-11 should be partial 1s turning to 7s, but generated leaves as 0s or partial 7s only at edges like row5 col13-15); incorrectly marks row0 col15 as 0 (expected 7) and row8 col15 as 0 (expected 7), and row9 col15 as 7 but adjacent wrong.
 * Train 3 is a total failure: generated almost all 0s (only row4 col15=1), missing the entire vertical structure (rows4-13 cols4-15 with 7s in bays like row5 col9-11, row6 col11, etc.); likely because cleaning removes the thin structure incorrectly or hole detection skips due to border proximity/openness.
 * No object extraction function was attempted, which would help identify connected 0-components for true enclosures (e.g., flood-fill from borders to distinguish inland holes); current neighbor-based detection misses multi-cell bays.
 * The 3-neighbor open direction logic works for simple cases (e.g., train 1 top) but breaks on open_num1==2 (far-side marking doesn't trigger properly, e.g., train 2 inner) and doesn't handle len(open_dirs)>1 or diagonal opens.
 * Single-pass processing misses iterative needs, like marking one bay exposing another.
 * Function `handle_bays_and_holes` is broken for complex/nested cases and over-marks borders (don't use as-is; needs refinement for open_dir filling strips and far-side logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially captures cleaning (removes protrusions in rows0-2 cols5-15 and row11-15 cols5-15 correctly as 0s) and some bay marking (e.g., row7 cols11-13=7s for a small enclosure, row8-10 cols10-12=7/0/7 pattern), but it does not look fully correct: misses marking larger bays like row5 col5-6 should lead to filling row6 col4? (hard to tell without expected, but based on patterns, likely needs 7s around row6-7 cols3-5 enclosure and row4 col13-15); incorrectly leaves row7 col15=0 (probably should be 1 or 7 if bay wall) and row9 col13=7 but adjacent row8 col13=1 (inconsistent with expected bay fills); the bottom structure row15 col15=1 is preserved but may need 7s if it's a bay wall. Overall, it under-marks enclosures (e.g., the L-shape at rows6-10 cols3-13 likely needs more 7s in the inner corner) and fails to handle the test's vertical thin connections similar to train 3's failure. This suggests the code detects simple 3-sided bays but misses multi-cell or directionally complex ones, making the output incomplete.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based shape processing, where the goal is to identify and mark (with 7) or remove (to 0) specific structural elements like thin protrusions, low-connectivity cells, or boundary configurations in binary shapes made of 1s, while preserving the core body of objects. The output grid modifies the input by highlighting removable or noise-like parts (7s) and sometimes erasing them, likely to isolate main shapes or clean up artifacts in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are composed of 1s on a 0 background; 7s seem to indicate cells targeted for removal or highlighting, often in thin arms, corners, or isolated extensions, but not the solid core.
 * Low-connectivity removal: Cells with 0 or 1 adjacent 1 (in 4 directions) should be removed early to prune isolated points or tips.
 * Thin protrusions: Cells surrounded by >=3 non-1s (edges or 0s) in 4 directions are likely noise and should be set to 0, but this must happen after initial marking to avoid over-removal.
 * Boundary scanning from 0 cells: Analyze adjacent 1s from empty spaces; configurations like single adjacent 1 (e.g., vertical chains of exactly 3 empty above a rightward protrusion) or 2-3 adjacent 1s (opposites for lines, L-shapes, or corners) trigger marking of nearby 1s to 7, but skip if the open side leads to a high-connectivity empty cell (e.g., >=2 or ==3 neighbors).
 * Directional exclusions: For horizontal/vertical lines or corners, exclude marking upward if the open side is rightward to avoid over-marking vertical extensions.
 * 8-adjacency marking: When marking from L or corner configs, use 8 directions but sometimes exclude up; this catches diagonal protrusions but risks over-marking if not conditioned on openness.
 * Second pass: After thin removal, re-scan for remaining 1s adjacent via single direction (non-up/down) and mark the adjacent 1 to 7 if it's a lingering tip.
 * Subtleties: Horizontal vs. vertical handling differs (e.g., mark 3 cells right for horizontals, down for verticals); chain lengths matter (e.g., exactly 3 empty above for specific protrusions); avoid marking solid bodies (e.g., skip if open side has >1 neighbor 1s); empty rows/columns separate objects, and processing must not bleed across them.
 * Over-removal risk: Functions like remove_low_connect can erase valid cores if applied too early; thin removal after marking helps, but mis-marking leads to chain reactions.
 * Under-marking: Complex shapes with internal 0s or diagonals may miss L/corner detections if neighbor counts aren't 8-way in some checks.
 * Grid boundaries: Always check bounds to avoid index errors, treating out-of-bounds as 0 (non-1).

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; grids are List[List[int]]. These functions are mostly helpful but need integration tweaks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a multi-pass approach (low-connect removal, config-based marking from 0s, thin protrusion removal, second marking) which partially captures boundary detection but fails on specifics like chain lengths and directional marking.
 * Worked: Basic pruning of low-connect and thin parts; 4/8-dir neighbor logic identifies some L/corners and opposites for lines; marking some protrusions to 7 in simple cases (e.g., rightward arms in Train 1).
 * Didn't work: Over-marking solid areas (e.g., in Train 1 row 5, generated sets [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] but expected keeps more 1s like [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] with differences in later rows; unknown why row 1 col 16 is 1 in generated vs 7 expected). In Train 1, row 6 has all 0s generated but expected [0s with 7s in cols 7-9]; this suggests thin removal erased marked areas prematurely or marking missed a horizontal extension.
 * Train 2: Generated marks too many 7s early (e.g., row 2 [1,7,7,7,1,...] vs expected all 1s [1,1,1,1,1,...]), over-pruning a solid top bar; row 5 has [1,7,0,0,...] but expected [1,1,0,0,...] with later 1s turned to 7s—missed shifting marking down for vertical parts; row 13 generated [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,...] but expected same with more 7s in cols 6-8, indicating under-marking of a bottom protrusion.
 * Train 3: Major failure—generated marks internal parts of a single shape (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,...] but expected [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,...] with 7s only in specific cols 9-11; row 7 [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7,0,...] vs expected similar but 7s in cols 9-11 and 13; row 13 all 0s generated vs expected [0s,7s in cols 6-8]). This shows over-marking of core (e.g., treating inner Ls as protrusions) and missing preservation of main body; thin removal likely wiped marked but connected areas.
 * Config detection bugs: Num==1 only handles rightward with exact 3-up chain, missing other singles; num==2 opposites mark inconsistently (e.g., vertical marks down 3 but not always adjacent); num==3 skips if open empty has ==3 neighbors, but may false-positive on diagonals; L-shape skip condition (both opens empty with <=1 neighbor) is too strict, leading to under-marking.
 * No object extraction function; all processing is global scan, which works for separated shapes but fails on interconnected ones without per-object isolation.
 * The second marking pass is underused—only catches single-dir tips but misses after thin removal changes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it marks excessive 7s in what seems a complex shape with arms (e.g., rows 4-9 show heavy 7-marking in cols 10-14 like [7,0,7,7,0] in row 4, but based on patterns from training, cores should preserve more 1s—e.g., expected might keep row 4 as more 1s with targeted 7s only on tips, similar to Train 1's partial matches).
 * Top rows 0-2 all 1s preserved (good, likely solid bar), but row 3 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7,0,0] marks a right protrusion to 7/0, which may be correct if thin, but row 5 [1,1,1,7,7,0,7,1,...] inserts 0s and 7s oddly—likely over-removal of a diagonal or bend, unlike expected clean marking in similar Train 3 bends.
 * Bottom rows 10-15 show under-marking (e.g., row 11 [1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] has isolated 0/7, but training suggests vertical extensions should mark down 3 consistently without gaps); row 12 all low 1s then 0s may miss a bottom arm.
 * Overall, it partially prunes but creates fragmented 7/0 patterns that don't align with training expectations of targeted tip-marking without core erosion; unclear why cols 11-12 have many 0s (perhaps thin removal over-applied post-marking), but it looks noisy rather than clean.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary image processing on a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/objects), where the goal is to clean up noise by removing small connected components of 1s, identify and fill small enclosed holes (internal 0-regions not connected to the border background) by dilating their boundaries to 7s, and handle isolated border 0s similarly as small holes. The output modifies the original grid: small 1-components become 0s, small holes get dilated boundaries marked as 7s (while keeping hole interiors as 0s), and larger structures remain intact.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), not diagonal.
 * Background 0s are all 0-regions reachable from the grid borders via flood-fill; any internal 0s not reachable are enclosed holes.
 * Small 1-components are defined as size <2 (single isolated 1s), which get set to 0; larger 1-groups (size >=2) are preserved as objects.
 * Small holes are enclosed 0-components of size <=3, plus any single isolated 0s on the border; these are not filled entirely but dilated: surrounding pixels (3x3 neighborhood, excluding the hole itself) are set to 7 to "highlight" or expand the boundary.
 * Dilation for holes only affects non-hole pixels (e.g., 1s become 7s); hole pixels stay 0.
 * Border single 0s are treated as small holes even if connected to background, but only if truly isolated (no adjacent 0s).
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects, varying sizes, and holes of different scales; larger holes (>3) are left as 0s without dilation.
 * Bottom rows or edges may have partial structures or all-0 lines that should not be altered unless they qualify as small components/holes.
 * Subtle: In get_background_positions, ensure flood-fill starts only from border 0s and marks all reachable 0s; enclosed 0s are the complement.
 * Subtle: In dilation, the 3x3 kernel around each small hole pixel should union across the component, but avoid overwriting hole 0s.
 * Subtle: After removing small 1s, re-evaluate holes on the original grid (not the cleaned one) to avoid altering hole detection.
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s that are single but adjacent to 1s might need special handling; also, holes touching borders aren't enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: In get_zero_components, it operates only on enclosed set, but assumes enclosed positions are valid; rows/cols inferred from max coords may fail if enclosed is empty.
 * Consideration: Outputs use 7 for dilated boundaries, 0 for holes/interiors/background, 1 for preserved objects; no other values.
 * All processing should preserve grid dimensions and non-qualifying pixels unchanged.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it implements core logic for small 1-removal and small hole dilation but fails all training examples due to incorrect hole identification and dilation placement.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly dilates some areas (e.g., row 3 col 7-9 missing 7s, row 4 col 7=0 but expected 7, row 5 col 7-9=7 but expected 0 in hole? Wait, differences in hole dilation: generated has extra 7s in row 16-17 and misses 7s in row 12 col 7, row 16 col 13-15=0 but expected 7s; also row 4 col 16=7 expected 7 but surrounding mismatch; unknown why dilation skips some boundaries.
 * Train 2: Generated adds unwanted 7s (e.g., row 8 col 13=1 but expected 1? Wait, row 8 col 13=0 expected 0, but row 9 col 13=1 expected 1, main issue: misses dilation in row 6 col 13-15=7 expected 7 but row 9 col 13=1 instead of expected 1? Differences: generated has row 6 col 13=0 but expected 7? No, row 6: generated [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] vs expected [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] - match? Wait, actual diff in row 15? Generated misses some 7s in lower parts; unknown, but border handling wrong as row 0 col 14=7 expected 7 but propagation fails.
 * Train 3: Generated incorrectly removes a small 1 in row 3 col 6=1 (sets to 0, but expected preserved? No, expected row 3 all 0s, but generated has it; main: misses dilation entirely in lower object (rows 11-13 expected 7s around hole at row 12 col 7=0, but generated has no 7s there, keeps all 1s; also row 13 col 6=0 expected 0 but no dilation; upper hole dilation partial, e.g., row 5 col 9-11=7 expected 7 but row 7 col 11=0 expected 0 match, but lower fails completely.
 * remove_small_components works for isolating noise but applied too early, before hole detection on original.
 * get_background_positions seems correct but may miss if borders have 1s blocking.
 * get_border_single_zeros is broken/not helpful: it checks isolation but enqueues only borders and marks visited prematurely, leading to missing some singles; also overlaps with background flood-fill, causing double-counting or skips.
 * dilate_small_holes is partially helpful but flawed: it unions 3x3 around holes and sets non-hole to 7, but in examples, it over-dilates (e.g., Train 1 row 1 col 3-4=7 expected 7 match but extends wrongly) or under-dilates (Train 3 lower hole untouched); doesn't exclude background 0s properly, and to_change includes holes themselves sometimes.
 * get_zero_components helpful but assumes enclosed from original grid; in program, enclosed computed on original g, good, but rows/cols from max may be inaccurate if grid larger.
 * Overall: Program structure good (clean 1s first, find holes on original, dilate), but border singles mishandled, dilation kernel applies to wrong pixels (e.g., sets some 0s to 7 incorrectly), and small hole threshold <=3 includes border singles but logic buggy.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies dilation to what seems a large internal hole (rows 4-10, cols 4-10 area with 0s turned to 7 boundaries), but over-dilates into the left 1-structure (e.g., row 4 col 4=7 but likely should be 1 if part of large object) and misses potential small holes elsewhere (e.g., row 11 col 6=0 isolated? but no 7 around it; also right side row 4 col 12=1 expected preserved but if small, removed? Unknown without expected, but looks like it treats a medium hole as small, adding 7s in row 7 col 3=0? Wait, generated has 7s in unexpected places like row 7 col 11=7 but may be overreach; bottom all-0 rows unchanged good, but upper left 1s dilated wrongly into 7s at row 4 col 4-6. It makes partial sense for one hole but ignores object connectivity, leading to broken shapes.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0 for empty, 1 for filled shapes) where the goal is to detect "cores" (internal holes or enclosed 0s with sufficient surrounding 1s), remove thin or protruding parts of shapes that are not structurally significant, and highlight boundary or adjacent areas around cores with 7 (likely representing dark red outlining or emphasis) while preserving the overall shape integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Cores are strictly defined as 0 cells with at least 3 orthogonal (up/down/left/right) 1 neighbors; diagonal neighbors do not count, and cores must be internal voids, not edge or open spaces.
 * Thin protrusions are 1 cells with fewer than 2 orthogonal 1 neighbors; these should be removed (set to 0) to simplify shapes, but only after core detection, and removals should not override core-adjacent highlighting.
 * Highlighting with 7 occurs around cores using 8-directional neighbors (including diagonals), but skips other cores and prioritizes setting 1s or low-connectivity 0s to 7; however, this must integrate with protrusion removal—e.g., a thin protrusion near a core might stay as 1 or get set to 7 instead of 0.
 * Subtlety: Highlighting applies to the original grid, but final output overrides thin removals only if not already set to 7, which can lead to incomplete outlining if thin parts are not reconsidered post-highlighting.
 * Grids have varying sizes but consistent structure (e.g., multiple disconnected shapes or "objects"); processing must handle all independently without assuming connectivity.
 * 7s form outlines or "dark red" borders around holes/cores, but only on non-core cells; avoid setting cores themselves or isolated 0s to 7 unless they meet low-connectivity criteria.
 * Easy to miss: Orthogonal-only for core detection and protrusion removal, but 8-directional for highlighting spread; also, protrusion removal uses the original grid, not an iterative process, which can miss chained thins.
 * Integration order matters: Detect cores first on original, remove thins separately, then apply highlighting, and finally reconcile (e.g., keep thin removals as 0 unless highlighting sets to 7).
 * No changes to existing 0s unless they are near cores and low-connectivity; shapes should remain mostly 1s except for removals and highlights.
 * Potential for multiple cores per shape; highlighting must not overlap destructively or fill holes.

from typing import List, Tuple, Set

def num_ortho_ones(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
    count = 0

    for di, dj in directions:
        ni = i + di
        nj = j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is helpful for core detection and protrusion checks, as it correctly counts only orthogonal 1 neighbors.)

```python
def identify_cores(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return set()
    cols = len(grid[0])
    cores: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) >= 3:
                cores.add((i, j))
    return cores
```
(This accurately identifies core positions and is essential for targeting highlighting.)

```python
def remove_thin_protrusions(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(grid[0])
    out = deepcopy(grid)
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) < 2:
                out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This is useful for simplifying shapes by removing low-connectivity 1s, but note it is non-iterative and based on original grid.)

```python
def get_neighbor_deltas() -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    deltas: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if di != 0 or dj != 0:
                deltas.append((di, dj))
    return deltas
```
(This provides 8-directional neighbors for highlighting spread around cores, which is key for outlining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly handled training example 3 (full match, demonstrating core detection and basic highlighting/removal work for simple cases), but failed training 1 and 2 due to incomplete 7 highlighting on certain boundary cells.
 * In training 1, generated output mismatches expected at row 12, column 7 (0-based: position (12,7) is 1 in generated but 7 in expected), and possibly others; this suggests highlighting did not propagate to all adjacent non-thin 1s near cores, leaving part of a core outline as 1 instead of 7.
 * In training 2, generated output mismatches expected in the top rows (e.g., row 0 column 14 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected; row 0 column 15 is 0 in generated but nothing shown, but overall top-right area lacks 7s), and row 8 column 13 is 1 in generated but expected has 7 there; this indicates failure to highlight thin or edge areas near cores in the upper shape.
 * The reconciliation step in program() overrides thin removals to 0 only if not 7, but this missed setting some 1s to 7 in original positions that were thin but core-adjacent (e.g., should prioritize 7 over removal in borders).
 * Core detection worked (as seen in correct training 3), but set_dark_red_around_holes is incomplete: it sets 7 on 1s or low-ortho 0s near cores, but skips if ortho_count >=2 for 0s, which may miss subtle hole boundaries; also, it uses original grid but doesn't fully integrate with temp_grid removals.
 * remove_thin_protrusions is helpful but non-iterative, potentially leaving pseudo-thin structures if multiple passes are needed (though not evident in examples).
 * No extraction of full objects/shapes was attempted, which might help for disconnected components, but current per-cell approach works for cores; adding object flooding could isolate shapes but isn't necessary yet.
 * The program assumes uniform grid size per row, which holds, but doesn't handle empty grids gracefully beyond basics.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on rules: it correctly identifies a core-like area in the middle-right (e.g., 7s around what seems a hole at ~row 4-11, col 10-12), removes some left-side thins (many 0s on left), and outlines with 7s in 8 directions, but it looks incorrect overall because the large central shape's hole outlining is inconsistent—e.g., row 5 col 5 is 0 (possible thin removal or hole extension) but adjacent 7s suggest incomplete fill/prevention of hole spillover, and top-left shape has no 7s despite potential internal voids.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have more precise 7 outlining around the evident hole in the bottom-left-ish shape (rows 3-12, cols 0-14), setting 7s on all 8-neighbor borders without leaving isolated 1s inside (e.g., row 7 col 3 is 0 in generated, but if it's a thin near core, it should be 7 or removed consistently); also, right-side protrusions (col 14-15) have scattered 0s that seem over-removed, missing 7 borders.
 * The test output does not fully look correct: It over-applies 0s in thin areas without reconciling to 7 (e.g., row 3 col 13 is 1 but surrounded by 0s, should be removed or highlighted if near core), and the bottom shape (rows 10-12) has 7s that don't close the outline properly, suggesting the highlighting function missed some deltas or low-connectivity checks.
 * To handle test case, need to ensure highlighting scans all core neighbors post-removal and sets 7 on any remaining 1s or adjacent 0s <2 ortho, avoiding the generated's patchy borders.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a binary grid (0s as empty/open spaces, 1s as filled/structural elements) to identify and mark specific patterns like isolated cells, enclosed areas, bays (single/double horizontal/vertical), L-shapes, and edge straights by changing qualifying 1s to 7s (likely indicating "filled" or "boundary" cells), while leaving others as 1 or 0. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected markings for training cases, suggesting rules for detecting connected components, neighbor counts, and directional openness in a maze-like or shape-filling context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules involve neighbor counting in 4 directions (up, down, left, right); 1s with 0 neighbors are isolated and removed (set to 0), while 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) trigger marking adjacent 1s as 7s to "fill" enclosures.
 * Bays are key patterns: single bays (0 with exactly 3 one-neighbors, indicating one open direction) mark the 3 closing 1s as 7s plus specific diagonals; double bays (two adjacent 0s each with 3 one-neighbors) mark sides and sometimes fill centers or extensions, but only if not part of larger opens (e.g., skip if open side leads to another 3-neighbor 0 or straight-line extension).
 * L-bays (0 with exactly 2 non-opposite one-neighbors) mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal between them as 7s; opposites (horizontal or vertical straights) are skipped to avoid false positives.
 * Edge straights handle boundary cases: horizontal 0s on top/bottom with only left/right 1s (no up/down) mark those sides as 7s; vertical on sides mark up/down 1s.
 * Subtleties include directionality (e.g., open direction in single bays determines which diagonals to mark: up/down opens fill horizontal diagonals below/above; left/right fill vertical diagonals right/left); avoiding over-marking by checking if open cell is another bay or straight (e.g., skip single bay if open neighbor has 3 ones or is a horizontal/vertical extension); sequence matters (e.g., remove isolated first, then enclosures, then bays to prevent interference).
 * Vertical double bays require explicit checks for open left/right (e.g., both 0s open right means left/top/bottom 1s marked, right centers filled unless edge); symmetric for left.
 * Easy misses: not skipping overlapping patterns (e.g., double horizontal bay skips by +2 cols to avoid double-count); handling edges/boundaries (no wrap-around, out-of-bounds treated as non-1); potential over-filling in non-edge centers (set to 7 unless bottom/top row); diagonals only in specific bay types, not all; isolated removal happens before marking to clean grid but uses original g for counts.
 * General: Grid sizes vary (e.g., 17x19, 16x16, 16x16); outputs preserve 0s and change only 1s to 7s (no 1 to 0 except isolated); patterns may nest or chain, so order (enclosed > doubles > edges > L > single) is crucial; no rotation/symmetry assumed beyond explicit vertical/horizontal handlers.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) partially understands core rules like neighbor counting, isolation removal, and bay detection but fails all training examples due to bugs in pattern skipping, over-marking, and sequence.
 * Worked: remove_isolated correctly cleans stray 1s (e.g., no extras in empty areas); count_one_neighbors is accurate and reusable; basic enclosure marking (handle_enclosed) identifies 4-neighbor 0s but over-marks adjacent 1s without boundary checks.
 * Didn't work: handle_double_horizontal_bays over-marks or misses skips (e.g., in Train1 row1 cols3-4: generates 7s where expected has 0/7 mix; Train2 incorrectly marks inner bays as 7s instead of leaving as 1/0); c +=2 skip is good but condition (num_left==3 and num_right==3) triggers falsely without full config check (e.g., doesn't verify open side).
 * handle_double_vertical_bays is broken: r +=1 skip is inside col loop but affects outer r loop incorrectly (off-by-one overlaps); checks for open right/left are too rigid (e.g., Train1 doesn't trigger properly, leaving bottom bays unmarked); center_val logic sets to 0 only on absolute edge but ignores if it's a "fill" case.
 * handle_edge_straights partially works for horizontals (marks sides on top/bottom) but verticals fail boundary logic (e.g., left_one/right_one always False on edges, but condition requires not left_one etc., causing no marks); up_one/down_one mishandle r==0/rows-1 as False correctly but not applied symmetrically.
 * handle_L_bays misses non-edge cases and over-marks diagonals (e.g., Train3 row5 col9-11: generates extra 7s in what should be straight 1s); sorted(one_dirs) and opposites check is good but doesn't handle chained Ls.
 * handle_single_bays is most buggy: skip logic for open cell (if 3 neighbors or straight extension) is incomplete (e.g., Train1 row10 col6: marks 0s as 7 where expected has 0s, failing vertical open check); diagonal marking is direction-specific but errors in indices (e.g., open_i==1 marks upper diagonals correctly but overfills horizontals); additional fill for open 0 extends wrongly (e.g., fills 3-wide but ignores if open leads to edge).
 * Overall: Sequence (doubles before singles) causes over-marking in nested bays; no iteration/refinement loop, so one-pass misses propagations; Train1 diffs: row10 col5-7 all 7s (gen) vs 7,0,7/7,0,0,7 (exp, under-marked centers); row13 all 1s (gen) vs mixed 7s (exp, missed bay); Train2 diffs: row2 all 1s (gen) vs mixed (exp, missed upper structure); row3 col1-2 7,0 (gen) vs 1,0 (exp, over-marked); row6 col13-15 0,7,0 (gen) vs 0,7,7 (exp, under); Train3 diffs: row4 col4-7 1,7,7,7 (gen) vs all 1s (exp, over-marked premature bay); row12 col6-8 7,7,7 (gen) vs 7,0,7 (exp, filled center wrongly).
 * No object extraction function attempted, but patterns suggest needing one for connected 1-components (e.g., to validate bay openness globally); current funcs are local and miss global shape constraints.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: handle_double_vertical_bays (symmetric but loop-buggy, over-constrains configs like requiring r-1 and r+2 always 1); additional fill in single_bays (extends to 0s but sets result[...]=7 even if original 0, but puzzle preserves 0s—wait, code checks if result==1 before set, but for open 0 it sets without check, wrongly filling empties).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-marks many interior 1s as 7s (e.g., rows 3-5 cols10-12 all 7s, suggesting false double bay trigger) and under-marks edges (e.g., row2 col4=7 but adjacent 0s not handled as single bay properly, leaving potential L unmarked); compared to visual intuition, the left structure looks like a bay/opening needing selective 7s on boundaries only, but output fills too much (e.g., row6 col3=7 where it might be straight 1); right side row2 cols10-12=7,7,7 seems like enclosure but test has irregular 0s that should skip per rules; overall, it resembles over-aggressive bay detection without proper skip for chains/extensions, making the output too "filled" vs. expected sparse markings—likely fails if test expects similar to Train1's mixed 0/7 in bays.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), I analyzed for obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements that appear in **every** train pair (1, 2, and 3). Only properties with clear, repeatable links across all examples are included—e.g., direct mappings like position influencing placement, hole counts affecting similar properties in outputs, or pixel changes due to overlay. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel blues that do not reliably map across all, or background bands without specific interactions) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forcing of unclear links is attempted. Where a transformation cannot be clearly explained as consistent, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Blue Component Bounding Box (Position) → Dark Red Component Bounding Box (Position)**
   - **Description**: In every train pair, output Dark Red components are positioned within or directly adjacent to the bounding boxes (bbox) of input Blue components that have holes > 0. This creates a spatial interaction where input positions constrain or "anchor" output placements.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input Blue with holes=1 (bbox [0,9,16,14]) links to output Dark Red at [4,9,7,12] (fully within) and partially to [7,3,9,5] (adjacent y-overlap with nearby band).
     - Train 2: Input Blue with holes=1 (bbox [6,5,11,9]) links to output Dark Red at [7,6,9,8] (within) and [13,5,15,9] (adjacent right extension); input Blue with holes=3 (bbox [0,0,15,15]) links to [14,0,15,1] (top within), [5,12,8,14] (bottom within).
     - Train 3: Input Blue with holes=2 (bbox [4,3,13,12]) links to output Dark Red at [9,5,12,8] (fully within) and [6,11,8,13] (within, y-overlap).
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional anchoring/transformation. No unexplained gaps; all Dark Red placements trace to at least one input Blue bbox with holes > 0.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Exact offset rules (e.g., why some are centered vs. adjacent) cannot be consistently explained without further data.

#### 2. **Input Blue Pixel Count → Output Blue Pixel Count (in Corresponding Bbox)**
   - **Description**: In every train pair, Blue components in output that share overlapping or identical bboxes with input Blue components (especially those with holes > 0) have strictly reduced pixel counts. This indicates a consistent overlay interaction where new elements (Dark Red) displace blue pixels without adding new blue area.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input top Blue (82 pixels, [0,0,16,4]) → output 67 pixels (reduction of 15); middle (83 pixels, [0,9,16,14]) → 70 pixels (reduction of 13); bottom (33 pixels, [0,17,16,18]) → 28 pixels total across split components (reduction of 5).
     - Train 2: Input mid Blue (29 pixels, [6,5,11,9]) → 21 pixels (reduction of 8); large (164 pixels, [0,0,15,15]) → 139 pixels (reduction of 25).
     - Train 3: Input main Blue (88 pixels, [4,3,13,12]) → 70 pixels (reduction of 18, with adjusted bbox [4,4,13,12]).
   - **Interaction Type**: Displacement/overlay. Reductions are always positive and occur only in blues with matching positional ties; total blue pixels decrease globally in each pair.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: The exact amount of reduction (e.g., tied to Dark Red pixel count?) is consistent in direction but not in a formulaic ratio across all.

#### 3. **Input Blue Hole Count → Output Dark Red Hole Count (in Linked Positions)**
   - **Description**: Input Blue components with holes > 0 consistently result in output Dark Red components (in linked positions per #1) that have hole counts of 1 or more, often mirroring or partitioning the input hole count. This suggests holes "transfer" or evolve into Dark Red structures.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input holes=1 (in [0,9,16,14]) → output Dark Red with holes=1 (e.g., [4,9,7,12]) in linked position.
     - Train 2: Input holes=1 (in [6,5,11,9]) → output Dark Red with holes=1 (e.g., [13,5,15,9], [7,6,9,8]); input holes=3 (in [0,0,15,15]) → three output Dark Red each with holes=1 (total holes=3, partitioned).
     - Train 3: Input holes=2 (in [4,3,13,12]) → output Dark Red with holes=2 ([9,5,12,8]) and holes=1 ([6,11,8,13]) in linked positions (total holes=3, but core link preserves multi-hole structure).
   - **Interaction Type**: Hole transfer/partitioning. Total output Dark Red holes are always ≥ input holes in linked components, with at least one Dark Red inheriting a non-zero hole count.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Partitioning logic (e.g., why holes=3 splits into three 1's in Train 2 but holes=2 stays partially intact in Train 3) cannot be consistently explained; appears context-dependent on component size or position.

#### 4. **Input Blue Hole Count → Output Blue Hole Count (in Corresponding Bbox)**
   - **Description**: Blue components in output that overlap input Blue bboxes with holes > 0 consistently have equal or reduced hole counts, indicating holes are "absorbed" or resolved by interacting elements (e.g., Dark Red overlays).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input holes=1 ([0,9,16,14]) → output holes=0 ([0,9,16,13], reduced).
     - Train 2: Input holes=1 ([6,5,11,9]) → output holes=1 (same, preserved); input holes=3 ([0,0,15,15]) → output holes=1 (reduced).
     - Train 3: Input holes=2 ([4,3,13,12]) → output holes=1 (reduced).
   - **Interaction Type**: Hole absorption/reduction. Never increases; occurs only in positionally linked blues.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Preservation vs. reduction trigger (e.g., why holes=1 stays 1 in Train 2 but reduces in Train 1) is not consistently explainable.

#### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **Components Involved**: Only Blue (input/output) and Dark Red (output) show interactions; no consistent links to other elements (e.g., small accents or grid lines do not reliably interact across all).
- **Non-Interactions Excluded**: Input single-pixel Blues (pixels=1, holes=0) disappear or fragment in outputs but do not consistently map to specific Dark Red properties or positions across all trains (e.g., variable influence on edges in Train 1 vs. Train 3), so omitted. Background bands provide canvas but no direct effects. Symmetry/asymmetry varies and is not a consistent driver.
- **Test Inputs**: Not analyzed for interactions, as they lack outputs; patterns above are train-only for consistency validation.
- **Unknown Transformations Overall**: Broader rules (e.g., why Dark Red pixel counts vary like 5-12, or color shift from implied black to Dark Red) cannot be explained consistently without solving the puzzle; these appear tied to shape properties (e.g., edges/silhouettes) not fully captured in the data.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:16:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the grid by removing isolated 1s, identifying and marking specific "bay" or "hole" patterns (like enclosed areas or protrusions) with 7s, and applying rules iteratively to simulate filling or elimination in something akin to a Battleship-style puzzle or contour-filling game.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 1-neighbors in 4 directions) at the start and end to clean up single-cell artifacts not connected to larger structures.
 * Handle enclosed holes: Mark 1s around a 0 fully surrounded by 1s in 4 directions (and optionally diagonals) as 7s, treating it as a filled interior; use 8 directions for broader marking but check diagonals strictly for confirmation.
 * Double horizontal bays: Detect two adjacent 0s in a row, each with exactly 3 1-neighbors, and mark surrounding 1s (including below and sides) as 7s if they form a bay-like indentation; skip or increment carefully to avoid overlap.
 * Double vertical bays: Similar to horizontal but for columns; check for matching open directions (left or right only) and mark adjacent 1s, including perpendicular sides; requires identifying the open side consistently.
 * L-bays: For a 0 with exactly two adjacent 1s in non-opposite directions (forming an L), mark those 1s and the diagonal corner as 7s.
 * Single bays: For a 0 with exactly three 1-neighbors (one open side), mark the three 1s as 7s unless the open side leads to another bay (skip to avoid chaining); additionally, fill diagonal or perpendicular extensions if they are isolated or 1s, and conditionally fill the open center 0 if no perpendicular empty neighbors have 1s.
 * Subtleties: Use 4-directional neighbors for most counts (up/down/left/right) but 8 for some fillings; avoid over-marking by checking original grid 'g' vs. working 'out'; iterate carefully (e.g., while loops with increments) to handle adjacent patterns without missing/skipping; open directions must align for vertical bays (only left/right, not up/down); do not fill if patterns nest or chain infinitely; apply removals before and after other handlers to propagate changes.
 * Easy to miss: Syntax errors from inline comments or incomplete loops break everything; duplicated functions (e.g., two remove_isolated); inconsistent indexing (e.g., using 'c' for rows); unhandled edge cases like grid boundaries or zero-size grids; marking only if original is 1, not propagated 7s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_num_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is a solid, reusable helper for counting 4-directional 1-neighbors; essential for bay detection and isolation checks.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and g[i + di][j + dj] == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This works for removing isolated 1s based on original grid; apply early and late in pipeline. The duplicate 'remove_remaining_isolated' is identical and unneeded—consolidate.)

(No other functions from this attempt are particularly helpful yet, as most are broken or overly specific.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it attempts to cover core rules like isolation removal, hole filling, and bay types (single, L, double horizontal/vertical), showing some understanding of pattern detection via neighbor counts and directions.
 * What worked: Conceptual structure (pipeline of handlers), get_num_one_neighbors function is correct and reusable, basic isolation removal logic is sound (though duplicated), and intent to mark with 7s for patterns matches puzzle goals.
 * What didn't work: Severe syntax errors (e.g., line 74 in handle_double_horizontal_bays has malformed code like "if g[c // wait no, for r in range(rows-1), for c in range(1, cols-1?" with inline comments and incomplete loops, causing total execution failure); inconsistent loop structures (while loops with bad increments in horizontal/vertical bays); unhandled edge cases in single_bays (e.g., potential index errors in diagonal fills); no testing or validation, leading to all examples (training 1-3 and test) failing with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 74)".
 * Missed proper loop syntax and variable scoping (e.g., 'c' used ambiguously in horizontal bays); overcomplicated vertical bays with redundant r-increments; L_bays skips opposites correctly but doesn't handle all rotations; single_bays has good skip logic for chaining but buggy conditional fills (e.g., assumes open_i without full bounds checks).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob detection or component labeling), which might help identify connected 1s but isn't essential here—focus on local patterns instead.
 * All handlers modify 'out' in place based on original 'g', which is good for non-destructive checks, but propagation (e.g., re-running after marks) is missing beyond final isolation.
 * Training examples 1-3 and test all failed identically due to syntax, so no observed outputs to compare—expected grids with marked 7s in bays/holes and cleaned isolations, but got nothing runnable.
 * Functions like handle_double_horizontal_bays and handle_double_vertical_bays are broken due to syntax/loops (don't reuse without full rewrite); handle_enclosed_holes and handle_L_bays are closer but untested; handle_single_bays is overly verbose with repeated bounds checks (simplify).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so it does not make sense or run at all—nothing is generated, which is completely incorrect as the puzzle requires a processed grid with 0s, 1s, and 7s marking resolved patterns.
 * Without execution, we can't observe effects, but based on code intent, it would likely over-mark or miss bays if fixed (e.g., horizontal bays loop is garbled, so adjacent double 0s might be skipped entirely); differs from expected by not producing any grid—expected: isolated 1s removed, enclosed 0s' surroundings marked 7, bays filled appropriately without chaining errors.
 * No way to confirm if it handles test-specific subtleties (e.g., edge bays or nested patterns) since it crashes; prioritize fixing syntax and adding print/debug for grid states to verify.

[2025-10-03 15:16:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:20:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for shape pixels) to detect and outline boundaries of enclosed regions, holes, or "dents" (openings) in connected components of 1s by marking relevant boundary 1s with 7, while leaving internal 1s as 1, external/open areas as 0, and removing isolated 1s. The goal appears to be highlighting the "edges" or walls around fully enclosed voids or partially open indentations in shapes, with special rules for different orientations and configurations of openings to avoid over- or under-marking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Start by removing isolated 1s (those with zero 4-directional neighbors that are 1), as they are noise and not part of meaningful shapes.
 * For fully enclosed 0s (a 0 cell surrounded by 1s on all four cardinal directions), mark all eight surrounding 1s (if present) as 7 to outline internal holes.
 * Handle "dents" or openings in shapes: These are 0 cells adjacent to 1s but not fully enclosed, requiring orientation-specific logic (upward-open, downward-open, left-open, right-open, bottom-horizontal). For example, upward dents (open top, closed bottom/left/right) should mark the bottom wall and sides; downward dents need to consider wall lengths (min of left/right) to decide if the dent floor or ceiling gets marked (e.g., if short walls <=3, mark the dent cell itself; if longer, mark above).
 * Subtleties include: Using 4-connectivity for neighbor counts in enclosures but 8-connectivity for marking around them; avoiding marking external boundaries or open exteriors; handling edge cases like grid borders (treat as open/0); preventing over-marking where dents connect to larger openings; for bottom-horizontal dents, mark only if above is open and below is closed, focusing on horizontal walls and 3-wide below; left/right dents mark 3-neighbor 0s missing one side; do not mark entire shapes, only boundaries around voids/dents; iterations may be needed if markings affect later detections, but current code does sequential passes without re-checking.
 * Across attempts, consider connected components: Shapes may have multiple holes/dents; markings should not propagate to unrelated areas; subtle element: Some dents require measuring arm lengths (e.g., left/right wall continuity) to decide marking depth; avoid marking 1s that are internal to solid areas; grid may have multiple disconnected objects, so process globally but locally per cell.
 * Other considerations: No diagonal-only connections count as neighbors for enclosure (use 4-dir); after marking, original 1s in non-boundary positions stay 1; 0s stay 0 unless they're part of a dent that gets filled/marked (but code doesn't fill, only marks adjacent 1s); potential for cascading effects if dents are adjacent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:
        return g[r][c]
    return 0
```
(This safe grid accessor is essential for boundary checks without index errors.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1:
                n_up = get(g, i - 1, j)
                n_down = get(g, i + 1, j)
                n_left = get(g, i, j - 1)
                n_right = get(g, i, j + 1)
                n1 = (1 if n_up == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_down == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_left == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_right == 1 else 0)
                if n1 == 0:
                    result[i][j] = 0
    return result
```
(This correctly removes single isolated 1s using 4-connectivity and works in all examples.)

```python
def color_enclosed_boundaries(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs8 = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 0:
                n_up = get(g, i - 1, j)
                n_down = get(g, i + 1, j)
                n_left = get(g, i, j - 1)
                n_right = get(g, i, j + 1)
                n1 = (1 if n_up == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_down == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_left == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_right == 1 else 0)
                if n1 == 4:
                    for dr, dc in dirs8:
                        ni = i + dr
                        nj = j + dc
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and g[ni][nj] == 1:
                            result[ni][nj] = 7
    return result
```
(This identifies and marks around fully enclosed 0s correctly for internal holes, using 4-dir enclosure but 8-dir marking; helpful but may need to run after other steps if dents create enclosures.)

(The dent-handling functions like handle_open_up_dents, handle_open_down_dents, etc., are attempts at orientation-specific logic but are broken/incomplete: e.g., handle_open_down_dents over-marks ceilings for long walls and mishandles short ones; handle_open_left_dents and handle_open_right_dents use simplistic 3-neighbor checks but fail on asymmetric openings; handle_bottom_horizontal_dents incorrectly assumes open above for all cases and over-marks horizontals; these are not helpful in current form and should be revised or replaced with more robust dent detection, perhaps using flood-fill for openness or component analysis. No extraction of full objects/components was attempted, which could help by isolating shapes before boundary detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a sequential pipeline: remove isolated, color enclosed, then handle various dents; this correctly removes isolates and marks some internal holes but fails overall due to flawed dent logic.
 * What worked: remove_isolated properly clears lone 1s (e.g., no extras in Train 1 row 15); color_enclosed_boundaries catches some holes (e.g., marks the 7s around the 0 in Train 1 rows 4-5 correctly).
 * What didn't: Dent handlers over-mark or under-mark boundaries; e.g., in Train 1, generated marks rows 7-9 fully with 7s (including where expected is all 0s), and row 10 has extra 7s in cols 5-7 instead of expected 7s only in col 5; row 11 expected has 0s in cols 6-7 but generated has 7s; bottom rows (16-18) generated has scattered 7s/1s where expected has structured 7s around a 0; unknown why row 18 col 16 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected.
 * In Train 2, generated over-marks large areas with 7s (e.g., rows 3-5 cols 5-13 all 7s, but expected has 0s there initially, with 7s only in specific dent spots like row 6 cols 13-15); row 9 has extra 7s in cols 2-6; row 10 has 7s where expected 0s; row 13 has 7 in col 8 but expected 0; row 14 has extra 0s in cols 6-8.
 * In Train 3, generated prematurely marks upper empty areas with 7s (e.g., row 1 all 0s expected but has scattered 7s/0s; rows 2-4 have extra 7s around non-existent shapes); row 4 col 4 is 7 but expected 0; lower parts like row 12 expected has 7s in cols 6-8 but generated has them in row 13; overall, it fills voids too aggressively without checking openness.
 * No object extraction attempted, which would help isolate shapes and detect per-component dents/holes; current global cell-by-cell scanning causes spillover between objects.
 * Function handle_open_down_dents is particularly unhelpful/broken: It always marks below 3-wide and mishandles min_len logic (e.g., marks center for <=3 but over-marks above for >3 incorrectly in Train 1); avoid reusing without fix.
 * All handlers ignore potential iteration (e.g., after marking one dent, re-scan for new enclosures); this misses chained effects.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-marks large horizontal strips of 7s (e.g., rows 1-3 cols 5-10 all 7s, suggesting it treated an open area as enclosed); row 4 has 7s in cols 5-6 and 10-12 but leaves col 7 as 1 (internal), which might be partial but expected likely needs more precise dent outlining without filling solids; row 5 has 0 in col 5 but 7s around, possibly missing a left-dent mark; rows 11-12 have 7s in cols 5-7 but 0 in row 12 col 6, inconsistent with expected boundary rules; bottom rows 13-15 all 0s after 7s, but test input has solid 1s at top, so likely under-marking external dents or over-removing isolates incorrectly (no isolates visible in input). Overall, it resembles the training failures with excessive 7 strips, missing subtle open dent boundaries (e.g., the jagged shape on right likely needs targeted 7s around its opening, not full rows); does not make sense as it turns solid areas into boundaries without voids.

[2025-10-03 15:20:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

[2025-10-03 15:24:36] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty/white, 1s for blue/filled cells) to remove isolated blue cells (single 1s with no adjacent 1s) by setting them to 0, and then highlighting certain blue cells adjacent to "small holes" (0s surrounded by at least 3 blue neighbors) by setting them to 7, likely to emphasize boundaries or internal structures in a visual puzzle like a cave or blob detection.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Isolated blues (1s) are strictly those with exactly 0 adjacent 1s (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and they must be removed to 0 before any highlighting, as they don't contribute to connected structures.
 * Small holes are 0 cells with >=3 adjacent 1s; highlighting applies to nearby 1s (horizontal left/right, and vertical in adjacent rows for a 3-wide strip), but subtle rules include: only highlight actual 1s (not low-neighbor 0s, which seems like a bug), ensure highlighting doesn't propagate to non-hole-related 1s, and handle cases where holes are part of larger patterns without over-highlighting.
 * Subtleties: Removal of isolated 1s must not affect hole detection (e.g., an isolated 1 near a hole shouldn't create false holes); vertical highlighting should be symmetric but limited to direct adjacencies; in some cases, expected outputs show no highlighting on certain 1s even if near holes, suggesting holes must be "enclosed" or minimal size (e.g., 1x1 only, not larger voids); grids have empty borders (many 0s), so edge cases matter; 7s overwrite 1s but not 0s; order matters—removal first, then highlight on the modified grid.
 * Key misses: Over-highlighting empty 0s with <=1 neighbor in vertical directions (unwanted, as 7s appear in empty areas in generated outputs); failure to highlight specific 1s in horizontal/vertical strips around holes (e.g., missing inner 1s); isolated 1s not always removed correctly if they have subtle connections post-removal; larger structures like vertical bars or blobs require precise neighbor counting without diagonal consideration; expected outputs sometimes keep isolated-like 1s if they are part of keys or labels, but here all seem structural.
 * Considerations across attempts: No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components) was used, which might help identify true isolations vs. parts of shapes; highlighting logic assumes simple 4-dir neighbors but misses cases where holes are diagonal or multi-cell; test inputs have asymmetric patterns (e.g., L-shapes or irregular blobs), so rules must handle non-rectangular holes without filling them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def num_1_neighbors(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-directional only, no diagonals
    for dr, dc in dirs:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is useful for both isolation checks and hole detection; it's correct and reusable.)

```python
def is_isolated_blue(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    if g[r][c] != 1:
        return False
    return num_1_neighbors(r, c, g, rows, cols) == 0
```
(This correctly identifies single isolated 1s but may miss if "isolation" includes small groups; helpful as a base for removal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly implements basic 4-dir neighbor counting and isolated 1 removal in fill_isolated_blues, which works for clear singles but fails to remove some 1s that appear isolated in expected outputs (e.g., Train 1 row 14 col 8 remains 1 in generated but should be 0, possibly because it's not truly isolated in input or removal order issue).
 * Highlighting in highlight_small_holes detects small holes via >=3 neighbors (good for is_small_hole_center), but apply_horizontal_highlight only hits left/right 1s (partial match, works in some spots like Train 1 rows 4-5), while apply_vertical_highlight over-highlights by setting 7 on 0s with <=1 neighbor (unwanted, causes extra 7s in empty areas like Train 2 row 8 col 13-15 mismatch).
 * Train 1: Generated matches most of expected but differs in row 12 col 7 (1 instead of 7, missing vertical highlight on hole center); row 14 col 8 (1 instead of 0, failed isolation removal for unknown reason—possibly input has it connected subtly); row 16-17 match highlighting but overall incorrect due to these.
 * Train 2: Generated misses top-right highlights (row 0 ends 1,0 vs expected 7,0; row 1 ends 1,1 vs 7,7—likely undected small hole or isolation error); row 8 has partial highlights (e.g., col 7-9: 1,1,1 vs expected 7,7,7, missing vertical strip); row 5 col 13-15: 7,7,7 matches, showing some hole detection works.
 * Train 3: Generated incorrectly keeps a stray 1 in row 3 col 6 (should be 0, perhaps false isolation or no removal); highlighting in rows 5-8 and 11-12 partial (e.g., row 7 col 11: 0 vs expected 0, but misses some 7s in verticals); row 13 matches, but overall misses enclosing the central blob properly.
 * No object extraction function was used (e.g., connected components to group 1s), which could help distinguish true isolations from blob edges; current approach treats grid pixel-by-pixel, missing global structure.
 * apply_vertical_highlight is broken/not helpful (highlights low-neighbor 0s to 7, which pollutes empty space and doesn't match any expected 7 on 0s); apply_horizontal_highlight is partially helpful but too narrow for some holes.
 * program structure (remove then highlight) is logical and works for order, but temp grid copy is good practice.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows excessive and asymmetric highlighting (e.g., rows 3-11 have scattered 7s around what seems like a large irregular blob with internal 0s, but many 1s remain unhighlighted where expected might need full enclosure marking, similar to Train 1 misses; top rows 0-2 have no 7s despite potential small holes near col 10-12). 
 * It includes 7s in positions like row 4 col 4-6 and row 12 col 6-7, which might over-highlight non-hole 0s (echoing the vertical function bug), and fails to remove potential isolated 1s in borders (e.g., row 12 col 8-9 are 0,0 but structure suggests possible isolation errors). 
 * Compared to trainings, it mismatches by not fully highlighting vertical strips (e.g., row 9 col 11: 0 vs likely needing 7 if hole), and the bottom-heavy 7s in row 11 don't align with expected minimal hole emphasis; without input, hard to verify, but pattern suggests incomplete hole detection for multi-row voids, making it incorrect like the trainings.

[2025-10-03 15:24:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for filled cells) through morphological-like operations: removing "thin protrusions" (isolated or barely connected 1s), removing fully isolated 1s, and then highlighting (coloring to 7) any remaining 1s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to small connected components of 0s (size 1 or 2, using 4-connectivity for zeros but 8-connectivity for adjacency checks). The goal is likely to clean up noise in a visual pattern or identify boundaries/features around small holes or gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are rectangular lists of lists with consistent dimensions; assume 0s are background/empty, 1s are foreground/object pixels.
 * Connectivity for zero components uses 4 directions (up, down, left, right) for BFS/flood fill to find small enclosed or open spaces (size <=2).
 * Adjacency for coloring uses 8 directions (including diagonals) to mark 1s touching these small zero components, but only after prior cleaning steps.
 * Cleaning happens sequentially: first remove thin protrusions (1s with >=3 zero neighbors in 4 directions, indicating tips or spurs), then remove isolated 1s (those with 0 one-neighbors in 4 directions).
 * Subtlety: Cleaning modifies a copy of the grid, but coloring uses the original grid for zero detection (to preserve original small holes) while applying to the cleaned grid.
 * Potential misses: Over-removal if protrusions are checked simultaneously without iteration (single pass may leave remnants); small zero components might be open edges, not just enclosed holes; no handling for larger zero components (they shouldn't trigger coloring); diagonal adjacency is key for "touching" but not for zero connectivity.
 * Edge cases: Border cells have fewer neighbors; multiple small zero components per grid; after cleaning, some 1s might become isolated but aren't re-checked; output should preserve 0s and change only specific 1s to 7 (no other values).
 * General: Single-pass operations avoid infinite loops; use BFS for exact component sizing/collection; visited arrays prevent re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == 1:
                num_zero = 0
                for dr, dc in dirs4:
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a sequential pipeline (protrusions -> isolated -> coloring), which aligns with cleaning before highlighting, but fails entirely due to a syntax error in color_adjacent_to_small_zeros (incomplete if-block after first BFS attempt, line 61).
 * remove_thin_protrusions and remove_isolated are syntactically correct and likely work for their parts (single-pass neighbor counting in 4 directions), but untested due to overall error.
 * color_adjacent_to_small_zeros correctly identifies the need for BFS on original g for zeros, collection of small components (<=2), and 8-dir adjacency coloring on cleaned grid, but the code is broken (first BFS lacks body/indentation, leading to execution error; second BFS is good but orphaned).
 * No outputs generated for any example, so nothing "worked" in terms of producing grids; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) resulted in identical ERROR messages.
 * The main_program orchestrates steps correctly (temp_g for cleaning, result for coloring), but inherits the syntax issue.
 * No extraction of objects or other helper functions attempted; focus is purely on grid modifications.
 * Subtle issue: Single-pass cleaning might not handle chained dependencies (e.g., removing a protrusion could isolate another 1), but not addressed here.
 * Train examples 1-3 and test all failed identically (no grids output), differing from expected by not executing at all—expected would be modified grids with 0/1/7 values highlighting small-zero-adjacent areas after cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (syntax failure), so it does not make sense or look correct—it produced no grid at all, just a traceback about indentation after an if-statement.
 * Without execution, it can't match any expected cleaned/highlighted grid; for instance, if the test input has thin 1s, isolated points, or small zero gaps, the output should show removals (to 0) and colorings (to 7), but nothing was generated to compare.
 * This indicates the program can't handle the test input (or any input) due to the bug, missing all puzzle effects like protrusion removal or small-zero highlighting.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid of 0s (empty space) and 1s (solid elements, like walls or blobs), where the goal is to process the grid to identify and mark boundaries of enclosed holes, isolated elements, and various "bay" structures (indentations or openings in the 1s) by changing specific boundary 1s to 7s (indicating marked boundaries), while sometimes setting certain 1s to 0s or skipping markings to avoid over-processing nested or adjacent features. The processing must preserve the overall structure but highlight enclosures and bays without marking open or irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero adjacent 1s in 4 directions) by setting them to 0, as they are not part of any meaningful structure.
 * For enclosed holes (0s fully surrounded by 1s in all 4 directions), mark the 8 surrounding 1s (orthogonal and diagonal) as 7s to highlight the boundary, but only if it's a true enclosure—avoid marking if it's part of a larger open area.
 * Handle "double horizontal bays": Pairs of adjacent 0s in the same row, each with exactly 3 adjacent 1s (indicating a narrow horizontal indentation); mark the side walls (left of first 0, right of second 0) in both the bay row and the row below as 7s, and set any 1s in the centers of the row below to 0s to "fill" or open the bay—include a skip (c +=1) to avoid double-processing overlapping bays.
 * For L-bays (0s with exactly 2 orthogonal adjacent 1s that are not opposites, forming an L-shape), mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal 1 between them as 7s, but skip if the two 1s are opposite (straight line, not L).
 * For single bays (0s with exactly 3 orthogonal adjacent 1s, indicating one open direction), mark the 3 closed orthogonal 1s as 7s and the 2 diagonals on the closed side as 7s; include a skip condition if the open-side adjacent cell is a 0 with 3 adjacent 1s (to avoid marking nested bays); add extra filling for vertical opens by marking 3 horizontal cells in the open direction as 7s if that cell is 0.
 * Process in sequence: isolated removal first, then enclosed holes, then double bays, L-bays, single bays—order matters to avoid interfering with prior markings (e.g., don't mark a bay if it's already resolved as an enclosure).
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals are crucial for enclosures and bays but not for adjacency counts (use 4-dir for neighbors, 8-dir for boundaries); avoid over-marking adjacent structures (e.g., shared walls between bays should not all be marked if it breaks the shape); handle edges/boundaries carefully (check bounds); nested or adjacent bays require skips to prevent cascading errors; vertical/horizontal symmetry isn't assumed, so check all orientations; 7s should only replace 1s, never create new 1s or change 0s to 7s directly.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided), considerations include avoiding double-counting in loops (e.g., c +=1 in double bays), distinguishing L from straight openings, and conditional skips for nested features— but execution often over-marks or under-marks due to incomplete pattern matching.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 17x17 for train 1, 16x16 for test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic.

No extraction functions provided (e.g., no def extract_objects), but the modular rule functions act as such—useful for debugging individual rules.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, but it fails all trainings due to over-marking boundaries (e.g., marking 1s as 7s where they should remain 1s or become 0s) and missing skips for nested structures.
 * Missed handling vertical double bays (only horizontal implemented, causing asymmetry in train 2 row 12-14 where expected has vertical 7s but generated has horizontals).
 * Over-marked in train 1: row 11 has 7,7,7,7 but expected 7,0,0,7 (likely from double bay not setting centers to 0 correctly or L/single interfering); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7 but expected all 1s (enclosed hole or bay overreach); row 14 has 7 at col 8 but expected 0 (isolated marking error).
 * Train 2 mismatches: row 2 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (L-bay falsely triggered); row 5 has 1,7,7,0 but expected 1,1,0,... (single bay over-marks); row 12 has 1,7,7,1 but expected all 1s (double bay misses vertical); row 13 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,0,7 but expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7 (under-marks vertical bay).
 * Train 3 mismatches: row 3 has 7 at col 6 but expected 0 (enclosed hole falsely marks non-boundary); row 4 has 1,7,7,7,1 but expected 1,1,1,1,1 (single/L bay over-marks open area).
 * Function handle_double_horizontal_bays is partially helpful but broken for vertical cases and over-sets 0s incorrectly in some nestings (don't rely solely, extend to vertical).
 * Function handle_L_bays is unhelpful or incorrect for non-horizontal Ls and triggers falsely on near-opposites (avoid until rotations added).
 * Function handle_single_bays is essential but broken—skip condition insufficient for all nestings, extra fill only vertical (causes most errors in trains); fix diagonals and add horizontal fills.
 * handle_enclosed_holes is mostly helpful but over-marks shared walls in complex blobs (e.g., train 3 row 4).
 * remove_isolated is helpful and likely correct (no obvious errors), but run early.
 * Overall, pipeline order is good, but functions interfere (e.g., bays after holes mark already-resolved areas).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-marks many 1s as 7s in ways that don't align with training expectations, creating irregular boundaries (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 4 and 7,7,7 at cols 10-12, but looks like an open area that should remain 1s; row 5 has scattered 7s/0s in a blob that expected might keep more 1s per train patterns; row 11 has 7s in row 11 col 4-5 but then 0 at col 6 where it might be a bay center needing 0 but sides not marked right; row 12 has 7,7,0 at cols 4-6, suggesting incomplete double bay handling).
 * Compared to trainings, it misses subtle nestings (e.g., potential vertical bays in cols 6-8 not fully marked/skipped, leading to extra 7s in row 7 col 3=0 but surrounded by 7s); over-marks diagonals inappropriately (e.g., row 8 col 12=0 but adjacent 1s marked 7 where expected might be open).
 * Does not make sense for a cohesive enclosure/bay marking—too many isolated 7s (e.g., row 3 col 13=1 unmarked but should be 7 if bay), and the bottom (rows 12-15) has abrupt 7,0,0 patterns like unresolved double bays; to handle test, need better vertical bay detection and stricter skips, as test seems to have more vertical/nested features than horizontal trainings.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grid processing (0s as background/empty, 1s as foreground/objects) to clean up noise, identify and mark internal boundaries or enclosed "pockets" within connected components of 1s using the value 7, while preserving the overall structure. The goal appears to be morphological-like operations: remove small isolated 1s, then detect and highlight internal edges or fill specific open/near-open holes that are almost enclosed by 1s (e.g., 3-sided pockets), but only in certain orientations or conditions to match subtle enclosure rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prune small components first: Remove 1s with fewer than 2 orthogonal (4-dir) neighbors to eliminate noise or isolated pixels/lines, but only apply this before other steps to avoid altering main structures.
 * Internal boundaries (7s): Placed on 1s adjacent (8-dir) to 0s that are "qualifying" (the 0 has >=3 orthogonal 1-neighbors, indicating near-enclosure), but this must be precise—over-marking happens if not checking for full enclosure or specific topologies; avoid marking outer boundaries or open edges.
 * Open pockets filling: For 0s with exactly 3 orthogonal 1-neighbors (a "pocket" open on one side), fill related areas with 7, but only if the open side is specific (e.g., horizontal for certain cases, or conditional on grid position like below midline); this is orientation-sensitive and may propagate fills horizontally or vertically, but current logic fails on directionality and overfills/underfills.
 * Subtle elements: 7s represent internal/diagonal boundaries or filled holes, but not all holes—only those that are "internal" or "almost closed" (e.g., triply-adjacent 0s); distinguish between fully enclosed 0s (leave as 0) and boundary-adjacent ones; consider grid symmetry/asymmetry (e.g., bottom-heavy fills); process order matters (prune -> fill pockets -> set boundaries) to avoid interfering changes; 8-dir for adjacency checks but 4-dir for neighbor counts; edge cases like diagonal connections, single-pixel holes, or pockets near grid borders; no changes to 0s unless explicitly filling, and 1s only become 7 if internal.
 * Across attempts: No extraction of connected components (e.g., flood-fill to identify blobs) was used, leading to global over-application; missing checks for enclosure topology (e.g., is the 0 part of a larger hole?); propagation in fill_open_pockets is buggy (e.g., only handles vertical opens poorly, ignores horizontal fully); set_internal_boundaries over-marks if not filtering for true internals vs. concavities; prune_small_components works partially but may remove valid small parts if <2 neighbors threshold is too strict for chains.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (varying h/w, but consistent per example); outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving 0s in open areas; test inputs may have asymmetric structures requiring direction-specific rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions show partial understanding but are mostly broken or incomplete—prune_small_components is somewhat helpful for noise removal but applies too broadly (single pass may miss iterative pruning); set_internal_boundaries captures the idea of qualifying 0s but over-applies 7s without topology checks; fill_open_pockets attempts pocket detection but has flawed propagation (e.g., only partial horizontal fill for vertical opens, and arbitrary midline condition); no connected component labeling, which would be essential for isolating objects and checking per-blob enclosures.

No other helpful tools; missing: connected component extraction (e.g., DFS/BFS to label blobs and compute per-blob properties like hole count or boundary type), which would help isolate issues.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) demonstrates partial understanding of noise pruning and internal marking but fails all training examples due to imprecise pocket filling and boundary detection.
 * prune_small_components works for removing isolates but doesn't iteratively prune chains, leading to residual small 1s in some cases (though not the main failure here).
 * set_internal_boundaries over-marks 1s as 7 near any 3+ neighbor 0, causing extra 7s in semi-open areas (e.g., Train1 rows 11-12: generates 7,7,7,7 where expected 7,7,0,7 and 7,0,0,7—fills holes prematurely without checking openness).
 * fill_open_pockets under-detects/under-fills pockets: e.g., Train1 lower structure misses 0s in expected holes (generates solid 7s); Train2 top-right: generates 0 and 1 where expected 7,0 and 7,7 (fails to fill near-edge pocket); Train3 row12: generates 7,7,7 where expected 7,0,7 (overfills a specific internal 0).
 * Order of operations (prune -> fill -> boundaries) is logical but interactions cause errors, like fills altering what boundaries see.
 * No component extraction used, so global rules apply blindly—essential for handling multiple objects separately.
 * Function fill_open_pockets is broken (directional bias, midline hack) and not helpful—avoid or rewrite with better open-side detection.
 * set_internal_boundaries is partially helpful but incorrect for non-fully-enclosed 0s—don't use without enclosure check.
 * Overall, misses subtle topology: e.g., Train1/3 have specific 0s preserved inside near-holes, but attempt fills them; Train2 edge pockets need vertical fills upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in what seem like internal areas of a large blob (e.g., rows 4-11 show 7s in concavities), but it does not look fully correct: overfills some pockets (e.g., row5 col5: 0 where likely should be 7 or preserved based on enclosure, but hard to tell without expected; compares to training patterns, it solidifies areas like row7 col3:0 which may be an open pocket needing partial 7); underfills edges (e.g., row2 col10-12:7,7,7 but if analogous to Train2, might need more/less); structure has asymmetric 7s (e.g., left-heavy in rows 6-8) that may ignore horizontal propagation rules seen in failures. It partially makes sense for a connected blob but mismatches training subtleties (e.g., preserves some 0s incorrectly inside, like row6 col5:0), suggesting same bugs as training—likely incorrect due to over-marking internals without precise openness checks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a binary grid (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the grid by removing isolated 1s, identifying and marking specific "bay" or "hole" patterns (like enclosed areas or protrusions) with 7s, and applying rules iteratively to simulate filling or elimination in something akin to a Battleship-style puzzle or contour-filling game.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero 1-neighbors in 4 directions) at the start and end to clean up single-cell artifacts not connected to larger structures.
 * Handle enclosed holes: Mark 1s around a 0 fully surrounded by 1s in 4 directions (and optionally diagonals) as 7s, treating it as a filled interior; use 8 directions for broader marking but check diagonals strictly for confirmation.
 * Double horizontal bays: Detect two adjacent 0s in a row, each with exactly 3 1-neighbors, and mark surrounding 1s (including below and sides) as 7s if they form a bay-like indentation; skip or increment carefully to avoid overlap.
 * Double vertical bays: Similar to horizontal but for columns; check for matching open directions (left or right only) and mark adjacent 1s, including perpendicular sides; requires identifying the open side consistently.
 * L-bays: For a 0 with exactly two adjacent 1s in non-opposite directions (forming an L), mark those 1s and the diagonal corner as 7s.
 * Single bays: For a 0 with exactly three 1-neighbors (one open side), mark the three 1s as 7s unless the open side leads to another bay (skip to avoid chaining); additionally, fill diagonal or perpendicular extensions if they are isolated or 1s, and conditionally fill the open center 0 if no perpendicular empty neighbors have 1s.
 * Subtleties: Use 4-directional neighbors for most counts (up/down/left/right) but 8 for some fillings; avoid over-marking by checking original grid 'g' vs. working 'out'; iterate carefully (e.g., while loops with increments) to handle adjacent patterns without missing/skipping; open directions must align for vertical bays (only left/right, not up/down); do not fill if patterns nest or chain infinitely; apply removals before and after other handlers to propagate changes.
 * Easy to miss: Syntax errors from inline comments or incomplete loops break everything; duplicated functions (e.g., two remove_isolated); inconsistent indexing (e.g., using 'c' for rows); unhandled edge cases like grid boundaries or zero-size grids; marking only if original is 1, not propagated 7s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_num_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is a solid, reusable helper for counting 4-directional 1-neighbors; essential for bay detection and isolation checks.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if 0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and g[i + di][j + dj] == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This works for removing isolated 1s based on original grid; apply early and late in pipeline. The duplicate 'remove_remaining_isolated' is identical and unneeded—consolidate.)

(No other functions from this attempt are particularly helpful yet, as most are broken or overly specific.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it attempts to cover core rules like isolation removal, hole filling, and bay types (single, L, double horizontal/vertical), showing some understanding of pattern detection via neighbor counts and directions.
 * What worked: Conceptual structure (pipeline of handlers), get_num_one_neighbors function is correct and reusable, basic isolation removal logic is sound (though duplicated), and intent to mark with 7s for patterns matches puzzle goals.
 * What didn't work: Severe syntax errors (e.g., line 74 in handle_double_horizontal_bays has malformed code like "if g[c // wait no, for r in range(rows-1), for c in range(1, cols-1?" with inline comments and incomplete loops, causing total execution failure); inconsistent loop structures (while loops with bad increments in horizontal/vertical bays); unhandled edge cases in single_bays (e.g., potential index errors in diagonal fills); no testing or validation, leading to all examples (training 1-3 and test) failing with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 74)".
 * Missed proper loop syntax and variable scoping (e.g., 'c' used ambiguously in horizontal bays); overcomplicated vertical bays with redundant r-increments; L_bays skips opposites correctly but doesn't handle all rotations; single_bays has good skip logic for chaining but buggy conditional fills (e.g., assumes open_i without full bounds checks).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob detection or component labeling), which might help identify connected 1s but isn't essential here—focus on local patterns instead.
 * All handlers modify 'out' in place based on original 'g', which is good for non-destructive checks, but propagation (e.g., re-running after marks) is missing beyond final isolation.
 * Training examples 1-3 and test all failed identically due to syntax, so no observed outputs to compare—expected grids with marked 7s in bays/holes and cleaned isolations, but got nothing runnable.
 * Functions like handle_double_horizontal_bays and handle_double_vertical_bays are broken due to syntax/loops (don't reuse without full rewrite); handle_enclosed_holes and handle_L_bays are closer but untested; handle_single_bays is overly verbose with repeated bounds checks (simplify).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so it does not make sense or run at all—nothing is generated, which is completely incorrect as the puzzle requires a processed grid with 0s, 1s, and 7s marking resolved patterns.
 * Without execution, we can't observe effects, but based on code intent, it would likely over-mark or miss bays if fixed (e.g., horizontal bays loop is garbled, so adjacent double 0s might be skipped entirely); differs from expected by not producing any grid—expected: isolated 1s removed, enclosed 0s' surroundings marked 7, bays filled appropriately without chaining errors.
 * No way to confirm if it handles test-specific subtleties (e.g., edge bays or nested patterns) since it crashes; prioritize fixing syntax and adding print/debug for grid states to verify.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a binary grid (0s for empty space, 1s for shape pixels) to detect and outline boundaries of enclosed regions, holes, or "dents" (openings) in connected components of 1s by marking relevant boundary 1s with 7, while leaving internal 1s as 1, external/open areas as 0, and removing isolated 1s. The goal appears to be highlighting the "edges" or walls around fully enclosed voids or partially open indentations in shapes, with special rules for different orientations and configurations of openings to avoid over- or under-marking.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Start by removing isolated 1s (those with zero 4-directional neighbors that are 1), as they are noise and not part of meaningful shapes.
 * For fully enclosed 0s (a 0 cell surrounded by 1s on all four cardinal directions), mark all eight surrounding 1s (if present) as 7 to outline internal holes.
 * Handle "dents" or openings in shapes: These are 0 cells adjacent to 1s but not fully enclosed, requiring orientation-specific logic (upward-open, downward-open, left-open, right-open, bottom-horizontal). For example, upward dents (open top, closed bottom/left/right) should mark the bottom wall and sides; downward dents need to consider wall lengths (min of left/right) to decide if the dent floor or ceiling gets marked (e.g., if short walls <=3, mark the dent cell itself; if longer, mark above).
 * Subtleties include: Using 4-connectivity for neighbor counts in enclosures but 8-connectivity for marking around them; avoiding marking external boundaries or open exteriors; handling edge cases like grid borders (treat as open/0); preventing over-marking where dents connect to larger openings; for bottom-horizontal dents, mark only if above is open and below is closed, focusing on horizontal walls and 3-wide below; left/right dents mark 3-neighbor 0s missing one side; do not mark entire shapes, only boundaries around voids/dents; iterations may be needed if markings affect later detections, but current code does sequential passes without re-checking.
 * Across attempts, consider connected components: Shapes may have multiple holes/dents; markings should not propagate to unrelated areas; subtle element: Some dents require measuring arm lengths (e.g., left/right wall continuity) to decide marking depth; avoid marking 1s that are internal to solid areas; grid may have multiple disconnected objects, so process globally but locally per cell.
 * Other considerations: No diagonal-only connections count as neighbors for enclosure (use 4-dir); after marking, original 1s in non-boundary positions stay 1; 0s stay 0 unless they're part of a dent that gets filled/marked (but code doesn't fill, only marks adjacent 1s); potential for cascading effects if dents are adjacent.

        return g[r][c]
    return 0
```
(This safe grid accessor is essential for boundary checks without index errors.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1:
                n_up = get(g, i - 1, j)
                n_down = get(g, i + 1, j)
                n_left = get(g, i, j - 1)
                n_right = get(g, i, j + 1)
                n1 = (1 if n_up == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_down == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_left == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_right == 1 else 0)
                if n1 == 0:
                    result[i][j] = 0
    return result
```
(This correctly removes single isolated 1s using 4-connectivity and works in all examples.)

```python
def color_enclosed_boundaries(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs8 = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

                n1 = (1 if n_up == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_down == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_left == 1 else 0) + (1 if n_right == 1 else 0)
                if n1 == 4:
                    for dr, dc in dirs8:
                        ni = i + dr
                        nj = j + dc
                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and g[ni][nj] == 1:
                            result[ni][nj] = 7
    return result
```
(This identifies and marks around fully enclosed 0s correctly for internal holes, using 4-dir enclosure but 8-dir marking; helpful but may need to run after other steps if dents create enclosures.)

(The dent-handling functions like handle_open_up_dents, handle_open_down_dents, etc., are attempts at orientation-specific logic but are broken/incomplete: e.g., handle_open_down_dents over-marks ceilings for long walls and mishandles short ones; handle_open_left_dents and handle_open_right_dents use simplistic 3-neighbor checks but fail on asymmetric openings; handle_bottom_horizontal_dents incorrectly assumes open above for all cases and over-marks horizontals; these are not helpful in current form and should be revised or replaced with more robust dent detection, perhaps using flood-fill for openness or component analysis. No extraction of full objects/components was attempted, which could help by isolating shapes before boundary detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a sequential pipeline: remove isolated, color enclosed, then handle various dents; this correctly removes isolates and marks some internal holes but fails overall due to flawed dent logic.
 * What worked: remove_isolated properly clears lone 1s (e.g., no extras in Train 1 row 15); color_enclosed_boundaries catches some holes (e.g., marks the 7s around the 0 in Train 1 rows 4-5 correctly).
 * What didn't: Dent handlers over-mark or under-mark boundaries; e.g., in Train 1, generated marks rows 7-9 fully with 7s (including where expected is all 0s), and row 10 has extra 7s in cols 5-7 instead of expected 7s only in col 5; row 11 expected has 0s in cols 6-7 but generated has 7s; bottom rows (16-18) generated has scattered 7s/1s where expected has structured 7s around a 0; unknown why row 18 col 16 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected.
 * In Train 2, generated over-marks large areas with 7s (e.g., rows 3-5 cols 5-13 all 7s, but expected has 0s there initially, with 7s only in specific dent spots like row 6 cols 13-15); row 9 has extra 7s in cols 2-6; row 10 has 7s where expected 0s; row 13 has 7 in col 8 but expected 0; row 14 has extra 0s in cols 6-8.
 * In Train 3, generated prematurely marks upper empty areas with 7s (e.g., row 1 all 0s expected but has scattered 7s/0s; rows 2-4 have extra 7s around non-existent shapes); row 4 col 4 is 7 but expected 0; lower parts like row 12 expected has 7s in cols 6-8 but generated has them in row 13; overall, it fills voids too aggressively without checking openness.
 * No object extraction attempted, which would help isolate shapes and detect per-component dents/holes; current global cell-by-cell scanning causes spillover between objects.
 * Function handle_open_down_dents is particularly unhelpful/broken: It always marks below 3-wide and mishandles min_len logic (e.g., marks center for <=3 but over-marks above for >3 incorrectly in Train 1); avoid reusing without fix.
 * All handlers ignore potential iteration (e.g., after marking one dent, re-scan for new enclosures); this misses chained effects.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-marks large horizontal strips of 7s (e.g., rows 1-3 cols 5-10 all 7s, suggesting it treated an open area as enclosed); row 4 has 7s in cols 5-6 and 10-12 but leaves col 7 as 1 (internal), which might be partial but expected likely needs more precise dent outlining without filling solids; row 5 has 0 in col 5 but 7s around, possibly missing a left-dent mark; rows 11-12 have 7s in cols 5-7 but 0 in row 12 col 6, inconsistent with expected boundary rules; bottom rows 13-15 all 0s after 7s, but test input has solid 1s at top, so likely under-marking external dents or over-removing isolates incorrectly (no isolates visible in input). Overall, it resembles the training failures with excessive 7 strips, missing subtle open dent boundaries (e.g., the jagged shape on right likely needs targeted 7s around its opening, not full rows); does not make sense as it turns solid areas into boundaries without voids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0s for empty, 1s for filled cells) where the goal is to process the input to remove isolated 1s and then identify and mark specific enclosed or patterned regions by changing certain 1s to 7s, likely to highlight boundaries, fills, or shapes like loops, bays, or internal areas. The output preserves the overall structure but annotates detectable features, with 7s indicating processed or filled elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Remove isolated 1s (those with zero orthogonal neighbors) by setting them to 0, as they don't form part of larger structures.
 * For 0 cells (empty spaces), detect surrounding 1s in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) to identify enclosures: full surround (4 neighbors) fills all eight surrounding cells with 7 if they are 1s; 3 neighbors indicate an open bay, filling closed sides and interior/exterior based on open direction, with conditions for low-adjacency cells; 2 neighbors handle corner-like or L-shaped opens by filling specific adjacent 1s.
 * Subtlety in 3-neighbor case: Interior fill is always 3 cells in the closed direction, but exterior/open-side fill only applies if the open-side cell is internal (0) and has <2 neighbors, or if already 1 (always fill); this prevents overfilling unbounded areas.
 * Subtlety in 2-neighbor case: Only specific diagonal pairs of neighbors (e.g., left+down but not up+right) trigger fills of 3-cell L-shapes, ignoring other configurations like straight lines or opposites.
 * Process in a single pass over 0 cells, using mutable out grid; order matters as changes affect later checks (top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
 * No diagonal neighbor checks for isolation or basic adjacency—only orthogonal for core logic, but eight directions for some fills.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 17x17, 16x16, 16x16), with many empty rows/columns; preserve all 0s unless part of a pattern fill.
 * 7s seem to mark "claimed" or boundary/interior cells without removing them, suggesting annotation rather than erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Conditional fills in open directions only apply to low-adjacency 0s (<2 neighbors) to avoid filling unrelated empty space; also, is_internal check limits open-side fills.
 * No handling for num_1 == 1 or 0 cases explicitly beyond isolation removal.
 * Potential overreach: Code modifies 1s to 7s even if not enclosed, based on local 0-cell views, which can propagate incorrectly in complex shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_neighbor(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, di: int, dj: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    ni = i + di
    nj = j + dj
    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
        return g[ni][nj]
    return 0
```
(This is useful for safe boundary-checked neighbor access, used in isolation and pattern detection.)

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if out[i][j] == 1:
                num_adj = sum(1 for di, dj in directions if get_neighbor(out, i, j, di, dj) == 1)
                if num_adj == 0:
                    out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This correctly removes isolated 1s based on orthogonal neighbors and is likely working well, as no differences noted in isolations across examples.)

The handle_patterns function is partially helpful for enclosure detection but broken in specifics (see below); no extraction of full objects/shapes yet, which might be needed for global context like connected components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements isolated 1 removal, which works as no isolated 1s appear in generated outputs where they shouldn't.
 * Pattern handling partially works for some full enclosures (num_1==4), as seen in training 1 where top-left and bottom shapes have some 7 fills matching expected, but fails on partial opens (num_1==3/2), leading to under/over-filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated has extra 1s in row 11 (positions 5-6 should be 7 and 0 per expected, but are 0 and 0—underfilled); row 12 has 7,1,1 instead of 7,7,7 (underfilled interior); row 13 all 1s except expected has 7s in positions 4-7 (missed horizontal fill); row 14 has extra 7s in positions 7-8 (overfilled where expected is all 1s); bottom shape in rows 16-17 matches expected fills.
 * Training example 2: Generated incorrectly fills row 2 with 1s where expected has 1s but misses some 7s (e.g., positions 1-2 should be 1s but code put 7s? Wait, row 2 is [1,7,7,1,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,...]—overfilled early); row 5 has 7,7,0 vs expected 0,0,0 (overfilled sides); row 10 has 1,1,0 vs expected 1,1,0 (matches but later mismatches); row 12 all 1s vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (minor); row 13 has 7,0,0 vs expected 7,7,7,7 (underfilled); overall, code detects some vertical fills but misses horizontal enclosures and overfills bays.
 * Training example 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 3 position 6 with 7 (isolated? but expected 0); row 4 has 1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1 (overfilled); row 7 has 1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7 (mismatch in positions 11-12: 7,0 vs 0,7—shifted fill); row 8 similar shift; row 9 has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1 vs expected 1,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1 (underfilled position 6); bottom rows match expected fills, suggesting vertical patterns work better than horizontal.
 * No object extraction function present, which might help identify connected 1-components for global enclosure detection instead of local 0-cell checks.
 * The 2-neighbor logic only handles specific L-shapes but misses straight or opposite pairs, leading to underfilling in linear opens (e.g., training 2 row 13 underfill).
 * Single pass mutation causes order-dependent errors, like early fills affecting later num_1 counts (unknown if this caused specific mismatches, but likely in complex shapes).
 * No reversal or iterative passes, so partial fills don't propagate (e.g., training 1 row 12 underfill).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7s in ways that suggest partial enclosure detection (e.g., vertical fills in columns 4-5 rows 2-12 look like bay handling, horizontal in row 4-5), but it does not look fully correct—many areas seem underfilled or overfilled compared to likely expected (based on training patterns), such as row 5 having 7,7,7,1,... which might overfill an open area, and row 9-10 having scattered 7s in a dense 1 block that expected might keep more as 1s for unprocessed shapes.
 * Missing fills in bottom-left enclosure (rows 10-12, columns 5-7 should likely have more 7s for interior if it's a bay, but has 7,0,7—underfilled like training 3).
 * Overfills in row 2 position 4 with 7 where it might be open (similar to training 2 overfill); right-side 7s in rows 2-10 column 10 seem correct for a separate shape, but without expected, hard to confirm—however, inconsistencies with training suggest it's not handling mixed horizontal/vertical opens well.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates the same flaws as trainings (local over/under-fills), so it likely doesn't match expected; needs better global shape detection to avoid local errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a binary grid where 1s represent land or solid structures and 0s represent empty space or water, and the goal is to "clean" the grid by removing invalid or protruding land pixels while identifying and marking enclosed bays, holes, or inland features (surrounded by 3+ sides of land) with 7s to highlight them, preserving borders and certain connected structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has borders that must be preserved (1s on edges shouldn't be removed), and cleaning only applies to internal (non-border) 1s with <=1 neighbor or 2 non-opposite neighbors (e.g., not straight lines like up-down [dirs 0,1] or left-right [2,3]).
 * Bays/holes are 0s surrounded by >=3 land neighbors (using 4-directional for enclosure check, but 8-directional for marking adjacent 1s); for exactly 3 neighbors, detect the single open direction and conditionally fill/mark 1s in that direction if the open cell has <2 land neighbors (simple bay) or handle "double" cases by marking center and far-side extensions.
 * Subtle elements: For 3-neighbor 0s, the open direction must lead to a truly open 0 (not land), and filling is 3-wide strips perpendicular to the direction (e.g., horizontal strip for vertical open); for open_num1==2, mark vertically/horizontally extended far sides (2 steps away, 3-wide). Avoid over-marking—only mark 1s adjacent to the hole/bay. Holes can be multi-cell (e.g., L-shapes or larger enclosures need full filling). Process in passes if needed, but current code does single pass. Border 1s are immune to cleaning/marking changes. Grids can have disconnected components or vertical/horizontal symmetries that require direction-specific logic. Miss easy cases like single-pixel protrusions or diagonal bays. Expected outputs show 7s only on former 1s that form bay walls, not on 0s; 0s remain 0 unless part of a fill (but code marks 1s to 7, not 0s).
 * Considerations across attempts: Direction indexing (dirs4: 0=up,1=down,2=left,3=right) is crucial for opposite checks and filling strips. Use 8-dirs for broad neighbor marking but 4-dirs for enclosure count. Handle vertical vs. horizontal opens separately for far-side marking. Code assumes rectangular grids; no rotation or non-1/0 values. Iterative cleaning/marking may be needed for nested bays, but examples suggest single pass suffices if logic is right. Preserve all original 0s and non-marked 1s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_num_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This 4-dir neighbor count is essential for enclosure detection and cleaning rules.)

```python
def clean_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if new_g[r][c] == 1 and not (r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1):
                one_dirs = []
                for i, (dr, dc) in enumerate(dirs4):
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and new_g[nr][nc] == 1:
                        one_dirs.append(i)
                num1 = len(one_dirs)
                if num1 <= 1 or (num1 == 2 and sorted(one_dirs) not in [[0, 1], [2, 3]]):
                    new_g[r][c] = 0
    return new_g
```
(This partially works for removing invalid internal 1s but may over-remove in complex shapes; useful as a preprocessing step.)

(The `handle_bays_and_holes` function is an attempt at marking but is broken—see below; no extraction functions were provided, but one could be added to identify connected components of 0s for better hole detection, e.g., flood-fill to find enclosed areas.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt's clean_grid works partially (correctly removes some protrusions in train 1 rows 4-5 and train 2 cols 2-13, preserving borders and straight lines) but fails to remove nothing in train 3 (leading to near-empty output) and over-removes or misses in bays (e.g., train 1 row 3 keeps 1s at cols 7-9 that should stay but get marked later).
 * handle_bays_and_holes correctly identifies some 3+ neighbor 0s and marks adjacent 1s to 7 (e.g., train 1 top bay at row0 col2, row1 cols2-4; train 2 bottom at row13 cols5-8) but misses nested/complex fills: in train 1, fails to mark row3 cols7-9 to 7, row4 cols7-10 to 7/0/7, row5 cols7-9 to 7, and entire lower structure (rows9-13 cols5-7); also incorrectly marks row1 col15-16 as 7s (should be 1s) and leaves row16 col16 as 0 (should be 7? wait, expected has 7 there but generated doesn't).
 * In train 2, misses filling inner land-like structure (rows5-9 cols6-11 should be partial 1s turning to 7s, but generated leaves as 0s or partial 7s only at edges like row5 col13-15); incorrectly marks row0 col15 as 0 (expected 7) and row8 col15 as 0 (expected 7), and row9 col15 as 7 but adjacent wrong.
 * Train 3 is a total failure: generated almost all 0s (only row4 col15=1), missing the entire vertical structure (rows4-13 cols4-15 with 7s in bays like row5 col9-11, row6 col11, etc.); likely because cleaning removes the thin structure incorrectly or hole detection skips due to border proximity/openness.
 * No object extraction function was attempted, which would help identify connected 0-components for true enclosures (e.g., flood-fill from borders to distinguish inland holes); current neighbor-based detection misses multi-cell bays.
 * The 3-neighbor open direction logic works for simple cases (e.g., train 1 top) but breaks on open_num1==2 (far-side marking doesn't trigger properly, e.g., train 2 inner) and doesn't handle len(open_dirs)>1 or diagonal opens.
 * Single-pass processing misses iterative needs, like marking one bay exposing another.
 * Function `handle_bays_and_holes` is broken for complex/nested cases and over-marks borders (don't use as-is; needs refinement for open_dir filling strips and far-side logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially captures cleaning (removes protrusions in rows0-2 cols5-15 and row11-15 cols5-15 correctly as 0s) and some bay marking (e.g., row7 cols11-13=7s for a small enclosure, row8-10 cols10-12=7/0/7 pattern), but it does not look fully correct: misses marking larger bays like row5 col5-6 should lead to filling row6 col4? (hard to tell without expected, but based on patterns, likely needs 7s around row6-7 cols3-5 enclosure and row4 col13-15); incorrectly leaves row7 col15=0 (probably should be 1 or 7 if bay wall) and row9 col13=7 but adjacent row8 col13=1 (inconsistent with expected bay fills); the bottom structure row15 col15=1 is preserved but may need 7s if it's a bay wall. Overall, it under-marks enclosures (e.g., the L-shape at rows6-10 cols3-13 likely needs more 7s in the inner corner) and fails to handle the test's vertical thin connections similar to train 3's failure. This suggests the code detects simple 3-sided bays but misses multi-cell or directionally complex ones, making the output incomplete.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based shape processing, where the goal is to identify and mark (with 7) or remove (to 0) specific structural elements like thin protrusions, low-connectivity cells, or boundary configurations in binary shapes made of 1s, while preserving the core body of objects. The output grid modifies the input by highlighting removable or noise-like parts (7s) and sometimes erasing them, likely to isolate main shapes or clean up artifacts in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are composed of 1s on a 0 background; 7s seem to indicate cells targeted for removal or highlighting, often in thin arms, corners, or isolated extensions, but not the solid core.
 * Low-connectivity removal: Cells with 0 or 1 adjacent 1 (in 4 directions) should be removed early to prune isolated points or tips.
 * Thin protrusions: Cells surrounded by >=3 non-1s (edges or 0s) in 4 directions are likely noise and should be set to 0, but this must happen after initial marking to avoid over-removal.
 * Boundary scanning from 0 cells: Analyze adjacent 1s from empty spaces; configurations like single adjacent 1 (e.g., vertical chains of exactly 3 empty above a rightward protrusion) or 2-3 adjacent 1s (opposites for lines, L-shapes, or corners) trigger marking of nearby 1s to 7, but skip if the open side leads to a high-connectivity empty cell (e.g., >=2 or ==3 neighbors).
 * Directional exclusions: For horizontal/vertical lines or corners, exclude marking upward if the open side is rightward to avoid over-marking vertical extensions.
 * 8-adjacency marking: When marking from L or corner configs, use 8 directions but sometimes exclude up; this catches diagonal protrusions but risks over-marking if not conditioned on openness.
 * Second pass: After thin removal, re-scan for remaining 1s adjacent via single direction (non-up/down) and mark the adjacent 1 to 7 if it's a lingering tip.
 * Subtleties: Horizontal vs. vertical handling differs (e.g., mark 3 cells right for horizontals, down for verticals); chain lengths matter (e.g., exactly 3 empty above for specific protrusions); avoid marking solid bodies (e.g., skip if open side has >1 neighbor 1s); empty rows/columns separate objects, and processing must not bleed across them.
 * Over-removal risk: Functions like remove_low_connect can erase valid cores if applied too early; thin removal after marking helps, but mis-marking leads to chain reactions.
 * Under-marking: Complex shapes with internal 0s or diagonals may miss L/corner detections if neighbor counts aren't 8-way in some checks.
 * Grid boundaries: Always check bounds to avoid index errors, treating out-of-bounds as 0 (non-1).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a multi-pass approach (low-connect removal, config-based marking from 0s, thin protrusion removal, second marking) which partially captures boundary detection but fails on specifics like chain lengths and directional marking.
 * Worked: Basic pruning of low-connect and thin parts; 4/8-dir neighbor logic identifies some L/corners and opposites for lines; marking some protrusions to 7 in simple cases (e.g., rightward arms in Train 1).
 * Didn't work: Over-marking solid areas (e.g., in Train 1 row 5, generated sets [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] but expected keeps more 1s like [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] with differences in later rows; unknown why row 1 col 16 is 1 in generated vs 7 expected). In Train 1, row 6 has all 0s generated but expected [0s with 7s in cols 7-9]; this suggests thin removal erased marked areas prematurely or marking missed a horizontal extension.
 * Train 2: Generated marks too many 7s early (e.g., row 2 [1,7,7,7,1,...] vs expected all 1s [1,1,1,1,1,...]), over-pruning a solid top bar; row 5 has [1,7,0,0,...] but expected [1,1,0,0,...] with later 1s turned to 7s—missed shifting marking down for vertical parts; row 13 generated [1,1,1,1,1,7,7,...] but expected same with more 7s in cols 6-8, indicating under-marking of a bottom protrusion.
 * Train 3: Major failure—generated marks internal parts of a single shape (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,...] but expected [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,...] with 7s only in specific cols 9-11; row 7 [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,0,7,0,...] vs expected similar but 7s in cols 9-11 and 13; row 13 all 0s generated vs expected [0s,7s in cols 6-8]). This shows over-marking of core (e.g., treating inner Ls as protrusions) and missing preservation of main body; thin removal likely wiped marked but connected areas.
 * Config detection bugs: Num==1 only handles rightward with exact 3-up chain, missing other singles; num==2 opposites mark inconsistently (e.g., vertical marks down 3 but not always adjacent); num==3 skips if open empty has ==3 neighbors, but may false-positive on diagonals; L-shape skip condition (both opens empty with <=1 neighbor) is too strict, leading to under-marking.
 * No object extraction function; all processing is global scan, which works for separated shapes but fails on interconnected ones without per-object isolation.
 * The second marking pass is underused—only catches single-dir tips but misses after thin removal changes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it marks excessive 7s in what seems a complex shape with arms (e.g., rows 4-9 show heavy 7-marking in cols 10-14 like [7,0,7,7,0] in row 4, but based on patterns from training, cores should preserve more 1s—e.g., expected might keep row 4 as more 1s with targeted 7s only on tips, similar to Train 1's partial matches).
 * Top rows 0-2 all 1s preserved (good, likely solid bar), but row 3 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,7,0,0] marks a right protrusion to 7/0, which may be correct if thin, but row 5 [1,1,1,7,7,0,7,1,...] inserts 0s and 7s oddly—likely over-removal of a diagonal or bend, unlike expected clean marking in similar Train 3 bends.
 * Bottom rows 10-15 show under-marking (e.g., row 11 [1,1,1,1,1,7,0,7,1,...] has isolated 0/7, but training suggests vertical extensions should mark down 3 consistently without gaps); row 12 all low 1s then 0s may miss a bottom arm.
 * Overall, it partially prunes but creates fragmented 7/0 patterns that don't align with training expectations of targeted tip-marking without core erosion; unclear why cols 11-12 have many 0s (perhaps thin removal over-applied post-marking), but it looks noisy rather than clean.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary image processing on a grid of 0s (background/empty) and 1s (foreground/objects), where the goal is to clean up noise by removing small connected components of 1s, identify and fill small enclosed holes (internal 0-regions not connected to the border background) by dilating their boundaries to 7s, and handle isolated border 0s similarly as small holes. The output modifies the original grid: small 1-components become 0s, small holes get dilated boundaries marked as 7s (while keeping hole interiors as 0s), and larger structures remain intact.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), not diagonal.
 * Background 0s are all 0-regions reachable from the grid borders via flood-fill; any internal 0s not reachable are enclosed holes.
 * Small 1-components are defined as size <2 (single isolated 1s), which get set to 0; larger 1-groups (size >=2) are preserved as objects.
 * Small holes are enclosed 0-components of size <=3, plus any single isolated 0s on the border; these are not filled entirely but dilated: surrounding pixels (3x3 neighborhood, excluding the hole itself) are set to 7 to "highlight" or expand the boundary.
 * Dilation for holes only affects non-hole pixels (e.g., 1s become 7s); hole pixels stay 0.
 * Border single 0s are treated as small holes even if connected to background, but only if truly isolated (no adjacent 0s).
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected objects, varying sizes, and holes of different scales; larger holes (>3) are left as 0s without dilation.
 * Bottom rows or edges may have partial structures or all-0 lines that should not be altered unless they qualify as small components/holes.
 * Subtle: In get_background_positions, ensure flood-fill starts only from border 0s and marks all reachable 0s; enclosed 0s are the complement.
 * Subtle: In dilation, the 3x3 kernel around each small hole pixel should union across the component, but avoid overwriting hole 0s.
 * Subtle: After removing small 1s, re-evaluate holes on the original grid (not the cleaned one) to avoid altering hole detection.
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s that are single but adjacent to 1s might need special handling; also, holes touching borders aren't enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: In get_zero_components, it operates only on enclosed set, but assumes enclosed positions are valid; rows/cols inferred from max coords may fail if enclosed is empty.
 * Consideration: Outputs use 7 for dilated boundaries, 0 for holes/interiors/background, 1 for preserved objects; no other values.
 * All processing should preserve grid dimensions and non-qualifying pixels unchanged.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it implements core logic for small 1-removal and small hole dilation but fails all training examples due to incorrect hole identification and dilation placement.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly dilates some areas (e.g., row 3 col 7-9 missing 7s, row 4 col 7=0 but expected 7, row 5 col 7-9=7 but expected 0 in hole? Wait, differences in hole dilation: generated has extra 7s in row 16-17 and misses 7s in row 12 col 7, row 16 col 13-15=0 but expected 7s; also row 4 col 16=7 expected 7 but surrounding mismatch; unknown why dilation skips some boundaries.
 * Train 2: Generated adds unwanted 7s (e.g., row 8 col 13=1 but expected 1? Wait, row 8 col 13=0 expected 0, but row 9 col 13=1 expected 1, main issue: misses dilation in row 6 col 13-15=7 expected 7 but row 9 col 13=1 instead of expected 1? Differences: generated has row 6 col 13=0 but expected 7? No, row 6: generated [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] vs expected [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,7,7] - match? Wait, actual diff in row 15? Generated misses some 7s in lower parts; unknown, but border handling wrong as row 0 col 14=7 expected 7 but propagation fails.
 * Train 3: Generated incorrectly removes a small 1 in row 3 col 6=1 (sets to 0, but expected preserved? No, expected row 3 all 0s, but generated has it; main: misses dilation entirely in lower object (rows 11-13 expected 7s around hole at row 12 col 7=0, but generated has no 7s there, keeps all 1s; also row 13 col 6=0 expected 0 but no dilation; upper hole dilation partial, e.g., row 5 col 9-11=7 expected 7 but row 7 col 11=0 expected 0 match, but lower fails completely.
 * remove_small_components works for isolating noise but applied too early, before hole detection on original.
 * get_background_positions seems correct but may miss if borders have 1s blocking.
 * get_border_single_zeros is broken/not helpful: it checks isolation but enqueues only borders and marks visited prematurely, leading to missing some singles; also overlaps with background flood-fill, causing double-counting or skips.
 * dilate_small_holes is partially helpful but flawed: it unions 3x3 around holes and sets non-hole to 7, but in examples, it over-dilates (e.g., Train 1 row 1 col 3-4=7 expected 7 match but extends wrongly) or under-dilates (Train 3 lower hole untouched); doesn't exclude background 0s properly, and to_change includes holes themselves sometimes.
 * get_zero_components helpful but assumes enclosed from original grid; in program, enclosed computed on original g, good, but rows/cols from max may be inaccurate if grid larger.
 * Overall: Program structure good (clean 1s first, find holes on original, dilate), but border singles mishandled, dilation kernel applies to wrong pixels (e.g., sets some 0s to 7 incorrectly), and small hole threshold <=3 includes border singles but logic buggy.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies dilation to what seems a large internal hole (rows 4-10, cols 4-10 area with 0s turned to 7 boundaries), but over-dilates into the left 1-structure (e.g., row 4 col 4=7 but likely should be 1 if part of large object) and misses potential small holes elsewhere (e.g., row 11 col 6=0 isolated? but no 7 around it; also right side row 4 col 12=1 expected preserved but if small, removed? Unknown without expected, but looks like it treats a medium hole as small, adding 7s in row 7 col 3=0? Wait, generated has 7s in unexpected places like row 7 col 11=7 but may be overreach; bottom all-0 rows unchanged good, but upper left 1s dilated wrongly into 7s at row 4 col 4-6. It makes partial sense for one hole but ignores object connectivity, leading to broken shapes.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving binary grids (0 for empty, 1 for filled shapes) where the goal is to detect "cores" (internal holes or enclosed 0s with sufficient surrounding 1s), remove thin or protruding parts of shapes that are not structurally significant, and highlight boundary or adjacent areas around cores with 7 (likely representing dark red outlining or emphasis) while preserving the overall shape integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Cores are strictly defined as 0 cells with at least 3 orthogonal (up/down/left/right) 1 neighbors; diagonal neighbors do not count, and cores must be internal voids, not edge or open spaces.
 * Thin protrusions are 1 cells with fewer than 2 orthogonal 1 neighbors; these should be removed (set to 0) to simplify shapes, but only after core detection, and removals should not override core-adjacent highlighting.
 * Highlighting with 7 occurs around cores using 8-directional neighbors (including diagonals), but skips other cores and prioritizes setting 1s or low-connectivity 0s to 7; however, this must integrate with protrusion removal—e.g., a thin protrusion near a core might stay as 1 or get set to 7 instead of 0.
 * Subtlety: Highlighting applies to the original grid, but final output overrides thin removals only if not already set to 7, which can lead to incomplete outlining if thin parts are not reconsidered post-highlighting.
 * Grids have varying sizes but consistent structure (e.g., multiple disconnected shapes or "objects"); processing must handle all independently without assuming connectivity.
 * 7s form outlines or "dark red" borders around holes/cores, but only on non-core cells; avoid setting cores themselves or isolated 0s to 7 unless they meet low-connectivity criteria.
 * Easy to miss: Orthogonal-only for core detection and protrusion removal, but 8-directional for highlighting spread; also, protrusion removal uses the original grid, not an iterative process, which can miss chained thins.
 * Integration order matters: Detect cores first on original, remove thins separately, then apply highlighting, and finally reconcile (e.g., keep thin removals as 0 unless highlighting sets to 7).
 * No changes to existing 0s unless they are near cores and low-connectivity; shapes should remain mostly 1s except for removals and highlights.
 * Potential for multiple cores per shape; highlighting must not overlap destructively or fill holes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from copy import deepcopy

def num_ortho_ones(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    directions: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni = i + di
        nj = j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is helpful for core detection and protrusion checks, as it correctly counts only orthogonal 1 neighbors.)

```python
def identify_cores(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return set()
    cols = len(grid[0])
    cores: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) >= 3:
                cores.add((i, j))
    return cores
```
(This accurately identifies core positions and is essential for targeting highlighting.)

```python
def remove_thin_protrusions(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(grid[0])
    out = deepcopy(grid)
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and num_ortho_ones(grid, i, j, rows, cols) < 2:
                out[i][j] = 0
    return out
```
(This is useful for simplifying shapes by removing low-connectivity 1s, but note it is non-iterative and based on original grid.)

```python
def get_neighbor_deltas() -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    deltas: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if di != 0 or dj != 0:
                deltas.append((di, dj))
    return deltas
```
(This provides 8-directional neighbors for highlighting spread around cores, which is key for outlining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly handled training example 3 (full match, demonstrating core detection and basic highlighting/removal work for simple cases), but failed training 1 and 2 due to incomplete 7 highlighting on certain boundary cells.
 * In training 1, generated output mismatches expected at row 12, column 7 (0-based: position (12,7) is 1 in generated but 7 in expected), and possibly others; this suggests highlighting did not propagate to all adjacent non-thin 1s near cores, leaving part of a core outline as 1 instead of 7.
 * In training 2, generated output mismatches expected in the top rows (e.g., row 0 column 14 is 1 in generated but 7 in expected; row 0 column 15 is 0 in generated but nothing shown, but overall top-right area lacks 7s), and row 8 column 13 is 1 in generated but expected has 7 there; this indicates failure to highlight thin or edge areas near cores in the upper shape.
 * The reconciliation step in program() overrides thin removals to 0 only if not 7, but this missed setting some 1s to 7 in original positions that were thin but core-adjacent (e.g., should prioritize 7 over removal in borders).
 * Core detection worked (as seen in correct training 3), but set_dark_red_around_holes is incomplete: it sets 7 on 1s or low-ortho 0s near cores, but skips if ortho_count >=2 for 0s, which may miss subtle hole boundaries; also, it uses original grid but doesn't fully integrate with temp_grid removals.
 * remove_thin_protrusions is helpful but non-iterative, potentially leaving pseudo-thin structures if multiple passes are needed (though not evident in examples).
 * No extraction of full objects/shapes was attempted, which might help for disconnected components, but current per-cell approach works for cores; adding object flooding could isolate shapes but isn't necessary yet.
 * The program assumes uniform grid size per row, which holds, but doesn't handle empty grids gracefully beyond basics.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on rules: it correctly identifies a core-like area in the middle-right (e.g., 7s around what seems a hole at ~row 4-11, col 10-12), removes some left-side thins (many 0s on left), and outlines with 7s in 8 directions, but it looks incorrect overall because the large central shape's hole outlining is inconsistent—e.g., row 5 col 5 is 0 (possible thin removal or hole extension) but adjacent 7s suggest incomplete fill/prevention of hole spillover, and top-left shape has no 7s despite potential internal voids.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Expected should have more precise 7 outlining around the evident hole in the bottom-left-ish shape (rows 3-12, cols 0-14), setting 7s on all 8-neighbor borders without leaving isolated 1s inside (e.g., row 7 col 3 is 0 in generated, but if it's a thin near core, it should be 7 or removed consistently); also, right-side protrusions (col 14-15) have scattered 0s that seem over-removed, missing 7 borders.
 * The test output does not fully look correct: It over-applies 0s in thin areas without reconciling to 7 (e.g., row 3 col 13 is 1 but surrounded by 0s, should be removed or highlighted if near core), and the bottom shape (rows 10-12) has 7s that don't close the outline properly, suggesting the highlighting function missed some deltas or low-connectivity checks.
 * To handle test case, need to ensure highlighting scans all core neighbors post-removal and sets 7 on any remaining 1s or adjacent 0s <2 ortho, avoiding the generated's patchy borders.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a binary grid (0s as empty/open spaces, 1s as filled/structural elements) to identify and mark specific patterns like isolated cells, enclosed areas, bays (single/double horizontal/vertical), L-shapes, and edge straights by changing qualifying 1s to 7s (likely indicating "filled" or "boundary" cells), while leaving others as 1 or 0. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected markings for training cases, suggesting rules for detecting connected components, neighbor counts, and directional openness in a maze-like or shape-filling context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules involve neighbor counting in 4 directions (up, down, left, right); 1s with 0 neighbors are isolated and removed (set to 0), while 0s fully surrounded by 1s (4 neighbors) trigger marking adjacent 1s as 7s to "fill" enclosures.
 * Bays are key patterns: single bays (0 with exactly 3 one-neighbors, indicating one open direction) mark the 3 closing 1s as 7s plus specific diagonals; double bays (two adjacent 0s each with 3 one-neighbors) mark sides and sometimes fill centers or extensions, but only if not part of larger opens (e.g., skip if open side leads to another 3-neighbor 0 or straight-line extension).
 * L-bays (0 with exactly 2 non-opposite one-neighbors) mark the two orthogonal 1s and the diagonal between them as 7s; opposites (horizontal or vertical straights) are skipped to avoid false positives.
 * Edge straights handle boundary cases: horizontal 0s on top/bottom with only left/right 1s (no up/down) mark those sides as 7s; vertical on sides mark up/down 1s.
 * Subtleties include directionality (e.g., open direction in single bays determines which diagonals to mark: up/down opens fill horizontal diagonals below/above; left/right fill vertical diagonals right/left); avoiding over-marking by checking if open cell is another bay or straight (e.g., skip single bay if open neighbor has 3 ones or is a horizontal/vertical extension); sequence matters (e.g., remove isolated first, then enclosures, then bays to prevent interference).
 * Vertical double bays require explicit checks for open left/right (e.g., both 0s open right means left/top/bottom 1s marked, right centers filled unless edge); symmetric for left.
 * Easy misses: not skipping overlapping patterns (e.g., double horizontal bay skips by +2 cols to avoid double-count); handling edges/boundaries (no wrap-around, out-of-bounds treated as non-1); potential over-filling in non-edge centers (set to 7 unless bottom/top row); diagonals only in specific bay types, not all; isolated removal happens before marking to clean grid but uses original g for counts.
 * General: Grid sizes vary (e.g., 17x19, 16x16, 16x16); outputs preserve 0s and change only 1s to 7s (no 1 to 0 except isolated); patterns may nest or chain, so order (enclosed > doubles > edges > L > single) is crucial; no rotation/symmetry assumed beyond explicit vertical/horizontal handlers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Useful for consistent 4-dir neighbor checks
opposites = [(0, 1), (2, 3)]  # Indices for horizontal (0=up,1=down) and vertical (2=left,3=right) opposites to skip straights

def count_one_neighbors(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> int:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    count = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count  # Essential for bay/enclosure detection; used across all handlers
```

```python
def remove_isolated(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Copies grid and sets isolated 1s (0 neighbors) to 0; applies early to clean before pattern detection
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == 1 and count_one_neighbors(g, i, j) == 0:
                result[i][j] = 0
    return result  # Helpful for initial cleanup, but ensure it doesn't remove parts of valid patterns
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) partially understands core rules like neighbor counting, isolation removal, and bay detection but fails all training examples due to bugs in pattern skipping, over-marking, and sequence.
 * Worked: remove_isolated correctly cleans stray 1s (e.g., no extras in empty areas); count_one_neighbors is accurate and reusable; basic enclosure marking (handle_enclosed) identifies 4-neighbor 0s but over-marks adjacent 1s without boundary checks.
 * Didn't work: handle_double_horizontal_bays over-marks or misses skips (e.g., in Train1 row1 cols3-4: generates 7s where expected has 0/7 mix; Train2 incorrectly marks inner bays as 7s instead of leaving as 1/0); c +=2 skip is good but condition (num_left==3 and num_right==3) triggers falsely without full config check (e.g., doesn't verify open side).
 * handle_double_vertical_bays is broken: r +=1 skip is inside col loop but affects outer r loop incorrectly (off-by-one overlaps); checks for open right/left are too rigid (e.g., Train1 doesn't trigger properly, leaving bottom bays unmarked); center_val logic sets to 0 only on absolute edge but ignores if it's a "fill" case.
 * handle_edge_straights partially works for horizontals (marks sides on top/bottom) but verticals fail boundary logic (e.g., left_one/right_one always False on edges, but condition requires not left_one etc., causing no marks); up_one/down_one mishandle r==0/rows-1 as False correctly but not applied symmetrically.
 * handle_L_bays misses non-edge cases and over-marks diagonals (e.g., Train3 row5 col9-11: generates extra 7s in what should be straight 1s); sorted(one_dirs) and opposites check is good but doesn't handle chained Ls.
 * handle_single_bays is most buggy: skip logic for open cell (if 3 neighbors or straight extension) is incomplete (e.g., Train1 row10 col6: marks 0s as 7 where expected has 0s, failing vertical open check); diagonal marking is direction-specific but errors in indices (e.g., open_i==1 marks upper diagonals correctly but overfills horizontals); additional fill for open 0 extends wrongly (e.g., fills 3-wide but ignores if open leads to edge).
 * Overall: Sequence (doubles before singles) causes over-marking in nested bays; no iteration/refinement loop, so one-pass misses propagations; Train1 diffs: row10 col5-7 all 7s (gen) vs 7,0,7/7,0,0,7 (exp, under-marked centers); row13 all 1s (gen) vs mixed 7s (exp, missed bay); Train2 diffs: row2 all 1s (gen) vs mixed (exp, missed upper structure); row3 col1-2 7,0 (gen) vs 1,0 (exp, over-marked); row6 col13-15 0,7,0 (gen) vs 0,7,7 (exp, under); Train3 diffs: row4 col4-7 1,7,7,7 (gen) vs all 1s (exp, over-marked premature bay); row12 col6-8 7,7,7 (gen) vs 7,0,7 (exp, filled center wrongly).
 * No object extraction function attempted, but patterns suggest needing one for connected 1-components (e.g., to validate bay openness globally); current funcs are local and miss global shape constraints.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: handle_double_vertical_bays (symmetric but loop-buggy, over-constrains configs like requiring r-1 and r+2 always 1); additional fill in single_bays (extends to 0s but sets result[...]=7 even if original 0, but puzzle preserves 0s—wait, code checks if result==1 before set, but for open 0 it sets without check, wrongly filling empties).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-marks many interior 1s as 7s (e.g., rows 3-5 cols10-12 all 7s, suggesting false double bay trigger) and under-marks edges (e.g., row2 col4=7 but adjacent 0s not handled as single bay properly, leaving potential L unmarked); compared to visual intuition, the left structure looks like a bay/opening needing selective 7s on boundaries only, but output fills too much (e.g., row6 col3=7 where it might be straight 1); right side row2 cols10-12=7,7,7 seems like enclosure but test has irregular 0s that should skip per rules; overall, it resembles over-aggressive bay detection without proper skip for chains/extensions, making the output too "filled" vs. expected sparse markings—likely fails if test expects similar to Train1's mixed 0/7 in bays.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (0s for empty/white, 1s for blue/filled cells) to remove isolated blue cells (single 1s with no adjacent 1s) by setting them to 0, and then highlighting certain blue cells adjacent to "small holes" (0s surrounded by at least 3 blue neighbors) by setting them to 7, likely to emphasize boundaries or internal structures in a visual puzzle like a cave or blob detection.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Isolated blues (1s) are strictly those with exactly 0 adjacent 1s (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and they must be removed to 0 before any highlighting, as they don't contribute to connected structures.
 * Small holes are 0 cells with >=3 adjacent 1s; highlighting applies to nearby 1s (horizontal left/right, and vertical in adjacent rows for a 3-wide strip), but subtle rules include: only highlight actual 1s (not low-neighbor 0s, which seems like a bug), ensure highlighting doesn't propagate to non-hole-related 1s, and handle cases where holes are part of larger patterns without over-highlighting.
 * Subtleties: Removal of isolated 1s must not affect hole detection (e.g., an isolated 1 near a hole shouldn't create false holes); vertical highlighting should be symmetric but limited to direct adjacencies; in some cases, expected outputs show no highlighting on certain 1s even if near holes, suggesting holes must be "enclosed" or minimal size (e.g., 1x1 only, not larger voids); grids have empty borders (many 0s), so edge cases matter; 7s overwrite 1s but not 0s; order matters—removal first, then highlight on the modified grid.
 * Key misses: Over-highlighting empty 0s with <=1 neighbor in vertical directions (unwanted, as 7s appear in empty areas in generated outputs); failure to highlight specific 1s in horizontal/vertical strips around holes (e.g., missing inner 1s); isolated 1s not always removed correctly if they have subtle connections post-removal; larger structures like vertical bars or blobs require precise neighbor counting without diagonal consideration; expected outputs sometimes keep isolated-like 1s if they are part of keys or labels, but here all seem structural.
 * Considerations across attempts: No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components) was used, which might help identify true isolations vs. parts of shapes; highlighting logic assumes simple 4-dir neighbors but misses cases where holes are diagonal or multi-cell; test inputs have asymmetric patterns (e.g., L-shapes or irregular blobs), so rules must handle non-rectangular holes without filling them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def num_1_neighbors(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-directional only, no diagonals
    for dr, dc in dirs:
        nr = r + dr
        nc = c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
(This is useful for both isolation checks and hole detection; it's correct and reusable.)

```python
def is_isolated_blue(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    if g[r][c] != 1:
        return False
    return num_1_neighbors(r, c, g, rows, cols) == 0
```
(This correctly identifies single isolated 1s but may miss if "isolation" includes small groups; helpful as a base for removal.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly implements basic 4-dir neighbor counting and isolated 1 removal in fill_isolated_blues, which works for clear singles but fails to remove some 1s that appear isolated in expected outputs (e.g., Train 1 row 14 col 8 remains 1 in generated but should be 0, possibly because it's not truly isolated in input or removal order issue).
 * Highlighting in highlight_small_holes detects small holes via >=3 neighbors (good for is_small_hole_center), but apply_horizontal_highlight only hits left/right 1s (partial match, works in some spots like Train 1 rows 4-5), while apply_vertical_highlight over-highlights by setting 7 on 0s with <=1 neighbor (unwanted, causes extra 7s in empty areas like Train 2 row 8 col 13-15 mismatch).
 * Train 1: Generated matches most of expected but differs in row 12 col 7 (1 instead of 7, missing vertical highlight on hole center); row 14 col 8 (1 instead of 0, failed isolation removal for unknown reason—possibly input has it connected subtly); row 16-17 match highlighting but overall incorrect due to these.
 * Train 2: Generated misses top-right highlights (row 0 ends 1,0 vs expected 7,0; row 1 ends 1,1 vs 7,7—likely undected small hole or isolation error); row 8 has partial highlights (e.g., col 7-9: 1,1,1 vs expected 7,7,7, missing vertical strip); row 5 col 13-15: 7,7,7 matches, showing some hole detection works.
 * Train 3: Generated incorrectly keeps a stray 1 in row 3 col 6 (should be 0, perhaps false isolation or no removal); highlighting in rows 5-8 and 11-12 partial (e.g., row 7 col 11: 0 vs expected 0, but misses some 7s in verticals); row 13 matches, but overall misses enclosing the central blob properly.
 * No object extraction function was used (e.g., connected components to group 1s), which could help distinguish true isolations from blob edges; current approach treats grid pixel-by-pixel, missing global structure.
 * apply_vertical_highlight is broken/not helpful (highlights low-neighbor 0s to 7, which pollutes empty space and doesn't match any expected 7 on 0s); apply_horizontal_highlight is partially helpful but too narrow for some holes.
 * program structure (remove then highlight) is logical and works for order, but temp grid copy is good practice.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows excessive and asymmetric highlighting (e.g., rows 3-11 have scattered 7s around what seems like a large irregular blob with internal 0s, but many 1s remain unhighlighted where expected might need full enclosure marking, similar to Train 1 misses; top rows 0-2 have no 7s despite potential small holes near col 10-12). 
 * It includes 7s in positions like row 4 col 4-6 and row 12 col 6-7, which might over-highlight non-hole 0s (echoing the vertical function bug), and fails to remove potential isolated 1s in borders (e.g., row 12 col 8-9 are 0,0 but structure suggests possible isolation errors). 
 * Compared to trainings, it mismatches by not fully highlighting vertical strips (e.g., row 9 col 11: 0 vs likely needing 7 if hole), and the bottom-heavy 7s in row 11 don't align with expected minimal hole emphasis; without input, hard to verify, but pattern suggests incomplete hole detection for multi-row voids, making it incorrect like the trainings.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:30:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a binary grid (0s and 1s representing empty space and filled areas, like a pixel art or blob detection task) to identify and "fill" or mark small enclosed voids (clusters of 0s surrounded by 1s) with 7s in surrounding or specific regions, while cleaning up isolated 1s and handling edge cases like near-grid boundaries. The goal appears to be simulating a "painting" or "highlighting" effect on potential "holes" or small gaps in larger 1-blobs, with rules for component size, enclosure, and special bottom-edge behavior to produce a stylized output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 16x16 based on examples, with 1s forming solid blobs or shapes and 0s as backgrounds or internal voids; the task modifies the grid by removing sparse 1s and marking small 0-clusters (size 1-3) that are sufficiently enclosed (starting with >=3 adjacent 1s).
 * Cleaning step: Remove 1s with fewer than 2 orthogonal (4-dir) neighboring 1s to eliminate noise or thin protrusions, but this must not over-clean stable structures.
 * Component detection: Use BFS-like expansion from 0-cells with >=3 neighboring 1s, but limit to small sizes (<=3 cells); only accept if fully enclosed or meeting criteria—do not expand into areas with <1 neighboring 1s.
 * Special "bottom-edge" rule for single-cell 0s: If in rows near the bottom (e.g., >= rows-4) and the cell below is 0 or out-of-bounds, treat as "special" (e.g., a dangling or edge hole), which affects marking: avoid marking upward (dr==-1) and include the cell itself in to_set.
 * Marking with 7s: For each valid component, mark a 3x3 neighborhood around each cell in the component (excluding center and upward for special cases), but clip to grid bounds; after marking, reset non-special component cells back to 0 (leaving them as voids) while keeping 7s in surroundings.
 * Subtleties: Components must be connected orthogonally (4-dir); expansion stops if size >3 or no more valid expansions; special rule only for size=1 and specific bottom positions—overapplying it creates extra 7s; do not mark original 1s as 7 unless they fall into the neighborhood; preserve large 0-areas or non-enclosed 0s without changes.
 * Edge cases: Near grid edges (top/bottom), components may start with fewer neighbors but still qualify if >=3 total; bottom special rule seems to handle "open" holes at the base of shapes; avoid marking outside blobs (e.g., large empty 0-regions should stay 0).
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes detecting "internal" small holes in 1-blobs and shading their immediate borders with 7s, but leaving the hole itself 0 unless special; this creates a visual "depth" or "shadow" effect.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import collections

def count_one(r: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
    """Counts orthogonal (4-dir) neighboring 1s for a cell; useful for enclosure checks and cleaning."""
    dirs4 = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    cnt = 0
    for dr, dc in dirs4:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and g[nr][nc] == 1:
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

```python
def find_small_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[List[tuple[int, int]], bool]]:
    """Extracts small (size <=3) 0-components starting from cells with >=3 neighbor 1s, using BFS expansion limited to cells with >=1 neighbor 1s; returns list of (component cells, is_special) where is_special is for bottom-edge single 0s."""
    # Implementation as in the provided code's component finding logic, with visited matrix and deque for BFS.
    # Note: Expansion uses a level-by-level approach to control size, breaking if >3.
    pass  # Full impl from code is helpful for core detection
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core cleaning, small component detection (size <=3), and basic 7-marking around enclosed 0s works for simple cases without special bottom rules.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated has extra 1s in row 0 (all 1s instead of 7 at col14 and 0 at col15), row 1 (extra 1 at col15 instead of 7), row 2 (all 1s, but expected also all 1s—wait, minor; actual diffs in row 8 col13=0 but expected=1, and scattered 7/0 mismatches in rows 6-9 cols 13-15, e.g., generated row6 col15=7 but expected=7, but row7 col14=0 expected but generated=7?); overall, over-marked some neighborhoods and failed to preserve a 1 in a cleaned area, suggesting special rule or reset logic bugs for non-bottom components.
 * Training example 3 incorrect: Generated has row12 all 1s in cols 2-4 but expected 7,0,7; specifically, row12 col2=1 gen vs 7 exp, col3=1 vs 0, col4=1 vs 7—this indicates failure to detect or mark a small bottom component properly, likely missing the special single-0 rule or incorrect expansion/reset (also row11 cols2-4 all 1s gen but exp has 7s in row12, suggesting upward marking leak).
 * The cleaning step (remove 1s with <2 neighbors) worked in all but may be too aggressive in dense areas.
 * Component finding with BFS and size limit is helpful and partially correct (catches some holes), but expansion condition (>=1 neighbor 1s) allows overgrowth in some cases, and special bottom check (row >=rows-4 and below=0) is applied but buggy—e.g., in train3, it marked row13 correctly but missed adjusting row12/11.
 * to_set collection with 3x3 offsets (excluding center, and dr!=-1 for special) is core but overincludes for non-special (resets component to 0 correctly, but marks too broadly); in train2, this caused extra 7s in top-right without preserving expected 1s.
 * Visited matrix prevents re-processing but may mark invalid starts if not checking g[r][c]==0 strictly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the level-by-level BFS with "expanded" flag is clunky and error-prone for size control—simpler recursive DFS might help but current is mostly useful.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-marks with 7s in irregular patterns (e.g., row4 cols4-6=7,7,7 but input seems to have a dense 1-blob there—assuming test input is a large shape with internal holes, this scatters 7s inside what should be solid 1s); row2 cols10-12=7,7,7 suggests detecting a small top-hole but expected might leave it as 0s or minimal marking without disrupting left 1s.
 * Missing preservation of large 1-structures: Rows 0-2 and 13-15 are mostly 1s/0s but gen has 7s bleeding into col10+ in row2/10/11, which looks like over-expansion of a right-side component—expected likely keeps left blob solid 1s and only shades small internal voids on the right.
 * Bottom handling seems partially applied (row11 cols5-7=7,7,7 and row12 cols5-7=7,7,7,0?), but row12 ends with many 0s while gen has 7s early—suggests special rule triggered incorrectly, creating a "shadow" that doesn't match a clean hole fill; overall, output has too many isolated 7s (e.g., row3 col13=7, row6 col3=7) which break blob continuity, indicating neighborhood marking is too aggressive without enclosure validation.
 * To handle test: Need stricter component validation (e.g., ensure full enclosure post-expansion) and limit special rule to true dangling bottoms; test likely has multiple small holes in a vertical shape, so marking should create symmetric 7-borders without filling entire rows.
