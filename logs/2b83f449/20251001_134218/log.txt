=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 13:42:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 13:53:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:04:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

[2025-10-01 14:04:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    while i < len(row) - 2:

            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1

    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6

    Still helpful as a base for gap-filling logic, but needs refinement for full scans.
    """
    # (code as provided in attempt)
    pass  # Omitted for brevity; see original
```

```python
# Note: add_border_3s and add_extension are helpful but complex; add_border_3s has segment detection which is key for border connections, but its right-end scan logic has off-by-one risks (s +=1 after while). add_extension is simple and useful for non-gappy rows.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:09:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    For odd rows: Replaces every '7,7,7' sequence with '8,6,8' and skips ahead.
    Helpful for handling temporary patterns in odd rows without overlaps.

    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1

        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6

        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row

    """
    # (Full function body as in the program; it's helpful but complex—note the distance logic: left uses min_k <=5 for bottom, right uses dist <=4)
    # ...
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 14:09:43] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform into each other in a repeatable way. No high-level puzzle solution or interpretation is implied. Connections that are not present in every example (e.g., specific Maroon rearrangements, which vary in detail between examples) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., exact Maroon block formation, Green extensions) are noted as such rather than forced.

1. **Dark Red (input) position and orientation → Pink (output) position, orientation, and color**  
   - **Description**: Each Dark Red component in the input (always a horizontal 3-pixel segment on odd-numbered y-rows, with holes=0) consistently transforms into a corresponding Pink component in the output (a vertical 3-pixel segment, with holes=0, pixels=3).  
   - **Interconnected properties**:  
     - Input y-position (center of the odd row) → Output y-range: The Pink spans rows (input_y - 1) to (input_y + 1), effectively bridging the adjacent even rows.  
     - Input x-center (midpoint of the bbox x1 to x2, e.g., for bbox=[3,1,5,1], center=(3+5)/2=4) → Output x-position: The Pink is placed as a single-column vertical at x = input x-center.  
     - Input orientation (horizontal, height=1) → Output orientation (vertical, width=1).  
     - Input color (Dark Red) → Output color (Pink).  
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every Dark Red instance across both train inputs, with exact positional mapping (e.g., Train 1: input [3,1,5,1] → output [4,0,4,2]; Train 2: input [3,1,5,1] → output [4,0,4,2]). No exceptions or variations.  
   - **Notes**: Pixel count remains 3 (area preserved). This is the only transformation with direct, one-to-one correspondence.

2. **Green (input/output) edge positions → Boundary preservation with minor extension**  
   - **Description**: Green components (single-pixel or small segments, holes=0) in inputs act as left/right edge markers (at x=0 and x=max_width, typically on even y-rows), and similar Green components appear in outputs at comparable edge locations, suggesting a boundary-defining interaction.  
   - **Interconnected properties**:  
     - Input position (x=0 or x=max on even y) → Output position: Greens are retained or slightly extended horizontally (e.g., from 1 pixel to 2 pixels wide) at left (x=0 to 0/1) and right (x=max-1/0 to max) edges, often on even y-rows or adjacent.  
     - No color change (Green → Green).  
     - Pixels: Minor increase (1 → 1 or 2) in some cases, possibly interacting with adjacent Maroon to fill boundary gaps.  
   - **Consistency**: Present in both train examples at edges (e.g., Train 1 input x=0/18 on even rows → output Greens at x=0/17-18 or x=14/18 on even/near-even rows; Train 2 input x=0/15 → output x=0/14-15). Always at boundaries, no internal Greens.  
   - **Notes**: Extension logic is consistent but minor (always +0 or +1 pixel width); exact trigger (e.g., interaction with Maroon or Pink proximity) is unknown and not forced here.

### Excluded or Unknown Aspects
- **Maroon components**: Inputs feature horizontal bars (mostly on even rows, pixels varying by length), outputs feature vertical/blocky segments (pixels often larger, e.g., 5-42). Positions interact indirectly (e.g., Maroon in input surrounds Dark Red gaps, output Maroon fills around Pink), but no direct, consistent one-to-one transformation (e.g., specific input segments mapping to specific output blocks) is observable across both examples—variations in stacking and protrusion prevent inclusion.  
- **Holes**: All components have holes=0 in both input and output; no interaction or change.  
- **Overall grid/symmetry**: Inputs show layered horizontal repetition; outputs introduce vertical asymmetry. No consistent property-level connection (e.g., total pixels or bbox overlap) affects transformation reliably across examples.  
- **Empty space/background**: Implied separation in both, but no detectable interaction with other components (e.g., no consistent effect on movement or transformation).  
- **Test input**: Not analyzed for connections, per instructions (focus on train consistency only).  

No other obvious, consistent interactions were identifiable without forcing unrelated elements.

[2025-10-01 14:10:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6

        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row

    """
    # (Full function body as in the program; it's helpful but complex—note the distance logic: left uses min_k <=5 for bottom, right uses dist <=4)
    # ...
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform into each other in a repeatable way. No high-level puzzle solution or interpretation is implied. Connections that are not present in every example (e.g., specific Maroon rearrangements, which vary in detail between examples) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., exact Maroon block formation, Green extensions) are noted as such rather than forced.

1. **Dark Red (input) position and orientation → Pink (output) position, orientation, and color**  
   - **Description**: Each Dark Red component in the input (always a horizontal 3-pixel segment on odd-numbered y-rows, with holes=0) consistently transforms into a corresponding Pink component in the output (a vertical 3-pixel segment, with holes=0, pixels=3).  
   - **Interconnected properties**:  
     - Input y-position (center of the odd row) → Output y-range: The Pink spans rows (input_y - 1) to (input_y + 1), effectively bridging the adjacent even rows.  
     - Input x-center (midpoint of the bbox x1 to x2, e.g., for bbox=[3,1,5,1], center=(3+5)/2=4) → Output x-position: The Pink is placed as a single-column vertical at x = input x-center.  
     - Input orientation (horizontal, height=1) → Output orientation (vertical, width=1).  
     - Input color (Dark Red) → Output color (Pink).  
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every Dark Red instance across both train inputs, with exact positional mapping (e.g., Train 1: input [3,1,5,1] → output [4,0,4,2]; Train 2: input [3,1,5,1] → output [4,0,4,2]). No exceptions or variations.  
   - **Notes**: Pixel count remains 3 (area preserved). This is the only transformation with direct, one-to-one correspondence.

2. **Green (input/output) edge positions → Boundary preservation with minor extension**  
   - **Description**: Green components (single-pixel or small segments, holes=0) in inputs act as left/right edge markers (at x=0 and x=max_width, typically on even y-rows), and similar Green components appear in outputs at comparable edge locations, suggesting a boundary-defining interaction.  
   - **Interconnected properties**:  
     - Input position (x=0 or x=max on even y) → Output position: Greens are retained or slightly extended horizontally (e.g., from 1 pixel to 2 pixels wide) at left (x=0 to 0/1) and right (x=max-1/0 to max) edges, often on even y-rows or adjacent.  
     - No color change (Green → Green).  
     - Pixels: Minor increase (1 → 1 or 2) in some cases, possibly interacting with adjacent Maroon to fill boundary gaps.  
   - **Consistency**: Present in both train examples at edges (e.g., Train 1 input x=0/18 on even rows → output Greens at x=0/17-18 or x=14/18 on even/near-even rows; Train 2 input x=0/15 → output x=0/14-15). Always at boundaries, no internal Greens.  
   - **Notes**: Extension logic is consistent but minor (always +0 or +1 pixel width); exact trigger (e.g., interaction with Maroon or Pink proximity) is unknown and not forced here.

### Excluded or Unknown Aspects
- **Maroon components**: Inputs feature horizontal bars (mostly on even rows, pixels varying by length), outputs feature vertical/blocky segments (pixels often larger, e.g., 5-42). Positions interact indirectly (e.g., Maroon in input surrounds Dark Red gaps, output Maroon fills around Pink), but no direct, consistent one-to-one transformation (e.g., specific input segments mapping to specific output blocks) is observable across both examples—variations in stacking and protrusion prevent inclusion.  
- **Holes**: All components have holes=0 in both input and output; no interaction or change.  
- **Overall grid/symmetry**: Inputs show layered horizontal repetition; outputs introduce vertical asymmetry. No consistent property-level connection (e.g., total pixels or bbox overlap) affects transformation reliably across examples.  
- **Empty space/background**: Implied separation in both, but no detectable interaction with other components (e.g., no consistent effect on movement or transformation).  
- **Test input**: Not analyzed for connections, per instructions (focus on train consistency only).  

No other obvious, consistent interactions were identifiable without forcing unrelated elements.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:16:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

[2025-10-01 14:16:40] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to elements that demonstrably affect or transform each other in a repeatable way. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant static elements (e.g., isolated Green boundary markers without transformation) are included. Connections are described factually without speculation on unexplainable aspects. All components consistently have `holes=0`, so no interactions involve holes. No inconsistent or one-off elements (e.g., unique Maroon splits in only one example) are listed.

1. **Color Transformation: Dark Red (input) → Pink (output)**  
   - Every Dark Red component in the input directly corresponds to a Pink component in the output (one-to-one mapping, with matching counts: 12 in Train 1, 6 in Train 2).  
   - This color change is consistent and affects the visual distinction of the transforming elements, with no other colors undergoing similar shifts.  
   - Interaction: The color shift is tied to shape and position changes (see below), altering how these components integrate with surrounding Maroon areas.

2. **Shape/Orientation Transformation: Horizontal (input) → Vertical (output)**  
   - All Dark Red components in inputs are horizontal rectangles (`bbox` with width=3, height=1, `pixels=3`).  
   - All corresponding Pink components in outputs are vertical rectangles (`bbox` with width=1, height=3, `pixels=3`).  
   - This is a consistent 90-degree rotation effect, preserving the `pixels=3` count.  
   - Interaction: The orientation change causes these components to interact differently with adjacent Maroon fills (e.g., spanning multiple rows instead of columns), leading to bbox adjustments in Maroon (see Maroon connection below). No other shapes (e.g., Green or Maroon) show this transformation.

3. **Position Preservation: Center Coordinate (cx, cy) Unchanged**  
   - The center position of each Dark Red (`cx = (x1 + x2)/2`, `cy = y1` since height=1) exactly matches the center of the corresponding Pink (`cx = x1` since width=1, `cy = (y1 + y2)/2`).  
   - Examples (consistent in both trains):  
     - Input Dark Red at `bbox=[3,1,5,1]` (cx=4, cy=1) → Output Pink at `bbox=[4,0,4,2]` (cx=4, cy=1).  
     - Input Dark Red at `bbox=[11,3,13,3]` (Train 2; cx=12, cy=3) → Output Pink at `bbox=[12,2,12,4]` (cx=12, cy=3).  
   - Interaction: Position stability links the transformation to the grid structure, ensuring transformed components remain aligned with existing Maroon boundaries or interruptions. Slight bbox edge shifts (e.g., y-start adjusts by -1 or +1) occur but preserve the center, affecting how they border Green edges.

4. **Maroon Fills Interaction with Dark Red/Pink Positions**  
   - Maroon components (large `pixels` counts, variable bbox) in inputs surround or are adjacent to Dark Red positions (e.g., horizontal Maroon strips at even y-levels near odd-y Dark Red).  
   - In outputs, Maroon bboxes are reconfigured (merged, split, or extended) to accommodate the vertical Pink orientations, consistently filling gaps or enclosing the new positions without overlap.  
   - Pixel totals for Maroon increase in outputs (e.g., Train 1: input ~130 Maroon pixels → output ~150+; Train 2: input ~78 → output ~84), suggesting addition or redistribution tied to Pink placements.  
   - Interaction: Dark Red/Pink positions directly effect Maroon bbox transformations (e.g., vertical Pink at a fixed cx causes Maroon to extend vertically around it). Specific redistribution rules (e.g., how pixels are added) are unknown and consistent but unexplainable from data.

5. **Pixel Count Consistency in Transformations**  
   - Transformed components (Dark Red → Pink) retain exactly `pixels=3`, linking size preservation to the rotation.  
   - Interaction: This fixed size ensures consistent "mass" or area effect on Maroon enclosures, preventing arbitrary scaling that could disrupt grid interactions.

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **Green Components**: Appear consistently as small (`pixels=1` or `2`) edge markers (e.g., at x=0 or right boundary), with minor bbox extensions in outputs (e.g., `pixels=2` spanning 2 units). They do not transform or directly affect other elements (no position/color/shape links to Dark Red/Pink or Maroon changes), so no interactions are identified.  
- **Unknowns**: No consistent interactions involve black solids, silhouettes, or edge properties beyond position preservation. Maroon reconfiguration mechanism (e.g., exact fill rules) is consistent but cannot be explained from the data—marked as unknown. No forced connections (e.g., semantic meanings like "walls" or "obstacles") as they are not evident in bboxes/pixels.  
- These connections are derived solely from pairwise input-output comparisons in the two train examples and apply only to elements with demonstrated effects across both. The test input is not analyzed for connections, per instructions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 14:19:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to elements that demonstrably affect or transform each other in a repeatable way. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant static elements (e.g., isolated Green boundary markers without transformation) are included. Connections are described factually without speculation on unexplainable aspects. All components consistently have `holes=0`, so no interactions involve holes. No inconsistent or one-off elements (e.g., unique Maroon splits in only one example) are listed.

1. **Color Transformation: Dark Red (input) → Pink (output)**  
   - Every Dark Red component in the input directly corresponds to a Pink component in the output (one-to-one mapping, with matching counts: 12 in Train 1, 6 in Train 2).  
   - This color change is consistent and affects the visual distinction of the transforming elements, with no other colors undergoing similar shifts.  
   - Interaction: The color shift is tied to shape and position changes (see below), altering how these components integrate with surrounding Maroon areas.

2. **Shape/Orientation Transformation: Horizontal (input) → Vertical (output)**  
   - All Dark Red components in inputs are horizontal rectangles (`bbox` with width=3, height=1, `pixels=3`).  
   - All corresponding Pink components in outputs are vertical rectangles (`bbox` with width=1, height=3, `pixels=3`).  
   - This is a consistent 90-degree rotation effect, preserving the `pixels=3` count.  
   - Interaction: The orientation change causes these components to interact differently with adjacent Maroon fills (e.g., spanning multiple rows instead of columns), leading to bbox adjustments in Maroon (see Maroon connection below). No other shapes (e.g., Green or Maroon) show this transformation.

3. **Position Preservation: Center Coordinate (cx, cy) Unchanged**  
   - The center position of each Dark Red (`cx = (x1 + x2)/2`, `cy = y1` since height=1) exactly matches the center of the corresponding Pink (`cx = x1` since width=1, `cy = (y1 + y2)/2`).  
   - Examples (consistent in both trains):  
     - Input Dark Red at `bbox=[3,1,5,1]` (cx=4, cy=1) → Output Pink at `bbox=[4,0,4,2]` (cx=4, cy=1).  
     - Input Dark Red at `bbox=[11,3,13,3]` (Train 2; cx=12, cy=3) → Output Pink at `bbox=[12,2,12,4]` (cx=12, cy=3).  
   - Interaction: Position stability links the transformation to the grid structure, ensuring transformed components remain aligned with existing Maroon boundaries or interruptions. Slight bbox edge shifts (e.g., y-start adjusts by -1 or +1) occur but preserve the center, affecting how they border Green edges.

4. **Maroon Fills Interaction with Dark Red/Pink Positions**  
   - Maroon components (large `pixels` counts, variable bbox) in inputs surround or are adjacent to Dark Red positions (e.g., horizontal Maroon strips at even y-levels near odd-y Dark Red).  
   - In outputs, Maroon bboxes are reconfigured (merged, split, or extended) to accommodate the vertical Pink orientations, consistently filling gaps or enclosing the new positions without overlap.  
   - Pixel totals for Maroon increase in outputs (e.g., Train 1: input ~130 Maroon pixels → output ~150+; Train 2: input ~78 → output ~84), suggesting addition or redistribution tied to Pink placements.  
   - Interaction: Dark Red/Pink positions directly effect Maroon bbox transformations (e.g., vertical Pink at a fixed cx causes Maroon to extend vertically around it). Specific redistribution rules (e.g., how pixels are added) are unknown and consistent but unexplainable from data.

5. **Pixel Count Consistency in Transformations**  
   - Transformed components (Dark Red → Pink) retain exactly `pixels=3`, linking size preservation to the rotation.  
   - Interaction: This fixed size ensures consistent "mass" or area effect on Maroon enclosures, preventing arbitrary scaling that could disrupt grid interactions.

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **Green Components**: Appear consistently as small (`pixels=1` or `2`) edge markers (e.g., at x=0 or right boundary), with minor bbox extensions in outputs (e.g., `pixels=2` spanning 2 units). They do not transform or directly affect other elements (no position/color/shape links to Dark Red/Pink or Maroon changes), so no interactions are identified.  
- **Unknowns**: No consistent interactions involve black solids, silhouettes, or edge properties beyond position preservation. Maroon reconfiguration mechanism (e.g., exact fill rules) is consistent but cannot be explained from the data—marked as unknown. No forced connections (e.g., semantic meanings like "walls" or "obstacles") as they are not evident in bboxes/pixels.  
- These connections are derived solely from pairwise input-output comparisons in the two train examples and apply only to elements with demonstrated effects across both. The test input is not analyzed for connections, per instructions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:22:36] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces 7,7,7 with 8,6,8 in odd rows; simple but effective for pattern compression.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

[2025-10-01 14:22:44] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case, without forcing unrelated or inconsistent links. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated Maroon fills without transformation ties, or single-pixel elements without repeated impact) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation explanation is attempted; unknown aspects (e.g., exact border adjustments) are noted as such. All identified connections involve position, color, or shape properties influencing placement or form in the output.

1. **Input Dark Red block x-center position → Output Pink block x-position**  
   - Consistent: In both train inputs, each 3-pixel horizontal Dark Red block's center x-coordinate (e.g., midpoint of bbox like [3,1,5,1] centers at x=4) directly determines the x-position of a corresponding 3-pixel vertical Pink block in the output (placed at that exact x).  
   - Interaction: This positional mapping preserves the horizontal alignment, affecting the output layout by anchoring Pinks to input Dark Red locations. No variation across examples.  
   - Example: Train 1 row y=1 Dark Reds at centers x=4 and x=10 → Output Pinks at x=4 and x=10. Train 2 row y=1 Dark Red at x=4 → Output Pink at x=4.

2. **Input Dark Red block sequential y-order → Output Pink block sequential y-slot placement**  
   - Consistent: Dark Red blocks appear in increasing y-order on odd rows in inputs (e.g., first at y=1, second at y=3, etc.). In outputs, corresponding Pinks are placed in sequential 2-unit high y-slots starting from y=0 (e.g., first in y=0-2, second in y=2-4, etc.), regardless of input y-spacing.  
   - Interaction: The row-based order in input drives the vertical stacking order in output, transforming scattered horizontal placements into ordered vertical ones. This affects overall composition depth and layering. No exceptions in either train example.  
   - Example: Train 1 has 11 Dark Reds across 6 odd rows → 11 Pinks in 6 sequential y-slots (y=0-2 up to y=10-12). Train 2 has 6 Dark Reds across 5 odd rows → 6 Pinks in 5 y-slots (y=0-2 up to y=8-10).

3. **Input Dark Red block shape/size (3-pixel horizontal) → Output Pink block shape/size (3-pixel vertical)**  
   - Consistent: Every input Dark Red is a flat 3-pixel horizontal rectangle (bbox width=3, height=1, pixels=3, holes=0). Every output Pink is a rotated 3-pixel vertical rectangle (bbox width=1, height=3, pixels=3, holes=0).  
   - Interaction: The fixed size and horizontal orientation in input directly transform to vertical orientation in output, affecting movement-like reorientation within the grid. Pixel count remains invariant. Applies to all such blocks in both examples (no other sizes interact this way).  
   - Note: No holes in either, so no hole-related interaction observed.

4. **Input Dark Red color → Output Pink color**  
   - Consistent: All transforming blocks shift from Dark Red in input to Pink in output. No other colors (e.g., Green or Maroon) undergo this specific change.  
   - Interaction: Color property triggers the visible transformation, influencing how the block integrates with surrounding elements (e.g., contrasting against Maroon backgrounds). Exclusive to these blocks in both trains.

5. **Dark Red/Pink blocks position → Adjacent Maroon background expansion/adjustment**  
   - Consistent: Input Maroon forms solid horizontal fills on even rows (bbox spanning most width, variable pixels). In outputs, Maroon bbox expand vertically and split horizontally around Pink positions, creating layered zones (e.g., taller rectangles abutting Pinks).  
   - Interaction: Positions of transforming blocks (Dark Red in → Pink out) cause Maroon to adapt by filling gaps, affecting overall depth and borders (e.g., Maroon pixels increase to accommodate vertical Pinks). This reshaping is consistent but secondary to the block positions. No standalone Maroon changes without block influence.  
   - Example: In both trains, Maroon near input Dark Reds (e.g., above/below on even y) expands in output to wrap vertical Pinks (e.g., bbox heights increase from 1 to 6+ units).

6. **Grid horizontal black bars (implied) → Y-slot boundaries for Pink placement**  
   - Consistent: Inputs and outputs both feature thick black horizontal lines dividing rows (mentioned in framing, not in pixel lists). These align with even y in inputs and define the 2-unit y-slots in outputs.  
   - Interaction: Bar positions constrain the vertical transformation of Dark Red to Pink, enforcing slot-based movement (e.g., Pinks span exactly between bars). Affects consistency of y-ordering in both examples. Vertical black bars (staggered in outputs) do not show clear consistent interaction beyond general grid support.

### Unknown or Inconsistent Aspects
- **Green elements transformation**: Input Greens are single-pixel vertical borders at sides (x=0 and x=max, on even y, pixels=1). Outputs add thicker/horizontal Greens (e.g., pixels=2, spanning x=0-1 or similar at slot boundaries). Possible interaction with Pink count per slot (e.g., thickening when multiple Pinks present), but not consistent or explainable across both trains—marked as unknown.
- **Vertical black bars**: More uniform in inputs, staggered in outputs; no clear tie to specific block positions or colors in every case.
- No consistent hole interactions (all holes=0 everywhere). No evidence of silhouette or edge properties (beyond bbox) affecting changes. Irrelevant elements like isolated end-row Maroons show no repeated connections.

[2025-10-01 14:23:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case, without forcing unrelated or inconsistent links. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated Maroon fills without transformation ties, or single-pixel elements without repeated impact) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation explanation is attempted; unknown aspects (e.g., exact border adjustments) are noted as such. All identified connections involve position, color, or shape properties influencing placement or form in the output.

1. **Input Dark Red block x-center position → Output Pink block x-position**  
   - Consistent: In both train inputs, each 3-pixel horizontal Dark Red block's center x-coordinate (e.g., midpoint of bbox like [3,1,5,1] centers at x=4) directly determines the x-position of a corresponding 3-pixel vertical Pink block in the output (placed at that exact x).  
   - Interaction: This positional mapping preserves the horizontal alignment, affecting the output layout by anchoring Pinks to input Dark Red locations. No variation across examples.  
   - Example: Train 1 row y=1 Dark Reds at centers x=4 and x=10 → Output Pinks at x=4 and x=10. Train 2 row y=1 Dark Red at x=4 → Output Pink at x=4.

2. **Input Dark Red block sequential y-order → Output Pink block sequential y-slot placement**  
   - Consistent: Dark Red blocks appear in increasing y-order on odd rows in inputs (e.g., first at y=1, second at y=3, etc.). In outputs, corresponding Pinks are placed in sequential 2-unit high y-slots starting from y=0 (e.g., first in y=0-2, second in y=2-4, etc.), regardless of input y-spacing.  
   - Interaction: The row-based order in input drives the vertical stacking order in output, transforming scattered horizontal placements into ordered vertical ones. This affects overall composition depth and layering. No exceptions in either train example.  
   - Example: Train 1 has 11 Dark Reds across 6 odd rows → 11 Pinks in 6 sequential y-slots (y=0-2 up to y=10-12). Train 2 has 6 Dark Reds across 5 odd rows → 6 Pinks in 5 y-slots (y=0-2 up to y=8-10).

3. **Input Dark Red block shape/size (3-pixel horizontal) → Output Pink block shape/size (3-pixel vertical)**  
   - Consistent: Every input Dark Red is a flat 3-pixel horizontal rectangle (bbox width=3, height=1, pixels=3, holes=0). Every output Pink is a rotated 3-pixel vertical rectangle (bbox width=1, height=3, pixels=3, holes=0).  
   - Interaction: The fixed size and horizontal orientation in input directly transform to vertical orientation in output, affecting movement-like reorientation within the grid. Pixel count remains invariant. Applies to all such blocks in both examples (no other sizes interact this way).  
   - Note: No holes in either, so no hole-related interaction observed.

4. **Input Dark Red color → Output Pink color**  
   - Consistent: All transforming blocks shift from Dark Red in input to Pink in output. No other colors (e.g., Green or Maroon) undergo this specific change.  
   - Interaction: Color property triggers the visible transformation, influencing how the block integrates with surrounding elements (e.g., contrasting against Maroon backgrounds). Exclusive to these blocks in both trains.

5. **Dark Red/Pink blocks position → Adjacent Maroon background expansion/adjustment**  
   - Consistent: Input Maroon forms solid horizontal fills on even rows (bbox spanning most width, variable pixels). In outputs, Maroon bbox expand vertically and split horizontally around Pink positions, creating layered zones (e.g., taller rectangles abutting Pinks).  
   - Interaction: Positions of transforming blocks (Dark Red in → Pink out) cause Maroon to adapt by filling gaps, affecting overall depth and borders (e.g., Maroon pixels increase to accommodate vertical Pinks). This reshaping is consistent but secondary to the block positions. No standalone Maroon changes without block influence.  
   - Example: In both trains, Maroon near input Dark Reds (e.g., above/below on even y) expands in output to wrap vertical Pinks (e.g., bbox heights increase from 1 to 6+ units).

6. **Grid horizontal black bars (implied) → Y-slot boundaries for Pink placement**  
   - Consistent: Inputs and outputs both feature thick black horizontal lines dividing rows (mentioned in framing, not in pixel lists). These align with even y in inputs and define the 2-unit y-slots in outputs.  
   - Interaction: Bar positions constrain the vertical transformation of Dark Red to Pink, enforcing slot-based movement (e.g., Pinks span exactly between bars). Affects consistency of y-ordering in both examples. Vertical black bars (staggered in outputs) do not show clear consistent interaction beyond general grid support.

### Unknown or Inconsistent Aspects
- **Green elements transformation**: Input Greens are single-pixel vertical borders at sides (x=0 and x=max, on even y, pixels=1). Outputs add thicker/horizontal Greens (e.g., pixels=2, spanning x=0-1 or similar at slot boundaries). Possible interaction with Pink count per slot (e.g., thickening when multiple Pinks present), but not consistent or explainable across both trains—marked as unknown.
- **Vertical black bars**: More uniform in inputs, staggered in outputs; no clear tie to specific block positions or colors in every case.
- No consistent hole interactions (all holes=0 everywhere). No evidence of silhouette or edge properties (beyond bbox) affecting changes. Irrelevant elements like isolated end-row Maroons show no repeated connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:25:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 14:26:18] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (ensuring consistency across both examples; the test input was not used for pattern identification as per instructions), here is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between components/properties. Only those present in **every** example are included. No high-level solving or total puzzle understanding is implied or attempted. Unknown or inconsistent transformations (e.g., exact rules for horizontal Green extensions or full Maroon reshaping logic) are noted as such rather than explained. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., pixel counts beyond basic sizing, holes=0 which is uniform and non-interactive) are excluded. Connections are limited to direct, observable links like position-to-position, component-to-component, or property-to-property effects.

1. **Dark Red horizontal bars (input) → Pink vertical bars (output) via position transformation**:
   - Each Dark Red component (horizontal, always 3 pixels, bbox width=3, height=1) in the input is consistently transformed into a Pink component (vertical, always 3 pixels, bbox height=3, width=1) in the output.
   - The center x-position of the input Dark Red (calculated as (x1 + x2)/2, always integer) directly determines the x-position of the corresponding output Pink (bbox x1 = x2 = center).
   - The y-position of the input Dark Red determines the starting y-block for the output Pink: input bar rows (always odd y-values like 1,3,5,7,9,11) map sequentially to output y-blocks of height 3 starting from y=0 (e.g., input y=1 → output y=0-2; input y=3 → y=2-4; etc.).
   - Multiple Dark Red bars at the same input y-row always produce an equal number of Pink bars in the same output y-block, preserving relative x-order.

2. **Dark Red/Pink bar positions → Maroon region divisions and bounding boxes**:
   - Positions of input Dark Red bars (x and y) consistently affect the x-spans and divisions of output Maroon components, creating vertically oriented Maroon regions (bbox often taller than wide) that are bounded on left/right by Green borders or Pink x-positions.
   - Gaps or spans between input Dark Red x-positions (in the same y-row) correspond to the widths of output Maroon bboxes in the mapped y-block (e.g., space left of first Pink → leftmost Maroon x-span; between Pinks → intermediate Maroon spans).
   - Input Maroon horizontal spans (between Green borders) influence the overall height of output Maroon components, which often extend across multiple y-blocks (e.g., full-height Maroons spanning from y=0 to near bottom), but are split vertically where Pink bars are present.
   - Unknown: Exact pixel counts and fill density within output Maroon bboxes (variable, not always full rectangle); this interaction is positional only, not area-preserving.

3. **Green border positions → Framing of Maroon and Pink components**:
   - Input Green vertical border components (single-pixel width at x=0 and x=max_width, spanning multiple y) consistently frame the entire composition in the output, with their y-spans adjusted to cover the full height (from y=0 to bottom row).
   - The left (x=0) and right (x=max) Green borders interact with Maroon and Pink positions by defining the outer bounds of all output Maroon bboxes (e.g., many output Maroons start at x=0 or end at x=max-1).
   - Input Green borders' y-positions (full vertical lines) ensure output Pinks and Maroons do not extend beyond x=0 or x=max, maintaining composition framing.
   - Unknown: Rules for occasional horizontal extensions of Green borders in output (e.g., bbox width>1 at specific y like bottoms of some Pink blocks); this occurs in both examples but not at every Pink block end, so inconsistent for full explanation.

4. **Input bottom-row Maroon splits → Output small internal Green placements**:
   - When the input bottom row (final y, e.g., y=10 or y=12) has split Maroon components (multiple separate bboxes with gaps, not a single full span), the output consistently places small single-pixel Green components at the starting x-position of each internal (non-leftmost) Maroon segment in that row.
   - These small Greens interact with the split Maroons by marking division points, preserving the gap positions (e.g., input gaps at certain x → Green at start of next Maroon).
   - In cases with no bottom-row splits (single full Maroon), no internal small Greens appear at bottom (only border Greens).
   - The leftmost bottom Maroon always interacts with the existing left Green border (no new small Green added).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects beyond Dark Red → Pink; no hole or silhouette-based effects, as all have holes=0; no consistent edge/hole transformations). Semantic meanings (e.g., "structural lines" vs. "accent lines") cannot be confirmed from data alone and are not forced.

[2025-10-01 14:27:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (ensuring consistency across both examples; the test input was not used for pattern identification as per instructions), here is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between components/properties. Only those present in **every** example are included. No high-level solving or total puzzle understanding is implied or attempted. Unknown or inconsistent transformations (e.g., exact rules for horizontal Green extensions or full Maroon reshaping logic) are noted as such rather than explained. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., pixel counts beyond basic sizing, holes=0 which is uniform and non-interactive) are excluded. Connections are limited to direct, observable links like position-to-position, component-to-component, or property-to-property effects.

1. **Dark Red horizontal bars (input) → Pink vertical bars (output) via position transformation**:
   - Each Dark Red component (horizontal, always 3 pixels, bbox width=3, height=1) in the input is consistently transformed into a Pink component (vertical, always 3 pixels, bbox height=3, width=1) in the output.
   - The center x-position of the input Dark Red (calculated as (x1 + x2)/2, always integer) directly determines the x-position of the corresponding output Pink (bbox x1 = x2 = center).
   - The y-position of the input Dark Red determines the starting y-block for the output Pink: input bar rows (always odd y-values like 1,3,5,7,9,11) map sequentially to output y-blocks of height 3 starting from y=0 (e.g., input y=1 → output y=0-2; input y=3 → y=2-4; etc.).
   - Multiple Dark Red bars at the same input y-row always produce an equal number of Pink bars in the same output y-block, preserving relative x-order.

2. **Dark Red/Pink bar positions → Maroon region divisions and bounding boxes**:
   - Positions of input Dark Red bars (x and y) consistently affect the x-spans and divisions of output Maroon components, creating vertically oriented Maroon regions (bbox often taller than wide) that are bounded on left/right by Green borders or Pink x-positions.
   - Gaps or spans between input Dark Red x-positions (in the same y-row) correspond to the widths of output Maroon bboxes in the mapped y-block (e.g., space left of first Pink → leftmost Maroon x-span; between Pinks → intermediate Maroon spans).
   - Input Maroon horizontal spans (between Green borders) influence the overall height of output Maroon components, which often extend across multiple y-blocks (e.g., full-height Maroons spanning from y=0 to near bottom), but are split vertically where Pink bars are present.
   - Unknown: Exact pixel counts and fill density within output Maroon bboxes (variable, not always full rectangle); this interaction is positional only, not area-preserving.

3. **Green border positions → Framing of Maroon and Pink components**:
   - Input Green vertical border components (single-pixel width at x=0 and x=max_width, spanning multiple y) consistently frame the entire composition in the output, with their y-spans adjusted to cover the full height (from y=0 to bottom row).
   - The left (x=0) and right (x=max) Green borders interact with Maroon and Pink positions by defining the outer bounds of all output Maroon bboxes (e.g., many output Maroons start at x=0 or end at x=max-1).
   - Input Green borders' y-positions (full vertical lines) ensure output Pinks and Maroons do not extend beyond x=0 or x=max, maintaining composition framing.
   - Unknown: Rules for occasional horizontal extensions of Green borders in output (e.g., bbox width>1 at specific y like bottoms of some Pink blocks); this occurs in both examples but not at every Pink block end, so inconsistent for full explanation.

4. **Input bottom-row Maroon splits → Output small internal Green placements**:
   - When the input bottom row (final y, e.g., y=10 or y=12) has split Maroon components (multiple separate bboxes with gaps, not a single full span), the output consistently places small single-pixel Green components at the starting x-position of each internal (non-leftmost) Maroon segment in that row.
   - These small Greens interact with the split Maroons by marking division points, preserving the gap positions (e.g., input gaps at certain x → Green at start of next Maroon).
   - In cases with no bottom-row splits (single full Maroon), no internal small Greens appear at bottom (only border Greens).
   - The leftmost bottom Maroon always interacts with the existing left Green border (no new small Green added).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects beyond Dark Red → Pink; no hole or silhouette-based effects, as all have holes=0; no consistent edge/hole transformations). Semantic meanings (e.g., "structural lines" vs. "accent lines") cannot be confirmed from data alone and are not forced.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....

 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

[2025-10-01 14:31:11] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

[2025-10-01 14:31:19] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), the following are **only** the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements that appear in **every** train puzzle (both 1 and 2). These are limited to direct, observable links such as positional adjacency leading to transformation, color mappings from input to output, or structural overlaps/fragmentations that recur identically. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon fills without adjacent interactions) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., varying Green placements not tied to a common trigger) are omitted. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes without a clear positional link) are noted as such.

1. **Dark Red horizontal blocks (input) → Pink vertical blocks (output)**:
   - Consistent interaction: Horizontal Dark Red blocks (1-3 units wide, in odd-numbered rows) in input always map to vertical Pink blocks (3 pixels high, 1 unit wide) in output.
   - Positional connection: Input Dark Red bbox y-center aligns with output Pink bbox y-start (e.g., input y=1 → output y=0-2; input y=3 → output y=2-4). This holds in both trains.
   - Adjacency effect: Dark Red blocks adjacent to Maroon horizontals in input result in Pink blocks overlapping or extending into Maroon areas in output, creating fragmentation.
   - Unknown: Pixel count of Pink is consistently 3, but no clear link to input Dark Red width (always 3 pixels in input too, but not explanatory for vertical shift).

2. **Green vertical borders (input sides) → Green horizontal extensions or isolated squares (output edges)**:
   - Consistent interaction: Thin vertical Green lines at grid edges (x=0 and x=grid_width, even rows) in input transform into short horizontal Green bars or squares (1-2 pixels wide) at similar edges in output.
   - Positional connection: Input Green at y=even (e.g., y=0,2) connects to output Green at y=even or y=even+2 (e.g., input y=0 → output y=0-2 or y=2; input y=8 → output y=8). This edge-to-edge persistence occurs in both trains.
   - Adjacency effect: Input Greens bordering Maroon rows lead to output Greens bordering or punctuating Maroon blocks, enforcing grid framing.
   - Unknown: Occasional isolated Green squares in output (e.g., at intersections) have no direct input positional match, so unlinked.

3. **Maroon horizontal rows (input) → Expanded/Overlapping Maroon blocks (output)**:
   - Consistent interaction: Full or partial Maroon horizontal bars (spanning most of row width, even rows) in input consolidate into larger vertical or rectangular Maroon blocks in output.
   - Positional connection: Input Maroon bbox y=even spans x=1 to x≈grid_width-1, which overlaps with output Maroon bboxes covering multiple y-levels (e.g., input y=2,4 → output y=0-8 spanning same x-range). This merging happens identically in both trains.
   - Adjacency effect: Maroon rows adjacent to Dark Red in input cause output Maroon to fragment around Pink positions, creating interconnected "maze-like" overlaps.
   - Unknown: Specific bbox expansions (e.g., from 14-17 pixels wide to 5-42 pixels in blocks) lack a consistent width-to-height ratio trigger.

No other connections are consistently observable across both train examples (e.g., hole counts are uniformly 0 with no interactive variation; some output Greens or Pinks have no direct input adjacency). Test input 1 shares similar elements (Dark Red horizontals, Maroon rows, Green borders) but no output provided for verification.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

                new_row[end] = 3
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), the following are **only** the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements that appear in **every** train puzzle (both 1 and 2). These are limited to direct, observable links such as positional adjacency leading to transformation, color mappings from input to output, or structural overlaps/fragmentations that recur identically. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon fills without adjacent interactions) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., varying Green placements not tied to a common trigger) are omitted. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes without a clear positional link) are noted as such.

1. **Dark Red horizontal blocks (input) → Pink vertical blocks (output)**:
   - Consistent interaction: Horizontal Dark Red blocks (1-3 units wide, in odd-numbered rows) in input always map to vertical Pink blocks (3 pixels high, 1 unit wide) in output.
   - Positional connection: Input Dark Red bbox y-center aligns with output Pink bbox y-start (e.g., input y=1 → output y=0-2; input y=3 → output y=2-4). This holds in both trains.
   - Adjacency effect: Dark Red blocks adjacent to Maroon horizontals in input result in Pink blocks overlapping or extending into Maroon areas in output, creating fragmentation.
   - Unknown: Pixel count of Pink is consistently 3, but no clear link to input Dark Red width (always 3 pixels in input too, but not explanatory for vertical shift).

2. **Green vertical borders (input sides) → Green horizontal extensions or isolated squares (output edges)**:
   - Consistent interaction: Thin vertical Green lines at grid edges (x=0 and x=grid_width, even rows) in input transform into short horizontal Green bars or squares (1-2 pixels wide) at similar edges in output.
   - Positional connection: Input Green at y=even (e.g., y=0,2) connects to output Green at y=even or y=even+2 (e.g., input y=0 → output y=0-2 or y=2; input y=8 → output y=8). This edge-to-edge persistence occurs in both trains.
   - Adjacency effect: Input Greens bordering Maroon rows lead to output Greens bordering or punctuating Maroon blocks, enforcing grid framing.
   - Unknown: Occasional isolated Green squares in output (e.g., at intersections) have no direct input positional match, so unlinked.

3. **Maroon horizontal rows (input) → Expanded/Overlapping Maroon blocks (output)**:
   - Consistent interaction: Full or partial Maroon horizontal bars (spanning most of row width, even rows) in input consolidate into larger vertical or rectangular Maroon blocks in output.
   - Positional connection: Input Maroon bbox y=even spans x=1 to x≈grid_width-1, which overlaps with output Maroon bboxes covering multiple y-levels (e.g., input y=2,4 → output y=0-8 spanning same x-range). This merging happens identically in both trains.
   - Adjacency effect: Maroon rows adjacent to Dark Red in input cause output Maroon to fragment around Pink positions, creating interconnected "maze-like" overlaps.
   - Unknown: Specific bbox expansions (e.g., from 14-17 pixels wide to 5-42 pixels in blocks) lack a consistent width-to-height ratio trigger.

No other connections are consistently observable across both train examples (e.g., hole counts are uniformly 0 with no interactive variation; some output Greens or Pinks have no direct input adjacency). Test input 1 shares similar elements (Dark Red horizontals, Maroon rows, Green borders) but no output provided for verification.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:35:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

[2025-10-01 14:35:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

    # (Full function body as in the program; it's helpful but complex—note the distance logic: left uses min_k <=5 for bottom, right uses dist <=4)
    # ...
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

                new_row[end] = 3
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:38:30] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_triple_sevens(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replace non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""
    if len(row) < 3:
        return row[:]
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i:i+3] == [7, 7, 7]:
            new_row[i:i+3] = [8, 6, 8]
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def overlay_sixes_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], row_index: int, num_rows: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlay 6 in even row positions where upper or lower row has 6."""
    new_row = base_row[:]
    has_upper = row_index > 0
    has_lower = row_index < num_rows - 1
    for col in range(n):
        overlay = False
        if has_upper and out[row_index - 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if has_lower and out[row_index + 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if overlay:
            new_row[col] = 6
    return new_row
```

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_triple_sevens(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replace non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""
    if len(row) < 3:
        return row[:]
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i:i+3] == [7, 7, 7]:
            new_row[i:i+3] = [8, 6, 8]
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def overlay_sixes_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], row_index: int, num_rows: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlay 6 in even row positions where upper or lower row has 6."""
    new_row = base_row[:]
    has_upper = row_index > 0
    has_lower = row_index < num_rows - 1
    for col in range(n):
        overlay = False
        if has_upper and out[row_index - 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if has_lower and out[row_index + 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if overlay:
            new_row[col] = 6
    return new_row
```

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:42:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_odd_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replaces non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""
    # (as provided in the program; helpful for indent creation in odd rows)
```

```python
def overlay_six_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlays 6 in even row where upper or lower adjacent row has 6 in the same column."""
    # (as provided; essential for vertical 6 propagation)
```

```python
def cap_internal_edges_with_three(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    """Caps left and right edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3 if segment has upper 6."""
    # (as provided; key for internal edge handling, but skips bottom right correctly)
```

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

[2025-10-01 14:42:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def overlay_sixes_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], row_index: int, num_rows: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlay 6 in even row positions where upper or lower row has 6."""
    new_row = base_row[:]
    has_upper = row_index > 0
    has_lower = row_index < num_rows - 1
    for col in range(n):
        overlay = False
        if has_upper and out[row_index - 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if has_lower and out[row_index + 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if overlay:
            new_row[col] = 6
    return new_row
```

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:46:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace sequences of [7,7,7] with [8,6,8] non-overlappingly, while even rows start with an 8/0 base (8 for non-zero input, 0 for zero), overlay 6s based on adjacent rows' 6s, cap edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s if the segment has an upper 6, handle borders specially (setting to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s, input values, and top/bottom status), and optionally extend border 3s inward if followed/preceded by 8s in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8]; shorter rows or non-matching sequences pass through unchanged; no other modifications to odd rows.
 * Even rows use the original input for base initialization and border checks but build on top of processed odd rows for overlays and caps; base is strictly 8 for any non-zero input cell, 0 for zero, ignoring processed values.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the exact same column in upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6; this can propagate vertically but only affects even rows.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments in even rows that are adjacent to 0s (left or right), and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row above any part of it; right cap is skipped in bottom row; this creates "capped" borders on islands of non-zeros.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex and position-specific: left/right edges of the entire row (if non-zero) are set to 3 or 8 based on whether there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left non-zero segment; right: closest upper 6 from the right, with distance thresholds like <=5 for left or <=4 for right to decide 3 vs 8); top row always gets 8 on borders; bottom row influences left/right to prefer 3 if upper 6 present; falls back to input 3 for 3 or 8 otherwise.
 * Extension of border 3s inward happens only in non-bottom even rows that have no zeros at all and length >=2: if border is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 one position inward (both sides independently).
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> borders -> extend); this ensures upper odd rows influence lower even rows correctly, but lower odd rows don't retroactively affect upper even rows.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: non-overlapping replacement in odd rows skips after replacement (i +=3); segment detection in caps scans contiguous non-zeros; border proximity uses min_k for left (any in left segment) but max_k/dist for right (closest from right end); input_row used only for base and border fallbacks, not for overlays/caps; zeros in even rows stay zero unless overlaid/capped/bordered; no diagonal or horizontal propagation beyond specified.
 * Edge cases: empty/short grids return unchanged; single-row (even or odd) handled appropriately; bottom row skips right caps and some extensions; full-8 rows without zeros enable extensions; multiple segments per row handled independently for caps but borders look at whole-row edges.
 * All considerations: vertical adjacency for 6 overlays (upper/lower); horizontal contiguity for segments/caps; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., left min_k <=5, right dist <=4); top/bottom special casing; no changes to odd rows after initial process; even rows can introduce 3s/6s where input was non-zero/zero but rules apply.

```

(Note: Other functions like initialize_even_base, handle_borders, extend_border_threes, and the main program orchestrator are also helpful for base setup, complex border logic, and final extensions, as they passed training; no object extraction functions are needed or present, as this is rule-based transformation without higher-level "objects" like blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like odd-row [7,7,7] replacement, even-row 8/0 base, vertical 6 overlays, segment-based 3 capping conditional on upper 6s, and basic border 3/8 decisions.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is precise and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically as expected; capping isolates segments correctly and respects bottom-row no-right-cap; extensions only apply to full non-zero non-bottom rows.
 * What didn't work: Border handling in handle_borders may have subtle flaws in proximity calculations (e.g., left uses any upper 6 in segment but thresholds like <=5; right uses closest from end with <=4 dist), potentially misapplying 3 vs 8 in test cases with distant upper 6s; extension skips rows with any zero, which might miss partial extensions; no handling for input values other than 0/3/7/8/6 assumed, could fail on unknowns.
 * The program processes even rows top-to-bottom, which works for training but might not account for lower odd rows influencing upper even overlays if order changed (but current order matches needs).
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one shows partial understanding: core transformations pass training, but test output suggests possible over-application of 3s or missed extensions in complex layouts.
 * Function handle_borders is helpful but overly complex and potentially buggy in right-border distance (searches from right but breaks on first 6, using dist = n-1 - right_max_k); could be refined for accuracy.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though cap_adjacent_zeros skips if no upper 6 even if segment needs capping otherwise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 18-row by 17-column grid with patterns of 8s forming backgrounds/islands, 6s in vertical alignments (e.g., columns 10-11 have recurring 6s across rows), 3s capping edges of segments (e.g., row 4 [bottom]: 3 at ends of main island; row 10: 3s at positions 1,9,16), and 0s as gaps/spacers; odd rows have 8/6 patterns from 7 replacements, even rows show overlays and caps.
 * The test output makes sense overall as it follows the rules: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 from likely [7,7,7]; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row1/3; row 4 (even) has 3 caps at ends where adjacent to 0s and upper row3 has 6s; borders often 8 or 3 based on proximity (e.g., row 4 right 3 near upper 6 at col13).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even) has a 0 at col10 but surrounding 8s/3s suggest possible missed overlay from lower row11 (all 0s, so no); row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but input/base might not justify if no adjacent 6s; row 18 (even, bottom?) shows 3 caps but if bottom, right cap should be skipped yet has 3 at end—wait, grid has 18 rows, if 0-indexed row17 is bottom, but listing suggests possible miscount; extensions seem missing in some full-8 rows like row 8 (has 6s, no extend); differences from expected: more 3s on left borders than anticipated (e.g., row 4 starts with 3, but if no close upper 6, should be 8); unknown why row 10 has isolated 0 at col10 amid 8s—possibly uncapped zero not adjacent to upper 6.
 * The test output is mostly consistent with rules but likely incorrect in border decisions (overuse of 3s where dist > threshold) and possible missed lower influences on overlays (since even processed top-down, lower odd rows like row13 affect row12 overlay? Wait, code uses out[j+1] which is original until processed, but odd processed first so yes); to handle test, update border thresholds or search logic for right side.

[2025-10-01 14:46:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_triple_sevens(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replace non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""
    if len(row) < 3:
        return row[:]
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i:i+3] == [7, 7, 7]:
            new_row[i:i+3] = [8, 6, 8]
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def overlay_sixes_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], row_index: int, num_rows: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlay 6 in even row positions where upper or lower row has 6."""
    new_row = base_row[:]
    has_upper = row_index > 0
    has_lower = row_index < num_rows - 1
    for col in range(n):
        overlay = False
        if has_upper and out[row_index - 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if has_lower and out[row_index + 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if overlay:
            new_row[col] = 6
    return new_row
```

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

    # (as provided; key for internal edge handling, but skips bottom right correctly)
```

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace sequences of [7,7,7] with [8,6,8] non-overlappingly, while even rows start with an 8/0 base (8 for non-zero input, 0 for zero), overlay 6s based on adjacent rows' 6s, cap edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s if the segment has an upper 6, handle borders specially (setting to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s, input values, and top/bottom status), and optionally extend border 3s inward if followed/preceded by 8s in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8]; shorter rows or non-matching sequences pass through unchanged; no other modifications to odd rows.
 * Even rows use the original input for base initialization and border checks but build on top of processed odd rows for overlays and caps; base is strictly 8 for any non-zero input cell, 0 for zero, ignoring processed values.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the exact same column in upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6; this can propagate vertically but only affects even rows.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments in even rows that are adjacent to 0s (left or right), and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row above any part of it; right cap is skipped in bottom row; this creates "capped" borders on islands of non-zeros.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex and position-specific: left/right edges of the entire row (if non-zero) are set to 3 or 8 based on whether there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left non-zero segment; right: closest upper 6 from the right, with distance thresholds like <=5 for left or <=4 for right to decide 3 vs 8); top row always gets 8 on borders; bottom row influences left/right to prefer 3 if upper 6 present; falls back to input 3 for 3 or 8 otherwise.
 * Extension of border 3s inward happens only in non-bottom even rows that have no zeros at all and length >=2: if border is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 one position inward (both sides independently).
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> borders -> extend); this ensures upper odd rows influence lower even rows correctly, but lower odd rows don't retroactively affect upper even rows.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: non-overlapping replacement in odd rows skips after replacement (i +=3); segment detection in caps scans contiguous non-zeros; border proximity uses min_k for left (any in left segment) but max_k/dist for right (closest from right end); input_row used only for base and border fallbacks, not for overlays/caps; zeros in even rows stay zero unless overlaid/capped/bordered; no diagonal or horizontal propagation beyond specified.
 * Edge cases: empty/short grids return unchanged; single-row (even or odd) handled appropriately; bottom row skips right caps and some extensions; full-8 rows without zeros enable extensions; multiple segments per row handled independently for caps but borders look at whole-row edges.
 * All considerations: vertical adjacency for 6 overlays (upper/lower); horizontal contiguity for segments/caps; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., left min_k <=5, right dist <=4); top/bottom special casing; no changes to odd rows after initial process; even rows can introduce 3s/6s where input was non-zero/zero but rules apply.

(Note: Other functions like initialize_even_base, handle_borders, extend_border_threes, and the main program orchestrator are also helpful for base setup, complex border logic, and final extensions, as they passed training; no object extraction functions are needed or present, as this is rule-based transformation without higher-level "objects" like blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like odd-row [7,7,7] replacement, even-row 8/0 base, vertical 6 overlays, segment-based 3 capping conditional on upper 6s, and basic border 3/8 decisions.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is precise and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically as expected; capping isolates segments correctly and respects bottom-row no-right-cap; extensions only apply to full non-zero non-bottom rows.
 * What didn't work: Border handling in handle_borders may have subtle flaws in proximity calculations (e.g., left uses any upper 6 in segment but thresholds like <=5; right uses closest from end with <=4 dist), potentially misapplying 3 vs 8 in test cases with distant upper 6s; extension skips rows with any zero, which might miss partial extensions; no handling for input values other than 0/3/7/8/6 assumed, could fail on unknowns.
 * The program processes even rows top-to-bottom, which works for training but might not account for lower odd rows influencing upper even overlays if order changed (but current order matches needs).
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one shows partial understanding: core transformations pass training, but test output suggests possible over-application of 3s or missed extensions in complex layouts.
 * Function handle_borders is helpful but overly complex and potentially buggy in right-border distance (searches from right but breaks on first 6, using dist = n-1 - right_max_k); could be refined for accuracy.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though cap_adjacent_zeros skips if no upper 6 even if segment needs capping otherwise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 18-row by 17-column grid with patterns of 8s forming backgrounds/islands, 6s in vertical alignments (e.g., columns 10-11 have recurring 6s across rows), 3s capping edges of segments (e.g., row 4 [bottom]: 3 at ends of main island; row 10: 3s at positions 1,9,16), and 0s as gaps/spacers; odd rows have 8/6 patterns from 7 replacements, even rows show overlays and caps.
 * The test output makes sense overall as it follows the rules: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 from likely [7,7,7]; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row1/3; row 4 (even) has 3 caps at ends where adjacent to 0s and upper row3 has 6s; borders often 8 or 3 based on proximity (e.g., row 4 right 3 near upper 6 at col13).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even) has a 0 at col10 but surrounding 8s/3s suggest possible missed overlay from lower row11 (all 0s, so no); row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but input/base might not justify if no adjacent 6s; row 18 (even, bottom?) shows 3 caps but if bottom, right cap should be skipped yet has 3 at end—wait, grid has 18 rows, if 0-indexed row17 is bottom, but listing suggests possible miscount; extensions seem missing in some full-8 rows like row 8 (has 6s, no extend); differences from expected: more 3s on left borders than anticipated (e.g., row 4 starts with 3, but if no close upper 6, should be 8); unknown why row 10 has isolated 0 at col10 amid 8s—possibly uncapped zero not adjacent to upper 6.
 * The test output is mostly consistent with rules but likely incorrect in border decisions (overuse of 3s where dist > threshold) and possible missed lower influences on overlays (since even processed top-down, lower odd rows like row13 affect row12 overlay? Wait, code uses out[j+1] which is original until processed, but odd processed first so yes); to handle test, update border thresholds or search logic for right side.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:48:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like walls, paths, or patterns in a grid-based image) by applying row-specific rules: odd rows undergo pattern replacements, while even rows are initialized, overlaid, capped, and bordered according to adjacency and conditions involving 6s and 0s. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually matches an expected pattern, such as a stylized drawing or maze, by simulating rules that create borders (3s), paths (6s), fills (8s), and empties (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of [7,7,7] must be replaced with [8,6,8] to create "bridges" or paths; this is processed first and independently for all odd rows.
 * Even rows: Start with a base of 8 for non-zero input cells and 0 for zeros; then overlay 6s in positions where the upper or lower row (odd) has a 6 in the same column, simulating vertical continuity.
 * Segment capping in even rows: For non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left/right edges with 3 if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skip right cap on bottom row; this creates "guarded" edges but only for segments influenced by upper 6s.
 * Border handling in even rows: Left and right edges are set to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s (e.g., if a 6 is within ~5 positions on left or ~4 on right, use 3; otherwise 8), input values (prefer 3 if input is 3), and row position (top rows default to 8, bottom may force 3); this is separate from segment capping and focuses on the grid's outer borders.
 * Inward extension: In non-bottom even rows without zeros, extend border 3s inward by one position if followed by an 8, to "thicken" borders subtly.
 * Global considerations: Process odd rows fully before even rows; even rows are done top-to-bottom, relying on already-processed odd rows above; handle edge cases like single-row grids, zero-length rows, top/bottom status, and varying segment lengths; subtle misses include incorrect proximity distances (e.g., left uses <=5, right <=4), not skipping right caps only on bottom, or failing to check for upper 6s per segment/border.
 * Input assumptions: Grid has uniform width n, rows alternate even/odd starting at 0; numbers include 0 (empty), 3 (border), 6 (path), 7 (pre-replacement), 8 (fill); no overlapping replacements or backward passes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Borders check min/max k for 6 proximity differently on left/right; extensions only if no zeros and n>=2; overlays use already-processed adjacent rows, so order matters; caps and borders can interact (e.g., a border 3 might be overwritten or extended).

(The above functions are helpful for core transformations; others like set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_border_threes_inward are also useful but overly specific to proximity logic, which may need tuning; initialize_even_row_base is simple and correct but basic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row replacements, even-row basing, 6 overlays, and basic capping/bordering.
 * Worked well: Pattern replacement in odd rows is non-overlapping and forward-only, avoiding infinite loops; overlays correctly propagate 6s vertically using processed adjacent rows.
 * Did not work fully: Border proximity logic (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be arbitrary or incorrect for some cases, as it hardcodes distances that might not generalize; right border search starts from end but breaks on first 6, potentially missing closer ones if not reversed properly.
 * Capping skips right edges only on bottom, which is good, but may overcap if segments overlap with borders; extensions only apply if no zeros, which prevents artifacts but might miss partial fills.
 * Function set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are helpful but complex and potentially buggy in min/max k calculations (e.g., right_max_k init to -1, loop direction); they handle top/bottom and input_3 fallbacks correctly.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges correctly identifies segments and checks upper 6s per segment, but doesn't handle if upper row isn't processed yet (though main program orders it right).
 * Function extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and mostly correct but skips if any zero exists, which could prevent needed extensions in mixed rows.
 * Overall, the main program structure (odd first, then even top-to-bottom) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but earlier attempts (implied) might have missed order or proximity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a coherent 18-row grid (9 even, 9 odd) with consistent patterns: odd rows have isolated [8,6,8] amid 0s, even rows have fills of 8s interrupted by 6s and bordered by 3s, creating vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking across rows).
 * It looks mostly correct and sensible: Overlays propagate 6s properly (e.g., row 1's 6 at col 10 aligns with row 0's 6 there; row 3's [8,6,8] at cols 12-14 influences row 2 and 4); borders use 3s at edges where upper 6s are proximal (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at both ends extended inward).
 * Potential issues: Row 4 has a 3 at col 0, 8s, a 0 at col 7, then 3 at col 8, suggesting capping worked but the inner 3 might be from border logic overlapping a segment; row 10 has 3 at col 0, but a 0 at col 10 breaks continuity, and 3 at end—capping seems applied but extension skipped due to zero, which is correct per rules.
 * Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but no 3 caps visible around isolated 6s (since 6 overlays on base 8, not creating new segments adjacent to 0s); this matches rules as overlays don't trigger capping unless edges touch 0s with upper 6 condition.
 * Row 17 (odd) has scattered [8,6,8] and 0s, likely from input 7s replaced correctly; overall, the output visually forms connected paths/borders (e.g., vertical 6 channels at cols 7-8, 10-12), suggesting it makes sense for a puzzle like drawing outlines or mazes, but without expected output, can't confirm if border distances or specific 3 placements (e.g., row 11 all 0s, no influence) are exact—differences might be in unhandled input variations like non-7 patterns in odd rows.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 14:48:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_triple_sevens(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replace non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""
    if len(row) < 3:
        return row[:]
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i:i+3] == [7, 7, 7]:
            new_row[i:i+3] = [8, 6, 8]
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def overlay_sixes_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], row_index: int, num_rows: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlay 6 in even row positions where upper or lower row has 6."""
    new_row = base_row[:]
    has_upper = row_index > 0
    has_lower = row_index < num_rows - 1
    for col in range(n):
        overlay = False
        if has_upper and out[row_index - 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if has_lower and out[row_index + 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if overlay:
            new_row[col] = 6
    return new_row
```

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace sequences of [7,7,7] with [8,6,8] non-overlappingly, while even rows start with an 8/0 base (8 for non-zero input, 0 for zero), overlay 6s based on adjacent rows' 6s, cap edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s if the segment has an upper 6, handle borders specially (setting to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s, input values, and top/bottom status), and optionally extend border 3s inward if followed/preceded by 8s in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8]; shorter rows or non-matching sequences pass through unchanged; no other modifications to odd rows.
 * Even rows use the original input for base initialization and border checks but build on top of processed odd rows for overlays and caps; base is strictly 8 for any non-zero input cell, 0 for zero, ignoring processed values.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the exact same column in upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6; this can propagate vertically but only affects even rows.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments in even rows that are adjacent to 0s (left or right), and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row above any part of it; right cap is skipped in bottom row; this creates "capped" borders on islands of non-zeros.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex and position-specific: left/right edges of the entire row (if non-zero) are set to 3 or 8 based on whether there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left non-zero segment; right: closest upper 6 from the right, with distance thresholds like <=5 for left or <=4 for right to decide 3 vs 8); top row always gets 8 on borders; bottom row influences left/right to prefer 3 if upper 6 present; falls back to input 3 for 3 or 8 otherwise.
 * Extension of border 3s inward happens only in non-bottom even rows that have no zeros at all and length >=2: if border is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 one position inward (both sides independently).
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> borders -> extend); this ensures upper odd rows influence lower even rows correctly, but lower odd rows don't retroactively affect upper even rows.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: non-overlapping replacement in odd rows skips after replacement (i +=3); segment detection in caps scans contiguous non-zeros; border proximity uses min_k for left (any in left segment) but max_k/dist for right (closest from right end); input_row used only for base and border fallbacks, not for overlays/caps; zeros in even rows stay zero unless overlaid/capped/bordered; no diagonal or horizontal propagation beyond specified.
 * Edge cases: empty/short grids return unchanged; single-row (even or odd) handled appropriately; bottom row skips right caps and some extensions; full-8 rows without zeros enable extensions; multiple segments per row handled independently for caps but borders look at whole-row edges.
 * All considerations: vertical adjacency for 6 overlays (upper/lower); horizontal contiguity for segments/caps; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., left min_k <=5, right dist <=4); top/bottom special casing; no changes to odd rows after initial process; even rows can introduce 3s/6s where input was non-zero/zero but rules apply.

(Note: Other functions like initialize_even_base, handle_borders, extend_border_threes, and the main program orchestrator are also helpful for base setup, complex border logic, and final extensions, as they passed training; no object extraction functions are needed or present, as this is rule-based transformation without higher-level "objects" like blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like odd-row [7,7,7] replacement, even-row 8/0 base, vertical 6 overlays, segment-based 3 capping conditional on upper 6s, and basic border 3/8 decisions.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is precise and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically as expected; capping isolates segments correctly and respects bottom-row no-right-cap; extensions only apply to full non-zero non-bottom rows.
 * What didn't work: Border handling in handle_borders may have subtle flaws in proximity calculations (e.g., left uses any upper 6 in segment but thresholds like <=5; right uses closest from end with <=4 dist), potentially misapplying 3 vs 8 in test cases with distant upper 6s; extension skips rows with any zero, which might miss partial extensions; no handling for input values other than 0/3/7/8/6 assumed, could fail on unknowns.
 * The program processes even rows top-to-bottom, which works for training but might not account for lower odd rows influencing upper even overlays if order changed (but current order matches needs).
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one shows partial understanding: core transformations pass training, but test output suggests possible over-application of 3s or missed extensions in complex layouts.
 * Function handle_borders is helpful but overly complex and potentially buggy in right-border distance (searches from right but breaks on first 6, using dist = n-1 - right_max_k); could be refined for accuracy.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though cap_adjacent_zeros skips if no upper 6 even if segment needs capping otherwise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 18-row by 17-column grid with patterns of 8s forming backgrounds/islands, 6s in vertical alignments (e.g., columns 10-11 have recurring 6s across rows), 3s capping edges of segments (e.g., row 4 [bottom]: 3 at ends of main island; row 10: 3s at positions 1,9,16), and 0s as gaps/spacers; odd rows have 8/6 patterns from 7 replacements, even rows show overlays and caps.
 * The test output makes sense overall as it follows the rules: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 from likely [7,7,7]; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row1/3; row 4 (even) has 3 caps at ends where adjacent to 0s and upper row3 has 6s; borders often 8 or 3 based on proximity (e.g., row 4 right 3 near upper 6 at col13).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even) has a 0 at col10 but surrounding 8s/3s suggest possible missed overlay from lower row11 (all 0s, so no); row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but input/base might not justify if no adjacent 6s; row 18 (even, bottom?) shows 3 caps but if bottom, right cap should be skipped yet has 3 at end—wait, grid has 18 rows, if 0-indexed row17 is bottom, but listing suggests possible miscount; extensions seem missing in some full-8 rows like row 8 (has 6s, no extend); differences from expected: more 3s on left borders than anticipated (e.g., row 4 starts with 3, but if no close upper 6, should be 8); unknown why row 10 has isolated 0 at col10 amid 8s—possibly uncapped zero not adjacent to upper 6.
 * The test output is mostly consistent with rules but likely incorrect in border decisions (overuse of 3s where dist > threshold) and possible missed lower influences on overlays (since even processed top-down, lower odd rows like row13 affect row12 overlay? Wait, code uses out[j+1] which is original until processed, but odd processed first so yes); to handle test, update border thresholds or search logic for right side.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like walls, paths, or patterns in a grid-based image) by applying row-specific rules: odd rows undergo pattern replacements, while even rows are initialized, overlaid, capped, and bordered according to adjacency and conditions involving 6s and 0s. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually matches an expected pattern, such as a stylized drawing or maze, by simulating rules that create borders (3s), paths (6s), fills (8s), and empties (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of [7,7,7] must be replaced with [8,6,8] to create "bridges" or paths; this is processed first and independently for all odd rows.
 * Even rows: Start with a base of 8 for non-zero input cells and 0 for zeros; then overlay 6s in positions where the upper or lower row (odd) has a 6 in the same column, simulating vertical continuity.
 * Segment capping in even rows: For non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left/right edges with 3 if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skip right cap on bottom row; this creates "guarded" edges but only for segments influenced by upper 6s.
 * Border handling in even rows: Left and right edges are set to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s (e.g., if a 6 is within ~5 positions on left or ~4 on right, use 3; otherwise 8), input values (prefer 3 if input is 3), and row position (top rows default to 8, bottom may force 3); this is separate from segment capping and focuses on the grid's outer borders.
 * Inward extension: In non-bottom even rows without zeros, extend border 3s inward by one position if followed by an 8, to "thicken" borders subtly.
 * Global considerations: Process odd rows fully before even rows; even rows are done top-to-bottom, relying on already-processed odd rows above; handle edge cases like single-row grids, zero-length rows, top/bottom status, and varying segment lengths; subtle misses include incorrect proximity distances (e.g., left uses <=5, right <=4), not skipping right caps only on bottom, or failing to check for upper 6s per segment/border.
 * Input assumptions: Grid has uniform width n, rows alternate even/odd starting at 0; numbers include 0 (empty), 3 (border), 6 (path), 7 (pre-replacement), 8 (fill); no overlapping replacements or backward passes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Borders check min/max k for 6 proximity differently on left/right; extensions only if no zeros and n>=2; overlays use already-processed adjacent rows, so order matters; caps and borders can interact (e.g., a border 3 might be overwritten or extended).

(The above functions are helpful for core transformations; others like set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_border_threes_inward are also useful but overly specific to proximity logic, which may need tuning; initialize_even_row_base is simple and correct but basic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row replacements, even-row basing, 6 overlays, and basic capping/bordering.
 * Worked well: Pattern replacement in odd rows is non-overlapping and forward-only, avoiding infinite loops; overlays correctly propagate 6s vertically using processed adjacent rows.
 * Did not work fully: Border proximity logic (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be arbitrary or incorrect for some cases, as it hardcodes distances that might not generalize; right border search starts from end but breaks on first 6, potentially missing closer ones if not reversed properly.
 * Capping skips right edges only on bottom, which is good, but may overcap if segments overlap with borders; extensions only apply if no zeros, which prevents artifacts but might miss partial fills.
 * Function set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are helpful but complex and potentially buggy in min/max k calculations (e.g., right_max_k init to -1, loop direction); they handle top/bottom and input_3 fallbacks correctly.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges correctly identifies segments and checks upper 6s per segment, but doesn't handle if upper row isn't processed yet (though main program orders it right).
 * Function extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and mostly correct but skips if any zero exists, which could prevent needed extensions in mixed rows.
 * Overall, the main program structure (odd first, then even top-to-bottom) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but earlier attempts (implied) might have missed order or proximity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a coherent 18-row grid (9 even, 9 odd) with consistent patterns: odd rows have isolated [8,6,8] amid 0s, even rows have fills of 8s interrupted by 6s and bordered by 3s, creating vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking across rows).
 * It looks mostly correct and sensible: Overlays propagate 6s properly (e.g., row 1's 6 at col 10 aligns with row 0's 6 there; row 3's [8,6,8] at cols 12-14 influences row 2 and 4); borders use 3s at edges where upper 6s are proximal (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at both ends extended inward).
 * Potential issues: Row 4 has a 3 at col 0, 8s, a 0 at col 7, then 3 at col 8, suggesting capping worked but the inner 3 might be from border logic overlapping a segment; row 10 has 3 at col 0, but a 0 at col 10 breaks continuity, and 3 at end—capping seems applied but extension skipped due to zero, which is correct per rules.
 * Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but no 3 caps visible around isolated 6s (since 6 overlays on base 8, not creating new segments adjacent to 0s); this matches rules as overlays don't trigger capping unless edges touch 0s with upper 6 condition.
 * Row 17 (odd) has scattered [8,6,8] and 0s, likely from input 7s replaced correctly; overall, the output visually forms connected paths/borders (e.g., vertical 6 channels at cols 7-8, 10-12), suggesting it makes sense for a puzzle like drawing outlines or mazes, but without expected output, can't confirm if border distances or specific 3 placements (e.g., row 11 all 0s, no influence) are exact—differences might be in unhandled input variations like non-7 patterns in odd rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:50:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8], while even rows start with a base of 8s (or 0s where input is 0), overlay 6s from adjacent rows, cap non-zero segment edges adjacent to 0s with 3s under conditions involving upper-row 6s, handle left/right borders specially based on proximity to upper 6s and input values, and extend border 3s inward in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only replace exact non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8,6,8]; do not touch other values or overlapping patterns.
 * Even rows use the original input grid (g) for base initialization and border decisions, but overlays and caps use the updated output grid (out) for adjacency checks to propagate changes from previously processed rows.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the upper or lower row (in out) has a 6 in the same column; this can create new 6s that affect later capping or bordering.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row (for non-top rows); skip right-edge capping on bottom rows; this prevents over-capping in isolated segments without upper influence.
 * Border handling (left/right) is complex: for non-top rows, set to 3 if there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left segment length, ideally min distance <=5; right: max distance <=4 from edge), or fall back to input value (3 if input is 3, else 8); top rows always get 8 on borders; bottom rows prioritize 3 if upper 6 condition met.
 * Extend border 3s inward by one position only if the next cell is 8, the row has no 0s, it's not the bottom row, and n >=2; this creates "thick" borders without zeros.
 * Process odd rows before even rows, and even rows top-to-bottom to ensure propagation; input g is preserved for base/border logic, but out is updated in place.
 * Subtle edge cases: zero segments skip all processing; top row has no upper, so no 6-based capping/bordering (defaults to 8s); bottom row skips right capping and some extensions; proximity calculations for borders use min/max distances to nearest upper 6 within the border segment; overlapping rules (e.g., overlay then cap) must be applied in sequence without revisiting.
 * All rows assume uniform width n; empty or single-row grids return unchanged; no diagonal or multi-row pattern matching beyond vertical adjacency for 6s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (full match on all rules like triple-7 replacement, 6 overlays, 3 capping, border setting, and inward extension).
 * What worked: Odd-row processing is solid (non-overlapping 7->868); even-row base init preserves input zeros correctly; 6 overlay propagates vertically as expected; capping applies 3s only to qualifying segment edges (e.g., adjacent to 0 with upper 6); borders use input fallbacks and distance-based 6 proximity accurately for training cases.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, several even rows show unexpected 3s or 8s on borders/internal positions (e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has internal 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 check, and right border 3 despite potentially distant upper 6); row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a mid-row 3 at col 9 that skips zero but may violate no-extension-over-zero; row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] overlays 6s correctly but lacks expected 3 caps around isolated 6s if adjacent to implied zeros (unknown if input has zeros there); overall, test output mismatches expected by having asymmetric border 3s (e.g., left 3 but right 8 in some rows where upper 6 proximity should symmetrize) and possible over-extension of 3s inward past 6s (e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends left/right 3s but interacts oddly with central 6).
 * Subtle misses in this attempt: Left border min_k <=5 threshold may be too loose for test (causing extra 3s); right border dist <=4 may under-cap in wider segments; overlay uses lower row prematurely (before its processing, leading to missing 6s from bottom-up propagation); cap function skips if no upper 6 but test may need input-based fallback; no function for extracting/validating full segments across rows (would help debug propagation).
 * Function `overlay_sixes_from_adjacents` is helpful but potentially broken for bottom rows (accesses unprocessed lower out); `set_left_border` has redundant while loop (inefficient but correct); `set_right_border` uses break after first 6 but computes max_k incorrectly if multiple (only takes last in reverse scan); no unhelpful functions noted, but main program assumes uniform n without checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., visible patterns of 6s overlaying vertically, 3s capping some zero-adjacent segments, border 3s in non-top rows, inward extensions like double 3s on edges without zeros) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Specific issues: Row 4 ends with [...,8,6,8,8,3] where right 3 caps a segment adjacent to zero, but if upper row (row 3) has no 6 over that segment, it shouldn't cap (unknown input, but generated 3 seems over-applied); row 10 has [...,3,0,8,... ,3] with left/mid/right 3s, but the 0 breaks the segment, so mid 3 at col9 shouldn't exist if it's not an edge; row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0] overlays 6 correctly from adjacents but lacks any 3 caps on its short non-zero segment edges, which should get 3s if upper (row 11) has 6 nearby (row 11 is all 0s in generated, but propagation may be off); row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] shows internal 3 at col8 splitting a zero, but capping should only edge non-zero segments, not insert mid-zero; asymmetries like row 2 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] having two 6s without border impact, while row 16 has three 6s but no 3s, suggest inconsistent proximity/dist thresholds; expected output should have more uniform border 3s (e.g., full left/right 3s where upper 6s are central) and no 3s over/near 6s unless edge-capping; the output propagates some 7-replacements (implied in odd rows like row 1,3) but test grid seems to lack 7s, so focus on even-row rules failing subtly (e.g., unknown why row 6 extends to [3,3,...,3,3] but includes a 6 without capping around it).

[2025-10-01 14:50:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_triple_sevens(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replace non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""
    if len(row) < 3:
        return row[:]
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i:i+3] == [7, 7, 7]:
            new_row[i:i+3] = [8, 6, 8]
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def overlay_sixes_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], row_index: int, num_rows: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlay 6 in even row positions where upper or lower row has 6."""
    new_row = base_row[:]
    has_upper = row_index > 0
    has_lower = row_index < num_rows - 1
    for col in range(n):
        overlay = False
        if has_upper and out[row_index - 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if has_lower and out[row_index + 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if overlay:
            new_row[col] = 6
    return new_row
```

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

    # (as provided; key for internal edge handling, but skips bottom right correctly)
```

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace sequences of [7,7,7] with [8,6,8] non-overlappingly, while even rows start with an 8/0 base (8 for non-zero input, 0 for zero), overlay 6s based on adjacent rows' 6s, cap edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s if the segment has an upper 6, handle borders specially (setting to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s, input values, and top/bottom status), and optionally extend border 3s inward if followed/preceded by 8s in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8]; shorter rows or non-matching sequences pass through unchanged; no other modifications to odd rows.
 * Even rows use the original input for base initialization and border checks but build on top of processed odd rows for overlays and caps; base is strictly 8 for any non-zero input cell, 0 for zero, ignoring processed values.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the exact same column in upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6; this can propagate vertically but only affects even rows.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments in even rows that are adjacent to 0s (left or right), and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row above any part of it; right cap is skipped in bottom row; this creates "capped" borders on islands of non-zeros.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex and position-specific: left/right edges of the entire row (if non-zero) are set to 3 or 8 based on whether there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left non-zero segment; right: closest upper 6 from the right, with distance thresholds like <=5 for left or <=4 for right to decide 3 vs 8); top row always gets 8 on borders; bottom row influences left/right to prefer 3 if upper 6 present; falls back to input 3 for 3 or 8 otherwise.
 * Extension of border 3s inward happens only in non-bottom even rows that have no zeros at all and length >=2: if border is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 one position inward (both sides independently).
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> borders -> extend); this ensures upper odd rows influence lower even rows correctly, but lower odd rows don't retroactively affect upper even rows.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: non-overlapping replacement in odd rows skips after replacement (i +=3); segment detection in caps scans contiguous non-zeros; border proximity uses min_k for left (any in left segment) but max_k/dist for right (closest from right end); input_row used only for base and border fallbacks, not for overlays/caps; zeros in even rows stay zero unless overlaid/capped/bordered; no diagonal or horizontal propagation beyond specified.
 * Edge cases: empty/short grids return unchanged; single-row (even or odd) handled appropriately; bottom row skips right caps and some extensions; full-8 rows without zeros enable extensions; multiple segments per row handled independently for caps but borders look at whole-row edges.
 * All considerations: vertical adjacency for 6 overlays (upper/lower); horizontal contiguity for segments/caps; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., left min_k <=5, right dist <=4); top/bottom special casing; no changes to odd rows after initial process; even rows can introduce 3s/6s where input was non-zero/zero but rules apply.

(Note: Other functions like initialize_even_base, handle_borders, extend_border_threes, and the main program orchestrator are also helpful for base setup, complex border logic, and final extensions, as they passed training; no object extraction functions are needed or present, as this is rule-based transformation without higher-level "objects" like blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like odd-row [7,7,7] replacement, even-row 8/0 base, vertical 6 overlays, segment-based 3 capping conditional on upper 6s, and basic border 3/8 decisions.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is precise and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically as expected; capping isolates segments correctly and respects bottom-row no-right-cap; extensions only apply to full non-zero non-bottom rows.
 * What didn't work: Border handling in handle_borders may have subtle flaws in proximity calculations (e.g., left uses any upper 6 in segment but thresholds like <=5; right uses closest from end with <=4 dist), potentially misapplying 3 vs 8 in test cases with distant upper 6s; extension skips rows with any zero, which might miss partial extensions; no handling for input values other than 0/3/7/8/6 assumed, could fail on unknowns.
 * The program processes even rows top-to-bottom, which works for training but might not account for lower odd rows influencing upper even overlays if order changed (but current order matches needs).
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one shows partial understanding: core transformations pass training, but test output suggests possible over-application of 3s or missed extensions in complex layouts.
 * Function handle_borders is helpful but overly complex and potentially buggy in right-border distance (searches from right but breaks on first 6, using dist = n-1 - right_max_k); could be refined for accuracy.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though cap_adjacent_zeros skips if no upper 6 even if segment needs capping otherwise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 18-row by 17-column grid with patterns of 8s forming backgrounds/islands, 6s in vertical alignments (e.g., columns 10-11 have recurring 6s across rows), 3s capping edges of segments (e.g., row 4 [bottom]: 3 at ends of main island; row 10: 3s at positions 1,9,16), and 0s as gaps/spacers; odd rows have 8/6 patterns from 7 replacements, even rows show overlays and caps.
 * The test output makes sense overall as it follows the rules: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 from likely [7,7,7]; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row1/3; row 4 (even) has 3 caps at ends where adjacent to 0s and upper row3 has 6s; borders often 8 or 3 based on proximity (e.g., row 4 right 3 near upper 6 at col13).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even) has a 0 at col10 but surrounding 8s/3s suggest possible missed overlay from lower row11 (all 0s, so no); row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but input/base might not justify if no adjacent 6s; row 18 (even, bottom?) shows 3 caps but if bottom, right cap should be skipped yet has 3 at end—wait, grid has 18 rows, if 0-indexed row17 is bottom, but listing suggests possible miscount; extensions seem missing in some full-8 rows like row 8 (has 6s, no extend); differences from expected: more 3s on left borders than anticipated (e.g., row 4 starts with 3, but if no close upper 6, should be 8); unknown why row 10 has isolated 0 at col10 amid 8s—possibly uncapped zero not adjacent to upper 6.
 * The test output is mostly consistent with rules but likely incorrect in border decisions (overuse of 3s where dist > threshold) and possible missed lower influences on overlays (since even processed top-down, lower odd rows like row13 affect row12 overlay? Wait, code uses out[j+1] which is original until processed, but odd processed first so yes); to handle test, update border thresholds or search logic for right side.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8], while even rows start with a base of 8s (or 0s where input is 0), overlay 6s from adjacent rows, cap non-zero segment edges adjacent to 0s with 3s under conditions involving upper-row 6s, handle left/right borders specially based on proximity to upper 6s and input values, and extend border 3s inward in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only replace exact non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8,6,8]; do not touch other values or overlapping patterns.
 * Even rows use the original input grid (g) for base initialization and border decisions, but overlays and caps use the updated output grid (out) for adjacency checks to propagate changes from previously processed rows.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the upper or lower row (in out) has a 6 in the same column; this can create new 6s that affect later capping or bordering.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row (for non-top rows); skip right-edge capping on bottom rows; this prevents over-capping in isolated segments without upper influence.
 * Border handling (left/right) is complex: for non-top rows, set to 3 if there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left segment length, ideally min distance <=5; right: max distance <=4 from edge), or fall back to input value (3 if input is 3, else 8); top rows always get 8 on borders; bottom rows prioritize 3 if upper 6 condition met.
 * Extend border 3s inward by one position only if the next cell is 8, the row has no 0s, it's not the bottom row, and n >=2; this creates "thick" borders without zeros.
 * Process odd rows before even rows, and even rows top-to-bottom to ensure propagation; input g is preserved for base/border logic, but out is updated in place.
 * Subtle edge cases: zero segments skip all processing; top row has no upper, so no 6-based capping/bordering (defaults to 8s); bottom row skips right capping and some extensions; proximity calculations for borders use min/max distances to nearest upper 6 within the border segment; overlapping rules (e.g., overlay then cap) must be applied in sequence without revisiting.
 * All rows assume uniform width n; empty or single-row grids return unchanged; no diagonal or multi-row pattern matching beyond vertical adjacency for 6s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (full match on all rules like triple-7 replacement, 6 overlays, 3 capping, border setting, and inward extension).
 * What worked: Odd-row processing is solid (non-overlapping 7->868); even-row base init preserves input zeros correctly; 6 overlay propagates vertically as expected; capping applies 3s only to qualifying segment edges (e.g., adjacent to 0 with upper 6); borders use input fallbacks and distance-based 6 proximity accurately for training cases.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, several even rows show unexpected 3s or 8s on borders/internal positions (e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has internal 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 check, and right border 3 despite potentially distant upper 6); row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a mid-row 3 at col 9 that skips zero but may violate no-extension-over-zero; row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] overlays 6s correctly but lacks expected 3 caps around isolated 6s if adjacent to implied zeros (unknown if input has zeros there); overall, test output mismatches expected by having asymmetric border 3s (e.g., left 3 but right 8 in some rows where upper 6 proximity should symmetrize) and possible over-extension of 3s inward past 6s (e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends left/right 3s but interacts oddly with central 6).
 * Subtle misses in this attempt: Left border min_k <=5 threshold may be too loose for test (causing extra 3s); right border dist <=4 may under-cap in wider segments; overlay uses lower row prematurely (before its processing, leading to missing 6s from bottom-up propagation); cap function skips if no upper 6 but test may need input-based fallback; no function for extracting/validating full segments across rows (would help debug propagation).
 * Function `overlay_sixes_from_adjacents` is helpful but potentially broken for bottom rows (accesses unprocessed lower out); `set_left_border` has redundant while loop (inefficient but correct); `set_right_border` uses break after first 6 but computes max_k incorrectly if multiple (only takes last in reverse scan); no unhelpful functions noted, but main program assumes uniform n without checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., visible patterns of 6s overlaying vertically, 3s capping some zero-adjacent segments, border 3s in non-top rows, inward extensions like double 3s on edges without zeros) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Specific issues: Row 4 ends with [...,8,6,8,8,3] where right 3 caps a segment adjacent to zero, but if upper row (row 3) has no 6 over that segment, it shouldn't cap (unknown input, but generated 3 seems over-applied); row 10 has [...,3,0,8,... ,3] with left/mid/right 3s, but the 0 breaks the segment, so mid 3 at col9 shouldn't exist if it's not an edge; row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0] overlays 6 correctly from adjacents but lacks any 3 caps on its short non-zero segment edges, which should get 3s if upper (row 11) has 6 nearby (row 11 is all 0s in generated, but propagation may be off); row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] shows internal 3 at col8 splitting a zero, but capping should only edge non-zero segments, not insert mid-zero; asymmetries like row 2 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] having two 6s without border impact, while row 16 has three 6s but no 3s, suggest inconsistent proximity/dist thresholds; expected output should have more uniform border 3s (e.g., full left/right 3s where upper 6s are central) and no 3s over/near 6s unless edge-capping; the output propagates some 7-replacements (implied in odd rows like row 1,3) but test grid seems to lack 7s, so focus on even-row rules failing subtly (e.g., unknown why row 6 extends to [3,3,...,3,3] but includes a 6 without capping around it).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like walls, paths, or patterns in a grid-based image) by applying row-specific rules: odd rows undergo pattern replacements, while even rows are initialized, overlaid, capped, and bordered according to adjacency and conditions involving 6s and 0s. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually matches an expected pattern, such as a stylized drawing or maze, by simulating rules that create borders (3s), paths (6s), fills (8s), and empties (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of [7,7,7] must be replaced with [8,6,8] to create "bridges" or paths; this is processed first and independently for all odd rows.
 * Even rows: Start with a base of 8 for non-zero input cells and 0 for zeros; then overlay 6s in positions where the upper or lower row (odd) has a 6 in the same column, simulating vertical continuity.
 * Segment capping in even rows: For non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left/right edges with 3 if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skip right cap on bottom row; this creates "guarded" edges but only for segments influenced by upper 6s.
 * Border handling in even rows: Left and right edges are set to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s (e.g., if a 6 is within ~5 positions on left or ~4 on right, use 3; otherwise 8), input values (prefer 3 if input is 3), and row position (top rows default to 8, bottom may force 3); this is separate from segment capping and focuses on the grid's outer borders.
 * Inward extension: In non-bottom even rows without zeros, extend border 3s inward by one position if followed by an 8, to "thicken" borders subtly.
 * Global considerations: Process odd rows fully before even rows; even rows are done top-to-bottom, relying on already-processed odd rows above; handle edge cases like single-row grids, zero-length rows, top/bottom status, and varying segment lengths; subtle misses include incorrect proximity distances (e.g., left uses <=5, right <=4), not skipping right caps only on bottom, or failing to check for upper 6s per segment/border.
 * Input assumptions: Grid has uniform width n, rows alternate even/odd starting at 0; numbers include 0 (empty), 3 (border), 6 (path), 7 (pre-replacement), 8 (fill); no overlapping replacements or backward passes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Borders check min/max k for 6 proximity differently on left/right; extensions only if no zeros and n>=2; overlays use already-processed adjacent rows, so order matters; caps and borders can interact (e.g., a border 3 might be overwritten or extended).

(The above functions are helpful for core transformations; others like set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_border_threes_inward are also useful but overly specific to proximity logic, which may need tuning; initialize_even_row_base is simple and correct but basic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row replacements, even-row basing, 6 overlays, and basic capping/bordering.
 * Worked well: Pattern replacement in odd rows is non-overlapping and forward-only, avoiding infinite loops; overlays correctly propagate 6s vertically using processed adjacent rows.
 * Did not work fully: Border proximity logic (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be arbitrary or incorrect for some cases, as it hardcodes distances that might not generalize; right border search starts from end but breaks on first 6, potentially missing closer ones if not reversed properly.
 * Capping skips right edges only on bottom, which is good, but may overcap if segments overlap with borders; extensions only apply if no zeros, which prevents artifacts but might miss partial fills.
 * Function set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are helpful but complex and potentially buggy in min/max k calculations (e.g., right_max_k init to -1, loop direction); they handle top/bottom and input_3 fallbacks correctly.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges correctly identifies segments and checks upper 6s per segment, but doesn't handle if upper row isn't processed yet (though main program orders it right).
 * Function extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and mostly correct but skips if any zero exists, which could prevent needed extensions in mixed rows.
 * Overall, the main program structure (odd first, then even top-to-bottom) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but earlier attempts (implied) might have missed order or proximity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a coherent 18-row grid (9 even, 9 odd) with consistent patterns: odd rows have isolated [8,6,8] amid 0s, even rows have fills of 8s interrupted by 6s and bordered by 3s, creating vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking across rows).
 * It looks mostly correct and sensible: Overlays propagate 6s properly (e.g., row 1's 6 at col 10 aligns with row 0's 6 there; row 3's [8,6,8] at cols 12-14 influences row 2 and 4); borders use 3s at edges where upper 6s are proximal (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at both ends extended inward).
 * Potential issues: Row 4 has a 3 at col 0, 8s, a 0 at col 7, then 3 at col 8, suggesting capping worked but the inner 3 might be from border logic overlapping a segment; row 10 has 3 at col 0, but a 0 at col 10 breaks continuity, and 3 at end—capping seems applied but extension skipped due to zero, which is correct per rules.
 * Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but no 3 caps visible around isolated 6s (since 6 overlays on base 8, not creating new segments adjacent to 0s); this matches rules as overlays don't trigger capping unless edges touch 0s with upper 6 condition.
 * Row 17 (odd) has scattered [8,6,8] and 0s, likely from input 7s replaced correctly; overall, the output visually forms connected paths/borders (e.g., vertical 6 channels at cols 7-8, 10-12), suggesting it makes sense for a puzzle like drawing outlines or mazes, but without expected output, can't confirm if border distances or specific 3 placements (e.g., row 11 all 0s, no influence) are exact—differences might be in unhandled input variations like non-7 patterns in odd rows.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:56:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid transformation puzzle where input grids of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) are processed row-by-row following rules that distinguish between odd and even rows (0-indexed), involving sequence replacements in odd rows, initialization and overlays in even rows, edge capping with 3s based on adjacency to 0s and upper-row 6s, border settings influenced by input values and proximity to upper 6s, and inward extensions of 3s under specific conditions. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually represents some puzzle solution, likely encoding shapes or patterns through these numerical transformations, with training examples validating the rules on smaller grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1,3,5...) are processed first and independently: non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8], but shorter rows or non-matching sequences are unchanged; this must skip overlaps correctly by advancing i+=3 only on match.
 * Even rows (0,2,4...) initialize to 8 for non-zero input positions and 0 for zeros, then overlay 6s in columns where the immediate upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6; this creates vertical alignments of 6s.
 * After overlay, even rows cap the left and right edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s, but only if the segment has any upper-row 6 in its range; right capping is skipped for bottom rows; this prevents "dangling" 8s next to 0s when 6s are involved above.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left border (col 0) sets to 8 for top row, or 3 if upper has nearby 6 (within segment or <=5 cols for bottom/non-bottom), else based on input 3; right border (col n-1) similar but uses distance from rightmost upper 6 (<=4 cols triggers 3); falls back to input-driven 3 or 8 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of border 3s: for non-bottom even rows without any 0s, if border is 3 followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one position; this subtly widens borders but skips if zeros present or row too short.
 * Overall processing order: odd rows first (bottom-up or top-down doesn't matter since independent), then even rows top-to-bottom (to ensure upper rows are processed for overlays/caps); copy input to output initially to preserve non-transformed parts.
 * Subtleties: "Proximity" for borders uses min/max k for left/right upper 6s within the border segment; bottom rows avoid right capping and use looser left proximity (<=5); input g is used for base init and border fallbacks, but out is mutated progressively; empty/short grids return unchanged; assumes all rows same length n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check both upper/lower but only after odds processed (lowers may be odds); capping skips if no upper 6 even if segment exists; borders consider full left/right segments for 6 search; no changes if position already 6/3; potential for multiple passes or interactions missed if order wrong.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve 0s strictly except via overlays (which can turn 8/0 to 6); 7s only appear in odds and are fully replaced; visual output likely forms connected "blobs" of 8/6 with 3 borders and 0 gaps, possibly representing puzzle objects like shapes or paths; test grids are larger (17 cols, 19 rows?), so scale matters for segment finding.

            i += 1
        end = i - 1
        segment_has_upper_6 = any(out[j - 1][k] == 6 for k in range(start, end + 1)) if has_upper else False
        if start > 0 and new_row[start - 1] == 0 and segment_has_upper_6:
            new_row[start] = 3
        if not is_bottom and end < n - 1 and new_row[end + 1] == 0 and segment_has_upper_6:
            new_row[end] = 3
    return new_row
```
(Note: The any() optimization in cap is helpful for efficiency in larger grids; original used a loop but same logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided, so no prior attempts to compare directly; however, the structure builds on implied earlier trials by modularizing into functions for odd processing, even base/overlay/cap/border/extend.
 * What worked: Odd row replacement correctly handles non-overlapping [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8], as validated by training examples passing; even row initialization preserves 0s and sets 8s; overlay propagates 6s vertically from adjacent rows accurately.
 * What didn't work: Border setting for left/right uses hardcoded distances (e.g., <=5 for left bottom, <=4 for right), which may be too rigid—training passed but could fail on varying segment lengths; inward extension skips if any 0 present, but might need per-border check; capping correctly identifies segments but assumes upper row processed (works top-to-bottom).
 * Subtle miss: In set_left_border and set_right_border, proximity searches start from segment ends but use global min_k/max_k; for right border, loop is backward (good), but dist calc is n-1 - right_max_k, which might undervalue long right segments in test.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges is helpful and core for edge 3s, but its segment_has_upper_6 check could be optimized; set_left_border and set_right_border are essential but overly complex—simplify proximity if possible.
 * extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and likely key for widening borders in solid rows, but untested in training (assumed correct since they passed).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant; earlier implied attempts might have lacked modularity, leading to monolithic main func errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row by 17-col grid with patterns of 8/6/3/0, including vertical 6 alignments (e.g., col 10 has 6s in rows 1,2,13,14), border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 10 has 3s at edges), and 0-filled even rows in places; it looks partially correct as it maintains 0 gaps and propagates 6s, but does not fully match expected visual coherence—e.g., row 4 has [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] with isolated 3 at col8 next to 0, which seems right for capping, but row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] lacks expected border 3s despite upper 6s nearby, suggesting border functions under-applied (possibly due to segment proximity thresholds like <=4/5 being too strict for this wider grid).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have more consistent 3 borders on even rows adjacent to 0s with upper 6s (e.g., row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a 0 in col10 breaking segment, but left segment caps to 3 correctly, right starts at col11 without left cap since not adjacent to 0—wait, col10=0 should cap col11 if upper 6, but output has 8 there, indicating cap function missed the post-0 segment); also, bottom rows (e.g., row 18) should avoid right 3s but output has them, mismatching is_bottom logic.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (6 overlays and odd replacements look good, forming blob-like structures with 0 voids), but borders/caps are inconsistent—e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends 3s inward correctly, but row 12 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has unexplained 3 at col9 without clear upper 6 adjacency; this suggests proximity rules need tuning for test's scale/spacing; it's different from a "correct" uniform bordering, likely due to hardcoded distances not generalizing.

[2025-10-01 14:56:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_triple_sevens(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replace non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""
    if len(row) < 3:
        return row[:]
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i:i+3] == [7, 7, 7]:
            new_row[i:i+3] = [8, 6, 8]
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def overlay_sixes_from_adjacents(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], row_index: int, num_rows: int, n: int, base_row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Overlay 6 in even row positions where upper or lower row has 6."""
    new_row = base_row[:]
    has_upper = row_index > 0
    has_lower = row_index < num_rows - 1
    for col in range(n):
        overlay = False
        if has_upper and out[row_index - 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if has_lower and out[row_index + 1][col] == 6:
            overlay = True
        if overlay:
            new_row[col] = 6
    return new_row
```

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid transformation puzzle where input grids of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) are processed row-by-row following rules that distinguish between odd and even rows (0-indexed), involving sequence replacements in odd rows, initialization and overlays in even rows, edge capping with 3s based on adjacency to 0s and upper-row 6s, border settings influenced by input values and proximity to upper 6s, and inward extensions of 3s under specific conditions. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually represents some puzzle solution, likely encoding shapes or patterns through these numerical transformations, with training examples validating the rules on smaller grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1,3,5...) are processed first and independently: non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8], but shorter rows or non-matching sequences are unchanged; this must skip overlaps correctly by advancing i+=3 only on match.
 * Even rows (0,2,4...) initialize to 8 for non-zero input positions and 0 for zeros, then overlay 6s in columns where the immediate upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6; this creates vertical alignments of 6s.
 * After overlay, even rows cap the left and right edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s, but only if the segment has any upper-row 6 in its range; right capping is skipped for bottom rows; this prevents "dangling" 8s next to 0s when 6s are involved above.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left border (col 0) sets to 8 for top row, or 3 if upper has nearby 6 (within segment or <=5 cols for bottom/non-bottom), else based on input 3; right border (col n-1) similar but uses distance from rightmost upper 6 (<=4 cols triggers 3); falls back to input-driven 3 or 8 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of border 3s: for non-bottom even rows without any 0s, if border is 3 followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one position; this subtly widens borders but skips if zeros present or row too short.
 * Overall processing order: odd rows first (bottom-up or top-down doesn't matter since independent), then even rows top-to-bottom (to ensure upper rows are processed for overlays/caps); copy input to output initially to preserve non-transformed parts.
 * Subtleties: "Proximity" for borders uses min/max k for left/right upper 6s within the border segment; bottom rows avoid right capping and use looser left proximity (<=5); input g is used for base init and border fallbacks, but out is mutated progressively; empty/short grids return unchanged; assumes all rows same length n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check both upper/lower but only after odds processed (lowers may be odds); capping skips if no upper 6 even if segment exists; borders consider full left/right segments for 6 search; no changes if position already 6/3; potential for multiple passes or interactions missed if order wrong.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve 0s strictly except via overlays (which can turn 8/0 to 6); 7s only appear in odds and are fully replaced; visual output likely forms connected "blobs" of 8/6 with 3 borders and 0 gaps, possibly representing puzzle objects like shapes or paths; test grids are larger (17 cols, 19 rows?), so scale matters for segment finding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided, so no prior attempts to compare directly; however, the structure builds on implied earlier trials by modularizing into functions for odd processing, even base/overlay/cap/border/extend.
 * What worked: Odd row replacement correctly handles non-overlapping [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8], as validated by training examples passing; even row initialization preserves 0s and sets 8s; overlay propagates 6s vertically from adjacent rows accurately.
 * What didn't work: Border setting for left/right uses hardcoded distances (e.g., <=5 for left bottom, <=4 for right), which may be too rigid—training passed but could fail on varying segment lengths; inward extension skips if any 0 present, but might need per-border check; capping correctly identifies segments but assumes upper row processed (works top-to-bottom).
 * Subtle miss: In set_left_border and set_right_border, proximity searches start from segment ends but use global min_k/max_k; for right border, loop is backward (good), but dist calc is n-1 - right_max_k, which might undervalue long right segments in test.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges is helpful and core for edge 3s, but its segment_has_upper_6 check could be optimized; set_left_border and set_right_border are essential but overly complex—simplify proximity if possible.
 * extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and likely key for widening borders in solid rows, but untested in training (assumed correct since they passed).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant; earlier implied attempts might have lacked modularity, leading to monolithic main func errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row by 17-col grid with patterns of 8/6/3/0, including vertical 6 alignments (e.g., col 10 has 6s in rows 1,2,13,14), border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 10 has 3s at edges), and 0-filled even rows in places; it looks partially correct as it maintains 0 gaps and propagates 6s, but does not fully match expected visual coherence—e.g., row 4 has [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] with isolated 3 at col8 next to 0, which seems right for capping, but row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] lacks expected border 3s despite upper 6s nearby, suggesting border functions under-applied (possibly due to segment proximity thresholds like <=4/5 being too strict for this wider grid).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have more consistent 3 borders on even rows adjacent to 0s with upper 6s (e.g., row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a 0 in col10 breaking segment, but left segment caps to 3 correctly, right starts at col11 without left cap since not adjacent to 0—wait, col10=0 should cap col11 if upper 6, but output has 8 there, indicating cap function missed the post-0 segment); also, bottom rows (e.g., row 18) should avoid right 3s but output has them, mismatching is_bottom logic.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (6 overlays and odd replacements look good, forming blob-like structures with 0 voids), but borders/caps are inconsistent—e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends 3s inward correctly, but row 12 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has unexplained 3 at col9 without clear upper 6 adjacency; this suggests proximity rules need tuning for test's scale/spacing; it's different from a "correct" uniform bordering, likely due to hardcoded distances not generalizing.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

from typing import List

def process_odd_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Replaces non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8] in odd rows."""

    """Caps left and right edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3 if segment has upper 6."""
    # (as provided; key for internal edge handling, but skips bottom right correctly)
```

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace sequences of [7,7,7] with [8,6,8] non-overlappingly, while even rows start with an 8/0 base (8 for non-zero input, 0 for zero), overlay 6s based on adjacent rows' 6s, cap edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s if the segment has an upper 6, handle borders specially (setting to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s, input values, and top/bottom status), and optionally extend border 3s inward if followed/preceded by 8s in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8]; shorter rows or non-matching sequences pass through unchanged; no other modifications to odd rows.
 * Even rows use the original input for base initialization and border checks but build on top of processed odd rows for overlays and caps; base is strictly 8 for any non-zero input cell, 0 for zero, ignoring processed values.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the exact same column in upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6; this can propagate vertically but only affects even rows.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments in even rows that are adjacent to 0s (left or right), and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row above any part of it; right cap is skipped in bottom row; this creates "capped" borders on islands of non-zeros.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex and position-specific: left/right edges of the entire row (if non-zero) are set to 3 or 8 based on whether there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left non-zero segment; right: closest upper 6 from the right, with distance thresholds like <=5 for left or <=4 for right to decide 3 vs 8); top row always gets 8 on borders; bottom row influences left/right to prefer 3 if upper 6 present; falls back to input 3 for 3 or 8 otherwise.
 * Extension of border 3s inward happens only in non-bottom even rows that have no zeros at all and length >=2: if border is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 one position inward (both sides independently).
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> borders -> extend); this ensures upper odd rows influence lower even rows correctly, but lower odd rows don't retroactively affect upper even rows.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: non-overlapping replacement in odd rows skips after replacement (i +=3); segment detection in caps scans contiguous non-zeros; border proximity uses min_k for left (any in left segment) but max_k/dist for right (closest from right end); input_row used only for base and border fallbacks, not for overlays/caps; zeros in even rows stay zero unless overlaid/capped/bordered; no diagonal or horizontal propagation beyond specified.
 * Edge cases: empty/short grids return unchanged; single-row (even or odd) handled appropriately; bottom row skips right caps and some extensions; full-8 rows without zeros enable extensions; multiple segments per row handled independently for caps but borders look at whole-row edges.
 * All considerations: vertical adjacency for 6 overlays (upper/lower); horizontal contiguity for segments/caps; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., left min_k <=5, right dist <=4); top/bottom special casing; no changes to odd rows after initial process; even rows can introduce 3s/6s where input was non-zero/zero but rules apply.

(Note: Other functions like initialize_even_base, handle_borders, extend_border_threes, and the main program orchestrator are also helpful for base setup, complex border logic, and final extensions, as they passed training; no object extraction functions are needed or present, as this is rule-based transformation without higher-level "objects" like blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like odd-row [7,7,7] replacement, even-row 8/0 base, vertical 6 overlays, segment-based 3 capping conditional on upper 6s, and basic border 3/8 decisions.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is precise and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically as expected; capping isolates segments correctly and respects bottom-row no-right-cap; extensions only apply to full non-zero non-bottom rows.
 * What didn't work: Border handling in handle_borders may have subtle flaws in proximity calculations (e.g., left uses any upper 6 in segment but thresholds like <=5; right uses closest from end with <=4 dist), potentially misapplying 3 vs 8 in test cases with distant upper 6s; extension skips rows with any zero, which might miss partial extensions; no handling for input values other than 0/3/7/8/6 assumed, could fail on unknowns.
 * The program processes even rows top-to-bottom, which works for training but might not account for lower odd rows influencing upper even overlays if order changed (but current order matches needs).
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one shows partial understanding: core transformations pass training, but test output suggests possible over-application of 3s or missed extensions in complex layouts.
 * Function handle_borders is helpful but overly complex and potentially buggy in right-border distance (searches from right but breaks on first 6, using dist = n-1 - right_max_k); could be refined for accuracy.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though cap_adjacent_zeros skips if no upper 6 even if segment needs capping otherwise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 18-row by 17-column grid with patterns of 8s forming backgrounds/islands, 6s in vertical alignments (e.g., columns 10-11 have recurring 6s across rows), 3s capping edges of segments (e.g., row 4 [bottom]: 3 at ends of main island; row 10: 3s at positions 1,9,16), and 0s as gaps/spacers; odd rows have 8/6 patterns from 7 replacements, even rows show overlays and caps.
 * The test output makes sense overall as it follows the rules: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 from likely [7,7,7]; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row1/3; row 4 (even) has 3 caps at ends where adjacent to 0s and upper row3 has 6s; borders often 8 or 3 based on proximity (e.g., row 4 right 3 near upper 6 at col13).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even) has a 0 at col10 but surrounding 8s/3s suggest possible missed overlay from lower row11 (all 0s, so no); row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but input/base might not justify if no adjacent 6s; row 18 (even, bottom?) shows 3 caps but if bottom, right cap should be skipped yet has 3 at end—wait, grid has 18 rows, if 0-indexed row17 is bottom, but listing suggests possible miscount; extensions seem missing in some full-8 rows like row 8 (has 6s, no extend); differences from expected: more 3s on left borders than anticipated (e.g., row 4 starts with 3, but if no close upper 6, should be 8); unknown why row 10 has isolated 0 at col10 amid 8s—possibly uncapped zero not adjacent to upper 6.
 * The test output is mostly consistent with rules but likely incorrect in border decisions (overuse of 3s where dist > threshold) and possible missed lower influences on overlays (since even processed top-down, lower odd rows like row13 affect row12 overlay? Wait, code uses out[j+1] which is original until processed, but odd processed first so yes); to handle test, update border thresholds or search logic for right side.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8], while even rows start with a base of 8s (or 0s where input is 0), overlay 6s from adjacent rows, cap non-zero segment edges adjacent to 0s with 3s under conditions involving upper-row 6s, handle left/right borders specially based on proximity to upper 6s and input values, and extend border 3s inward in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only replace exact non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8,6,8]; do not touch other values or overlapping patterns.
 * Even rows use the original input grid (g) for base initialization and border decisions, but overlays and caps use the updated output grid (out) for adjacency checks to propagate changes from previously processed rows.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the upper or lower row (in out) has a 6 in the same column; this can create new 6s that affect later capping or bordering.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row (for non-top rows); skip right-edge capping on bottom rows; this prevents over-capping in isolated segments without upper influence.
 * Border handling (left/right) is complex: for non-top rows, set to 3 if there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left segment length, ideally min distance <=5; right: max distance <=4 from edge), or fall back to input value (3 if input is 3, else 8); top rows always get 8 on borders; bottom rows prioritize 3 if upper 6 condition met.
 * Extend border 3s inward by one position only if the next cell is 8, the row has no 0s, it's not the bottom row, and n >=2; this creates "thick" borders without zeros.
 * Process odd rows before even rows, and even rows top-to-bottom to ensure propagation; input g is preserved for base/border logic, but out is updated in place.
 * Subtle edge cases: zero segments skip all processing; top row has no upper, so no 6-based capping/bordering (defaults to 8s); bottom row skips right capping and some extensions; proximity calculations for borders use min/max distances to nearest upper 6 within the border segment; overlapping rules (e.g., overlay then cap) must be applied in sequence without revisiting.
 * All rows assume uniform width n; empty or single-row grids return unchanged; no diagonal or multi-row pattern matching beyond vertical adjacency for 6s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (full match on all rules like triple-7 replacement, 6 overlays, 3 capping, border setting, and inward extension).
 * What worked: Odd-row processing is solid (non-overlapping 7->868); even-row base init preserves input zeros correctly; 6 overlay propagates vertically as expected; capping applies 3s only to qualifying segment edges (e.g., adjacent to 0 with upper 6); borders use input fallbacks and distance-based 6 proximity accurately for training cases.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, several even rows show unexpected 3s or 8s on borders/internal positions (e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has internal 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 check, and right border 3 despite potentially distant upper 6); row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a mid-row 3 at col 9 that skips zero but may violate no-extension-over-zero; row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] overlays 6s correctly but lacks expected 3 caps around isolated 6s if adjacent to implied zeros (unknown if input has zeros there); overall, test output mismatches expected by having asymmetric border 3s (e.g., left 3 but right 8 in some rows where upper 6 proximity should symmetrize) and possible over-extension of 3s inward past 6s (e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends left/right 3s but interacts oddly with central 6).
 * Subtle misses in this attempt: Left border min_k <=5 threshold may be too loose for test (causing extra 3s); right border dist <=4 may under-cap in wider segments; overlay uses lower row prematurely (before its processing, leading to missing 6s from bottom-up propagation); cap function skips if no upper 6 but test may need input-based fallback; no function for extracting/validating full segments across rows (would help debug propagation).
 * Function `overlay_sixes_from_adjacents` is helpful but potentially broken for bottom rows (accesses unprocessed lower out); `set_left_border` has redundant while loop (inefficient but correct); `set_right_border` uses break after first 6 but computes max_k incorrectly if multiple (only takes last in reverse scan); no unhelpful functions noted, but main program assumes uniform n without checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., visible patterns of 6s overlaying vertically, 3s capping some zero-adjacent segments, border 3s in non-top rows, inward extensions like double 3s on edges without zeros) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Specific issues: Row 4 ends with [...,8,6,8,8,3] where right 3 caps a segment adjacent to zero, but if upper row (row 3) has no 6 over that segment, it shouldn't cap (unknown input, but generated 3 seems over-applied); row 10 has [...,3,0,8,... ,3] with left/mid/right 3s, but the 0 breaks the segment, so mid 3 at col9 shouldn't exist if it's not an edge; row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0] overlays 6 correctly from adjacents but lacks any 3 caps on its short non-zero segment edges, which should get 3s if upper (row 11) has 6 nearby (row 11 is all 0s in generated, but propagation may be off); row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] shows internal 3 at col8 splitting a zero, but capping should only edge non-zero segments, not insert mid-zero; asymmetries like row 2 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] having two 6s without border impact, while row 16 has three 6s but no 3s, suggest inconsistent proximity/dist thresholds; expected output should have more uniform border 3s (e.g., full left/right 3s where upper 6s are central) and no 3s over/near 6s unless edge-capping; the output propagates some 7-replacements (implied in odd rows like row 1,3) but test grid seems to lack 7s, so focus on even-row rules failing subtly (e.g., unknown why row 6 extends to [3,3,...,3,3] but includes a 6 without capping around it).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like walls, paths, or patterns in a grid-based image) by applying row-specific rules: odd rows undergo pattern replacements, while even rows are initialized, overlaid, capped, and bordered according to adjacency and conditions involving 6s and 0s. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually matches an expected pattern, such as a stylized drawing or maze, by simulating rules that create borders (3s), paths (6s), fills (8s), and empties (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of [7,7,7] must be replaced with [8,6,8] to create "bridges" or paths; this is processed first and independently for all odd rows.
 * Even rows: Start with a base of 8 for non-zero input cells and 0 for zeros; then overlay 6s in positions where the upper or lower row (odd) has a 6 in the same column, simulating vertical continuity.
 * Segment capping in even rows: For non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left/right edges with 3 if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skip right cap on bottom row; this creates "guarded" edges but only for segments influenced by upper 6s.
 * Border handling in even rows: Left and right edges are set to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s (e.g., if a 6 is within ~5 positions on left or ~4 on right, use 3; otherwise 8), input values (prefer 3 if input is 3), and row position (top rows default to 8, bottom may force 3); this is separate from segment capping and focuses on the grid's outer borders.
 * Inward extension: In non-bottom even rows without zeros, extend border 3s inward by one position if followed by an 8, to "thicken" borders subtly.
 * Global considerations: Process odd rows fully before even rows; even rows are done top-to-bottom, relying on already-processed odd rows above; handle edge cases like single-row grids, zero-length rows, top/bottom status, and varying segment lengths; subtle misses include incorrect proximity distances (e.g., left uses <=5, right <=4), not skipping right caps only on bottom, or failing to check for upper 6s per segment/border.
 * Input assumptions: Grid has uniform width n, rows alternate even/odd starting at 0; numbers include 0 (empty), 3 (border), 6 (path), 7 (pre-replacement), 8 (fill); no overlapping replacements or backward passes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Borders check min/max k for 6 proximity differently on left/right; extensions only if no zeros and n>=2; overlays use already-processed adjacent rows, so order matters; caps and borders can interact (e.g., a border 3 might be overwritten or extended).

(The above functions are helpful for core transformations; others like set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_border_threes_inward are also useful but overly specific to proximity logic, which may need tuning; initialize_even_row_base is simple and correct but basic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row replacements, even-row basing, 6 overlays, and basic capping/bordering.
 * Worked well: Pattern replacement in odd rows is non-overlapping and forward-only, avoiding infinite loops; overlays correctly propagate 6s vertically using processed adjacent rows.
 * Did not work fully: Border proximity logic (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be arbitrary or incorrect for some cases, as it hardcodes distances that might not generalize; right border search starts from end but breaks on first 6, potentially missing closer ones if not reversed properly.
 * Capping skips right edges only on bottom, which is good, but may overcap if segments overlap with borders; extensions only apply if no zeros, which prevents artifacts but might miss partial fills.
 * Function set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are helpful but complex and potentially buggy in min/max k calculations (e.g., right_max_k init to -1, loop direction); they handle top/bottom and input_3 fallbacks correctly.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges correctly identifies segments and checks upper 6s per segment, but doesn't handle if upper row isn't processed yet (though main program orders it right).
 * Function extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and mostly correct but skips if any zero exists, which could prevent needed extensions in mixed rows.
 * Overall, the main program structure (odd first, then even top-to-bottom) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but earlier attempts (implied) might have missed order or proximity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a coherent 18-row grid (9 even, 9 odd) with consistent patterns: odd rows have isolated [8,6,8] amid 0s, even rows have fills of 8s interrupted by 6s and bordered by 3s, creating vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking across rows).
 * It looks mostly correct and sensible: Overlays propagate 6s properly (e.g., row 1's 6 at col 10 aligns with row 0's 6 there; row 3's [8,6,8] at cols 12-14 influences row 2 and 4); borders use 3s at edges where upper 6s are proximal (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at both ends extended inward).
 * Potential issues: Row 4 has a 3 at col 0, 8s, a 0 at col 7, then 3 at col 8, suggesting capping worked but the inner 3 might be from border logic overlapping a segment; row 10 has 3 at col 0, but a 0 at col 10 breaks continuity, and 3 at end—capping seems applied but extension skipped due to zero, which is correct per rules.
 * Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but no 3 caps visible around isolated 6s (since 6 overlays on base 8, not creating new segments adjacent to 0s); this matches rules as overlays don't trigger capping unless edges touch 0s with upper 6 condition.
 * Row 17 (odd) has scattered [8,6,8] and 0s, likely from input 7s replaced correctly; overall, the output visually forms connected paths/borders (e.g., vertical 6 channels at cols 7-8, 10-12), suggesting it makes sense for a puzzle like drawing outlines or mazes, but without expected output, can't confirm if border distances or specific 3 placements (e.g., row 11 all 0s, no influence) are exact—differences might be in unhandled input variations like non-7 patterns in odd rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 15:00:36] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing a drawing or shape with symbols like 8 for lines, 6 for holes or overlays, 3 for edge caps, 7 for replaceable patterns, and 0 for empty space) that must be transformed according to layered rules: replacing specific sequences on odd rows, initializing and overlaying values on even rows based on adjacency, and applying border/edge modifications to create coherent shapes. The goal is to produce a modified grid that visually renders or completes the puzzle elements correctly, ensuring consistency across rows and handling interactions between adjacent rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triple 7s ([7,7,7]) appear only on odd-indexed rows (1-based or 0-based even/odd alternation) and must be replaced exactly with [8,6,8], skipping forward by 3 positions to avoid overlapping replacements; this is a preprocessing step before even-row modifications.
 * Even-indexed rows (starting from row 0) are initialized to 8 where the original grid has non-zero values (preserving 0s as empty), then overlaid with 6s in columns where the row above or below has a 6, simulating vertical propagation of "holes" or special markers.
 * Segment capping on even rows: Non-zero segments (runs of 8s or 6s) get their left/right edges set to 3 if adjacent to 0 and the upper row has a 6 in that segment; this only applies if not the bottom row for right edges, and it's skipped for top row borders.
 * Border handling is asymmetric and position-dependent: Left border of even rows sets to 3 if the connected segment has an upper 6 nearby (within the segment or close, with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or based on original; right border uses max_k distance <=4 for 3, else 8; top row borders are always 8.
 * Extend border 3s only on non-bottom even rows: If a border 3 is followed by an 8 (inward), extend the 3 one position inward to "thicken" or connect edges.
 * Subtleties include: No modifications to odd rows beyond initial 7-replacement; upper row for row 0 is treated as all 0s; segments are contiguous non-0 runs; left/right border logic checks the entire connected non-0 prefix/suffix for 6s in upper row, with distance thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist<=4) that seem tuned for specific shape widths (n=17 in test); is_bottom flag prevents certain extensions/caps; original g[j] used as fallback for borders if no upper 6.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays happen before capping/borders, so 6s can influence edge decisions; replacements only on odd rows, but overlays reference the modified out grid (including replaced odd rows); no handling for vertical 7s or other patterns; assumes uniform n across rows; 0s block segment extension but not overlay checks.
 * Across attempts (inferred from code evolution): Early versions might have missed adjacency for overlays or used wrong thresholds for borders (e.g., fixed dist=5 vs variable); need to copy rows to avoid mutating originals; handle empty/short rows gracefully.

```

(Note: Other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_base are also helpful for border logic but more specialized; the main program orchestrates them correctly for even rows after odd-row preprocessing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core rules for 7-replacement, even-row initialization/overlays, and basic segment capping/borders are correctly implemented for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Non-overlapping triple-7 replacement on odd rows preserves structure and introduces 6s correctly; overlay_sixes propagates 6s vertically using the updated out grid; cap_segment_edges identifies segments accurately and applies 3s only when upper 6 present and edges touch 0; border functions handle top-row simplicity (always 8) and fallbacks to original g_row.
 * What didn't work: In more complex test cases, border thresholds (left_min_k <=5, right_dist <=4) may be too rigid, potentially over- or under-applying 3s in wider shapes (e.g., if 6 is far from border, it might not cap when it should); extend_border_threes only extends inward by 1 if 3-8 adjacent, but might miss longer chains or bottom-row cases; no extraction of "objects" like full shapes, so holistic shape validation is absent—future attempts could add a function to detect connected components of 8/6/3 for debugging.
 * Earlier attempts (inferred): Likely missed odd-row preprocessing, leading to unchanged 7s in outputs; incorrect overlay ignoring lower rows; symmetric left/right borders causing mismatched 3 placements; unhelpful functions like naive full-grid replacements (e.g., replacing all 7s without triples) broke patterns—avoid them as they ignore row parity and sequencing.
 * Function `set_left_border` and `set_right_border` are helpful but subtle—broken if thresholds are wrong (e.g., always <=5 might cap too much in test); `extend_border_threes` is marginally helpful but limited to n>=2 and non-bottom, may not extend far enough for jagged edges.
 * Training 1 likely had simple horizontal shapes where overlays and caps aligned perfectly; Training 2 added vertical interactions, which passed, but test introduces multiple disjoint segments and wider n=17, exposing border distance issues.
 * No object extraction in this attempt, but adding one (e.g., find_segments returning list of (start,end,row) for non-0 runs) could help validate full shapes across rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, n=17) shows alternating even rows with mostly 8s, scattered 6s (e.g., positions 10,14 in row 0; 7,12 in row 2), 3s at borders/edges (e.g., row 4: 3 at 0,8,16; row 6: 3s at 0,1,15,16), and odd rows with sparse 8-6-8 or 0s (e.g., row 1: 8-6-8 at 9-11; row 3: 8-6-8 at 12-14), ending with more complex patterns in lower rows like row 16 with 6s at 3,6,12.
 * It makes partial sense: 6s propagate vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in rows 0,1,2,13,14), 3s cap segments near 6s (e.g., row 4 segment from 0-7 capped at 0, but 8 is 0 so isolated), and borders extend 3s (e.g., row 6 starts/ends with 3,3). This aligns with rules for shape rendering, like drawing bordered blobs with holes.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: In row 4, position 7 is 0 inside a potential segment (3,8s,0,3,...), which might be an overlay miss or uncapped gap—expected continuous 8/6 with 3 only at true edges; row 10 has 3 at 9 but 0 at 10, suggesting broken segment handling (perhaps left_border over-applied 3 without checking full connection); row 12 has 3,3 at start/end but no inner 3 extension where 8 follows, violating extend rule; lower rows (16-18) have denser 6s (e.g., row 16: 6 at 3,6,12; row 18: 6 at 3,12) but mismatched odd row 17 sparsity, possibly missing lower-row overlay influence or 7-replacement in upper odds. Differences from expected (mentally simulating rules on inferred input): More 0s in odd rows than expected (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 at 6-8, but if input had 7s elsewhere, they weren't replaced); border 3s in row 6 extend to two positions (3,3), good, but row 14 lacks similar for right side despite 6 at 7-8; overall, shapes look fragmented—expected smoother blobs (e.g., full-width 8s with internal 6 holes), but here disjoint (e.g., row 0 ends with 6 at 10, then 8s). Unknown why row 18 has 0 at 6-11 despite upper 6s, possibly base init ignored original non-0s.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:00:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid transformation puzzle where input grids of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) are processed row-by-row following rules that distinguish between odd and even rows (0-indexed), involving sequence replacements in odd rows, initialization and overlays in even rows, edge capping with 3s based on adjacency to 0s and upper-row 6s, border settings influenced by input values and proximity to upper 6s, and inward extensions of 3s under specific conditions. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually represents some puzzle solution, likely encoding shapes or patterns through these numerical transformations, with training examples validating the rules on smaller grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1,3,5...) are processed first and independently: non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8], but shorter rows or non-matching sequences are unchanged; this must skip overlaps correctly by advancing i+=3 only on match.
 * Even rows (0,2,4...) initialize to 8 for non-zero input positions and 0 for zeros, then overlay 6s in columns where the immediate upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6; this creates vertical alignments of 6s.
 * After overlay, even rows cap the left and right edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s, but only if the segment has any upper-row 6 in its range; right capping is skipped for bottom rows; this prevents "dangling" 8s next to 0s when 6s are involved above.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left border (col 0) sets to 8 for top row, or 3 if upper has nearby 6 (within segment or <=5 cols for bottom/non-bottom), else based on input 3; right border (col n-1) similar but uses distance from rightmost upper 6 (<=4 cols triggers 3); falls back to input-driven 3 or 8 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of border 3s: for non-bottom even rows without any 0s, if border is 3 followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one position; this subtly widens borders but skips if zeros present or row too short.
 * Overall processing order: odd rows first (bottom-up or top-down doesn't matter since independent), then even rows top-to-bottom (to ensure upper rows are processed for overlays/caps); copy input to output initially to preserve non-transformed parts.
 * Subtleties: "Proximity" for borders uses min/max k for left/right upper 6s within the border segment; bottom rows avoid right capping and use looser left proximity (<=5); input g is used for base init and border fallbacks, but out is mutated progressively; empty/short grids return unchanged; assumes all rows same length n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check both upper/lower but only after odds processed (lowers may be odds); capping skips if no upper 6 even if segment exists; borders consider full left/right segments for 6 search; no changes if position already 6/3; potential for multiple passes or interactions missed if order wrong.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve 0s strictly except via overlays (which can turn 8/0 to 6); 7s only appear in odds and are fully replaced; visual output likely forms connected "blobs" of 8/6 with 3 borders and 0 gaps, possibly representing puzzle objects like shapes or paths; test grids are larger (17 cols, 19 rows?), so scale matters for segment finding.

(Note: The any() optimization in cap is helpful for efficiency in larger grids; original used a loop but same logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided, so no prior attempts to compare directly; however, the structure builds on implied earlier trials by modularizing into functions for odd processing, even base/overlay/cap/border/extend.
 * What worked: Odd row replacement correctly handles non-overlapping [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8], as validated by training examples passing; even row initialization preserves 0s and sets 8s; overlay propagates 6s vertically from adjacent rows accurately.
 * What didn't work: Border setting for left/right uses hardcoded distances (e.g., <=5 for left bottom, <=4 for right), which may be too rigid—training passed but could fail on varying segment lengths; inward extension skips if any 0 present, but might need per-border check; capping correctly identifies segments but assumes upper row processed (works top-to-bottom).
 * Subtle miss: In set_left_border and set_right_border, proximity searches start from segment ends but use global min_k/max_k; for right border, loop is backward (good), but dist calc is n-1 - right_max_k, which might undervalue long right segments in test.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges is helpful and core for edge 3s, but its segment_has_upper_6 check could be optimized; set_left_border and set_right_border are essential but overly complex—simplify proximity if possible.
 * extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and likely key for widening borders in solid rows, but untested in training (assumed correct since they passed).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant; earlier implied attempts might have lacked modularity, leading to monolithic main func errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row by 17-col grid with patterns of 8/6/3/0, including vertical 6 alignments (e.g., col 10 has 6s in rows 1,2,13,14), border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 10 has 3s at edges), and 0-filled even rows in places; it looks partially correct as it maintains 0 gaps and propagates 6s, but does not fully match expected visual coherence—e.g., row 4 has [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] with isolated 3 at col8 next to 0, which seems right for capping, but row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] lacks expected border 3s despite upper 6s nearby, suggesting border functions under-applied (possibly due to segment proximity thresholds like <=4/5 being too strict for this wider grid).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have more consistent 3 borders on even rows adjacent to 0s with upper 6s (e.g., row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a 0 in col10 breaking segment, but left segment caps to 3 correctly, right starts at col11 without left cap since not adjacent to 0—wait, col10=0 should cap col11 if upper 6, but output has 8 there, indicating cap function missed the post-0 segment); also, bottom rows (e.g., row 18) should avoid right 3s but output has them, mismatching is_bottom logic.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (6 overlays and odd replacements look good, forming blob-like structures with 0 voids), but borders/caps are inconsistent—e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends 3s inward correctly, but row 12 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has unexplained 3 at col9 without clear upper 6 adjacency; this suggests proximity rules need tuning for test's scale/spacing; it's different from a "correct" uniform bordering, likely due to hardcoded distances not generalizing.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

    # (as provided; key for internal edge handling, but skips bottom right correctly)
```

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace sequences of [7,7,7] with [8,6,8] non-overlappingly, while even rows start with an 8/0 base (8 for non-zero input, 0 for zero), overlay 6s based on adjacent rows' 6s, cap edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s if the segment has an upper 6, handle borders specially (setting to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s, input values, and top/bottom status), and optionally extend border 3s inward if followed/preceded by 8s in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8]; shorter rows or non-matching sequences pass through unchanged; no other modifications to odd rows.
 * Even rows use the original input for base initialization and border checks but build on top of processed odd rows for overlays and caps; base is strictly 8 for any non-zero input cell, 0 for zero, ignoring processed values.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the exact same column in upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6; this can propagate vertically but only affects even rows.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments in even rows that are adjacent to 0s (left or right), and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row above any part of it; right cap is skipped in bottom row; this creates "capped" borders on islands of non-zeros.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex and position-specific: left/right edges of the entire row (if non-zero) are set to 3 or 8 based on whether there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left non-zero segment; right: closest upper 6 from the right, with distance thresholds like <=5 for left or <=4 for right to decide 3 vs 8); top row always gets 8 on borders; bottom row influences left/right to prefer 3 if upper 6 present; falls back to input 3 for 3 or 8 otherwise.
 * Extension of border 3s inward happens only in non-bottom even rows that have no zeros at all and length >=2: if border is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 one position inward (both sides independently).
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> borders -> extend); this ensures upper odd rows influence lower even rows correctly, but lower odd rows don't retroactively affect upper even rows.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: non-overlapping replacement in odd rows skips after replacement (i +=3); segment detection in caps scans contiguous non-zeros; border proximity uses min_k for left (any in left segment) but max_k/dist for right (closest from right end); input_row used only for base and border fallbacks, not for overlays/caps; zeros in even rows stay zero unless overlaid/capped/bordered; no diagonal or horizontal propagation beyond specified.
 * Edge cases: empty/short grids return unchanged; single-row (even or odd) handled appropriately; bottom row skips right caps and some extensions; full-8 rows without zeros enable extensions; multiple segments per row handled independently for caps but borders look at whole-row edges.
 * All considerations: vertical adjacency for 6 overlays (upper/lower); horizontal contiguity for segments/caps; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., left min_k <=5, right dist <=4); top/bottom special casing; no changes to odd rows after initial process; even rows can introduce 3s/6s where input was non-zero/zero but rules apply.

(Note: Other functions like initialize_even_base, handle_borders, extend_border_threes, and the main program orchestrator are also helpful for base setup, complex border logic, and final extensions, as they passed training; no object extraction functions are needed or present, as this is rule-based transformation without higher-level "objects" like blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like odd-row [7,7,7] replacement, even-row 8/0 base, vertical 6 overlays, segment-based 3 capping conditional on upper 6s, and basic border 3/8 decisions.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is precise and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically as expected; capping isolates segments correctly and respects bottom-row no-right-cap; extensions only apply to full non-zero non-bottom rows.
 * What didn't work: Border handling in handle_borders may have subtle flaws in proximity calculations (e.g., left uses any upper 6 in segment but thresholds like <=5; right uses closest from end with <=4 dist), potentially misapplying 3 vs 8 in test cases with distant upper 6s; extension skips rows with any zero, which might miss partial extensions; no handling for input values other than 0/3/7/8/6 assumed, could fail on unknowns.
 * The program processes even rows top-to-bottom, which works for training but might not account for lower odd rows influencing upper even overlays if order changed (but current order matches needs).
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one shows partial understanding: core transformations pass training, but test output suggests possible over-application of 3s or missed extensions in complex layouts.
 * Function handle_borders is helpful but overly complex and potentially buggy in right-border distance (searches from right but breaks on first 6, using dist = n-1 - right_max_k); could be refined for accuracy.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though cap_adjacent_zeros skips if no upper 6 even if segment needs capping otherwise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 18-row by 17-column grid with patterns of 8s forming backgrounds/islands, 6s in vertical alignments (e.g., columns 10-11 have recurring 6s across rows), 3s capping edges of segments (e.g., row 4 [bottom]: 3 at ends of main island; row 10: 3s at positions 1,9,16), and 0s as gaps/spacers; odd rows have 8/6 patterns from 7 replacements, even rows show overlays and caps.
 * The test output makes sense overall as it follows the rules: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 from likely [7,7,7]; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row1/3; row 4 (even) has 3 caps at ends where adjacent to 0s and upper row3 has 6s; borders often 8 or 3 based on proximity (e.g., row 4 right 3 near upper 6 at col13).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even) has a 0 at col10 but surrounding 8s/3s suggest possible missed overlay from lower row11 (all 0s, so no); row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but input/base might not justify if no adjacent 6s; row 18 (even, bottom?) shows 3 caps but if bottom, right cap should be skipped yet has 3 at end—wait, grid has 18 rows, if 0-indexed row17 is bottom, but listing suggests possible miscount; extensions seem missing in some full-8 rows like row 8 (has 6s, no extend); differences from expected: more 3s on left borders than anticipated (e.g., row 4 starts with 3, but if no close upper 6, should be 8); unknown why row 10 has isolated 0 at col10 amid 8s—possibly uncapped zero not adjacent to upper 6.
 * The test output is mostly consistent with rules but likely incorrect in border decisions (overuse of 3s where dist > threshold) and possible missed lower influences on overlays (since even processed top-down, lower odd rows like row13 affect row12 overlay? Wait, code uses out[j+1] which is original until processed, but odd processed first so yes); to handle test, update border thresholds or search logic for right side.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8], while even rows start with a base of 8s (or 0s where input is 0), overlay 6s from adjacent rows, cap non-zero segment edges adjacent to 0s with 3s under conditions involving upper-row 6s, handle left/right borders specially based on proximity to upper 6s and input values, and extend border 3s inward in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only replace exact non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8,6,8]; do not touch other values or overlapping patterns.
 * Even rows use the original input grid (g) for base initialization and border decisions, but overlays and caps use the updated output grid (out) for adjacency checks to propagate changes from previously processed rows.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the upper or lower row (in out) has a 6 in the same column; this can create new 6s that affect later capping or bordering.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row (for non-top rows); skip right-edge capping on bottom rows; this prevents over-capping in isolated segments without upper influence.
 * Border handling (left/right) is complex: for non-top rows, set to 3 if there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left segment length, ideally min distance <=5; right: max distance <=4 from edge), or fall back to input value (3 if input is 3, else 8); top rows always get 8 on borders; bottom rows prioritize 3 if upper 6 condition met.
 * Extend border 3s inward by one position only if the next cell is 8, the row has no 0s, it's not the bottom row, and n >=2; this creates "thick" borders without zeros.
 * Process odd rows before even rows, and even rows top-to-bottom to ensure propagation; input g is preserved for base/border logic, but out is updated in place.
 * Subtle edge cases: zero segments skip all processing; top row has no upper, so no 6-based capping/bordering (defaults to 8s); bottom row skips right capping and some extensions; proximity calculations for borders use min/max distances to nearest upper 6 within the border segment; overlapping rules (e.g., overlay then cap) must be applied in sequence without revisiting.
 * All rows assume uniform width n; empty or single-row grids return unchanged; no diagonal or multi-row pattern matching beyond vertical adjacency for 6s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (full match on all rules like triple-7 replacement, 6 overlays, 3 capping, border setting, and inward extension).
 * What worked: Odd-row processing is solid (non-overlapping 7->868); even-row base init preserves input zeros correctly; 6 overlay propagates vertically as expected; capping applies 3s only to qualifying segment edges (e.g., adjacent to 0 with upper 6); borders use input fallbacks and distance-based 6 proximity accurately for training cases.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, several even rows show unexpected 3s or 8s on borders/internal positions (e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has internal 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 check, and right border 3 despite potentially distant upper 6); row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a mid-row 3 at col 9 that skips zero but may violate no-extension-over-zero; row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] overlays 6s correctly but lacks expected 3 caps around isolated 6s if adjacent to implied zeros (unknown if input has zeros there); overall, test output mismatches expected by having asymmetric border 3s (e.g., left 3 but right 8 in some rows where upper 6 proximity should symmetrize) and possible over-extension of 3s inward past 6s (e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends left/right 3s but interacts oddly with central 6).
 * Subtle misses in this attempt: Left border min_k <=5 threshold may be too loose for test (causing extra 3s); right border dist <=4 may under-cap in wider segments; overlay uses lower row prematurely (before its processing, leading to missing 6s from bottom-up propagation); cap function skips if no upper 6 but test may need input-based fallback; no function for extracting/validating full segments across rows (would help debug propagation).
 * Function `overlay_sixes_from_adjacents` is helpful but potentially broken for bottom rows (accesses unprocessed lower out); `set_left_border` has redundant while loop (inefficient but correct); `set_right_border` uses break after first 6 but computes max_k incorrectly if multiple (only takes last in reverse scan); no unhelpful functions noted, but main program assumes uniform n without checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., visible patterns of 6s overlaying vertically, 3s capping some zero-adjacent segments, border 3s in non-top rows, inward extensions like double 3s on edges without zeros) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Specific issues: Row 4 ends with [...,8,6,8,8,3] where right 3 caps a segment adjacent to zero, but if upper row (row 3) has no 6 over that segment, it shouldn't cap (unknown input, but generated 3 seems over-applied); row 10 has [...,3,0,8,... ,3] with left/mid/right 3s, but the 0 breaks the segment, so mid 3 at col9 shouldn't exist if it's not an edge; row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0] overlays 6 correctly from adjacents but lacks any 3 caps on its short non-zero segment edges, which should get 3s if upper (row 11) has 6 nearby (row 11 is all 0s in generated, but propagation may be off); row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] shows internal 3 at col8 splitting a zero, but capping should only edge non-zero segments, not insert mid-zero; asymmetries like row 2 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] having two 6s without border impact, while row 16 has three 6s but no 3s, suggest inconsistent proximity/dist thresholds; expected output should have more uniform border 3s (e.g., full left/right 3s where upper 6s are central) and no 3s over/near 6s unless edge-capping; the output propagates some 7-replacements (implied in odd rows like row 1,3) but test grid seems to lack 7s, so focus on even-row rules failing subtly (e.g., unknown why row 6 extends to [3,3,...,3,3] but includes a 6 without capping around it).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing a drawing or shape with symbols like 8 for lines, 6 for holes or overlays, 3 for edge caps, 7 for replaceable patterns, and 0 for empty space) that must be transformed according to layered rules: replacing specific sequences on odd rows, initializing and overlaying values on even rows based on adjacency, and applying border/edge modifications to create coherent shapes. The goal is to produce a modified grid that visually renders or completes the puzzle elements correctly, ensuring consistency across rows and handling interactions between adjacent rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triple 7s ([7,7,7]) appear only on odd-indexed rows (1-based or 0-based even/odd alternation) and must be replaced exactly with [8,6,8], skipping forward by 3 positions to avoid overlapping replacements; this is a preprocessing step before even-row modifications.
 * Even-indexed rows (starting from row 0) are initialized to 8 where the original grid has non-zero values (preserving 0s as empty), then overlaid with 6s in columns where the row above or below has a 6, simulating vertical propagation of "holes" or special markers.
 * Segment capping on even rows: Non-zero segments (runs of 8s or 6s) get their left/right edges set to 3 if adjacent to 0 and the upper row has a 6 in that segment; this only applies if not the bottom row for right edges, and it's skipped for top row borders.
 * Border handling is asymmetric and position-dependent: Left border of even rows sets to 3 if the connected segment has an upper 6 nearby (within the segment or close, with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or based on original; right border uses max_k distance <=4 for 3, else 8; top row borders are always 8.
 * Extend border 3s only on non-bottom even rows: If a border 3 is followed by an 8 (inward), extend the 3 one position inward to "thicken" or connect edges.
 * Subtleties include: No modifications to odd rows beyond initial 7-replacement; upper row for row 0 is treated as all 0s; segments are contiguous non-0 runs; left/right border logic checks the entire connected non-0 prefix/suffix for 6s in upper row, with distance thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist<=4) that seem tuned for specific shape widths (n=17 in test); is_bottom flag prevents certain extensions/caps; original g[j] used as fallback for borders if no upper 6.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays happen before capping/borders, so 6s can influence edge decisions; replacements only on odd rows, but overlays reference the modified out grid (including replaced odd rows); no handling for vertical 7s or other patterns; assumes uniform n across rows; 0s block segment extension but not overlay checks.
 * Across attempts (inferred from code evolution): Early versions might have missed adjacency for overlays or used wrong thresholds for borders (e.g., fixed dist=5 vs variable); need to copy rows to avoid mutating originals; handle empty/short rows gracefully.

(Note: Other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_base are also helpful for border logic but more specialized; the main program orchestrates them correctly for even rows after odd-row preprocessing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core rules for 7-replacement, even-row initialization/overlays, and basic segment capping/borders are correctly implemented for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Non-overlapping triple-7 replacement on odd rows preserves structure and introduces 6s correctly; overlay_sixes propagates 6s vertically using the updated out grid; cap_segment_edges identifies segments accurately and applies 3s only when upper 6 present and edges touch 0; border functions handle top-row simplicity (always 8) and fallbacks to original g_row.
 * What didn't work: In more complex test cases, border thresholds (left_min_k <=5, right_dist <=4) may be too rigid, potentially over- or under-applying 3s in wider shapes (e.g., if 6 is far from border, it might not cap when it should); extend_border_threes only extends inward by 1 if 3-8 adjacent, but might miss longer chains or bottom-row cases; no extraction of "objects" like full shapes, so holistic shape validation is absent—future attempts could add a function to detect connected components of 8/6/3 for debugging.
 * Earlier attempts (inferred): Likely missed odd-row preprocessing, leading to unchanged 7s in outputs; incorrect overlay ignoring lower rows; symmetric left/right borders causing mismatched 3 placements; unhelpful functions like naive full-grid replacements (e.g., replacing all 7s without triples) broke patterns—avoid them as they ignore row parity and sequencing.
 * Function `set_left_border` and `set_right_border` are helpful but subtle—broken if thresholds are wrong (e.g., always <=5 might cap too much in test); `extend_border_threes` is marginally helpful but limited to n>=2 and non-bottom, may not extend far enough for jagged edges.
 * Training 1 likely had simple horizontal shapes where overlays and caps aligned perfectly; Training 2 added vertical interactions, which passed, but test introduces multiple disjoint segments and wider n=17, exposing border distance issues.
 * No object extraction in this attempt, but adding one (e.g., find_segments returning list of (start,end,row) for non-0 runs) could help validate full shapes across rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, n=17) shows alternating even rows with mostly 8s, scattered 6s (e.g., positions 10,14 in row 0; 7,12 in row 2), 3s at borders/edges (e.g., row 4: 3 at 0,8,16; row 6: 3s at 0,1,15,16), and odd rows with sparse 8-6-8 or 0s (e.g., row 1: 8-6-8 at 9-11; row 3: 8-6-8 at 12-14), ending with more complex patterns in lower rows like row 16 with 6s at 3,6,12.
 * It makes partial sense: 6s propagate vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in rows 0,1,2,13,14), 3s cap segments near 6s (e.g., row 4 segment from 0-7 capped at 0, but 8 is 0 so isolated), and borders extend 3s (e.g., row 6 starts/ends with 3,3). This aligns with rules for shape rendering, like drawing bordered blobs with holes.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: In row 4, position 7 is 0 inside a potential segment (3,8s,0,3,...), which might be an overlay miss or uncapped gap—expected continuous 8/6 with 3 only at true edges; row 10 has 3 at 9 but 0 at 10, suggesting broken segment handling (perhaps left_border over-applied 3 without checking full connection); row 12 has 3,3 at start/end but no inner 3 extension where 8 follows, violating extend rule; lower rows (16-18) have denser 6s (e.g., row 16: 6 at 3,6,12; row 18: 6 at 3,12) but mismatched odd row 17 sparsity, possibly missing lower-row overlay influence or 7-replacement in upper odds. Differences from expected (mentally simulating rules on inferred input): More 0s in odd rows than expected (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 at 6-8, but if input had 7s elsewhere, they weren't replaced); border 3s in row 6 extend to two positions (3,3), good, but row 14 lacks similar for right side despite 6 at 7-8; overall, shapes look fragmented—expected smoother blobs (e.g., full-width 8s with internal 6 holes), but here disjoint (e.g., row 0 ends with 6 at 10, then 8s). Unknown why row 18 has 0 at 6-11 despite upper 6s, possibly base init ignored original non-0s.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like walls, paths, or patterns in a grid-based image) by applying row-specific rules: odd rows undergo pattern replacements, while even rows are initialized, overlaid, capped, and bordered according to adjacency and conditions involving 6s and 0s. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually matches an expected pattern, such as a stylized drawing or maze, by simulating rules that create borders (3s), paths (6s), fills (8s), and empties (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of [7,7,7] must be replaced with [8,6,8] to create "bridges" or paths; this is processed first and independently for all odd rows.
 * Even rows: Start with a base of 8 for non-zero input cells and 0 for zeros; then overlay 6s in positions where the upper or lower row (odd) has a 6 in the same column, simulating vertical continuity.
 * Segment capping in even rows: For non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left/right edges with 3 if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skip right cap on bottom row; this creates "guarded" edges but only for segments influenced by upper 6s.
 * Border handling in even rows: Left and right edges are set to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s (e.g., if a 6 is within ~5 positions on left or ~4 on right, use 3; otherwise 8), input values (prefer 3 if input is 3), and row position (top rows default to 8, bottom may force 3); this is separate from segment capping and focuses on the grid's outer borders.
 * Inward extension: In non-bottom even rows without zeros, extend border 3s inward by one position if followed by an 8, to "thicken" borders subtly.
 * Global considerations: Process odd rows fully before even rows; even rows are done top-to-bottom, relying on already-processed odd rows above; handle edge cases like single-row grids, zero-length rows, top/bottom status, and varying segment lengths; subtle misses include incorrect proximity distances (e.g., left uses <=5, right <=4), not skipping right caps only on bottom, or failing to check for upper 6s per segment/border.
 * Input assumptions: Grid has uniform width n, rows alternate even/odd starting at 0; numbers include 0 (empty), 3 (border), 6 (path), 7 (pre-replacement), 8 (fill); no overlapping replacements or backward passes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Borders check min/max k for 6 proximity differently on left/right; extensions only if no zeros and n>=2; overlays use already-processed adjacent rows, so order matters; caps and borders can interact (e.g., a border 3 might be overwritten or extended).

(The above functions are helpful for core transformations; others like set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_border_threes_inward are also useful but overly specific to proximity logic, which may need tuning; initialize_even_row_base is simple and correct but basic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row replacements, even-row basing, 6 overlays, and basic capping/bordering.
 * Worked well: Pattern replacement in odd rows is non-overlapping and forward-only, avoiding infinite loops; overlays correctly propagate 6s vertically using processed adjacent rows.
 * Did not work fully: Border proximity logic (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be arbitrary or incorrect for some cases, as it hardcodes distances that might not generalize; right border search starts from end but breaks on first 6, potentially missing closer ones if not reversed properly.
 * Capping skips right edges only on bottom, which is good, but may overcap if segments overlap with borders; extensions only apply if no zeros, which prevents artifacts but might miss partial fills.
 * Function set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are helpful but complex and potentially buggy in min/max k calculations (e.g., right_max_k init to -1, loop direction); they handle top/bottom and input_3 fallbacks correctly.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges correctly identifies segments and checks upper 6s per segment, but doesn't handle if upper row isn't processed yet (though main program orders it right).
 * Function extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and mostly correct but skips if any zero exists, which could prevent needed extensions in mixed rows.
 * Overall, the main program structure (odd first, then even top-to-bottom) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but earlier attempts (implied) might have missed order or proximity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a coherent 18-row grid (9 even, 9 odd) with consistent patterns: odd rows have isolated [8,6,8] amid 0s, even rows have fills of 8s interrupted by 6s and bordered by 3s, creating vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking across rows).
 * It looks mostly correct and sensible: Overlays propagate 6s properly (e.g., row 1's 6 at col 10 aligns with row 0's 6 there; row 3's [8,6,8] at cols 12-14 influences row 2 and 4); borders use 3s at edges where upper 6s are proximal (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at both ends extended inward).
 * Potential issues: Row 4 has a 3 at col 0, 8s, a 0 at col 7, then 3 at col 8, suggesting capping worked but the inner 3 might be from border logic overlapping a segment; row 10 has 3 at col 0, but a 0 at col 10 breaks continuity, and 3 at end—capping seems applied but extension skipped due to zero, which is correct per rules.
 * Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but no 3 caps visible around isolated 6s (since 6 overlays on base 8, not creating new segments adjacent to 0s); this matches rules as overlays don't trigger capping unless edges touch 0s with upper 6 condition.
 * Row 17 (odd) has scattered [8,6,8] and 0s, likely from input 7s replaced correctly; overall, the output visually forms connected paths/borders (e.g., vertical 6 channels at cols 7-8, 10-12), suggesting it makes sense for a puzzle like drawing outlines or mazes, but without expected output, can't confirm if border distances or specific 3 placements (e.g., row 11 all 0s, no influence) are exact—differences might be in unhandled input variations like non-7 patterns in odd rows.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10

**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving transformation of a 2D input grid (with rows of integers like 0,3,6,7,8) according to row-specific rules: odd rows handle replacements for patterns like triple 7s, while even rows initialize bases, overlay values from adjacent rows, cap segment edges, adjust borders based on proximity and input, and extend certain patterns inward. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually represents some structured pattern, likely a diagram or shape, by applying these rules consistently across all rows while respecting top/bottom boundaries and zero/non-zero segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8,6,8], but only in odd-indexed rows (0-based); no other changes to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base: positions are 8 if input !=0, else 0; then overlay 6 where the upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6 in the same column, but only if those adjacent rows exist.
 * Segment capping in even rows: for non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left edge with 3 if there's an upper 6 in that segment and left neighbor is 0; similarly for right edge with 3 if not bottom row, right neighbor 0, and upper 6 present—subtlety: this skips right cap on bottom row and only checks upper row for 6s (not lower or input).
 * Border setting (left/right) in even rows: if border position is non-zero, set to 8 on top row; otherwise, base on upper 6 proximity (e.g., left: 3 if upper 6 within segment or close (min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input-based 3); right similar but with distance (dist <=4 for 3); input g-row influences if no upper 6 (3 if input border is 3); subtlety: scans segment to find closest upper 6, and bottom rows favor 3 more aggressively.
 * Inward extension: only for non-bottom even rows without any 0s—if border is 3 followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one position (both sides if applicable); easy to miss: requires full-row non-zero and n>=2.
 * Global: process all odd rows first (top-to-bottom order implied but independent), then even rows top-to-bottom; output starts as copy of input but overwritten; assumptions: all rows length n, rectangular grid; zeros act as separators for segments; no overlapping replacements; subtle edge cases like single-cell segments, all-zero rows, or borders touching zeros.
 * Considerations across attempts: handle varying n (e.g., 17 in test); top row (j=0) has no upper, so borders default to 8; bottom row (is_bottom=True) skips right caps and favors 3s on borders; upper row for even j is the processed odd row above (or dummy [0]*n for j=0); input g is used for base init and border input checks, but out is the working grid for overlays/caps.
 * Potential misses: non-overlapping replacement means skipping after replace (i+=3); segment finding skips zeros and processes contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min_k/max_k but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right dist)—these may be puzzle-specific and easy to over/under-tune; no changes to odd rows beyond 777 replacement; even rows can end up with mixed 0/3/6/8 after all steps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like 777 replacement in odd rows and even row basing/overlays.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is solid (non-overlapping replaces); even row base init preserves zero positions; overlay uses both upper/lower correctly; segment capping applies 3s only where upper 6 present and adjacent to 0.
 * What didn't work: Border logic has hardcoded thresholds (left_min_k <=5, right dist<=4) which may not generalize—could be over-specific to training, leading to incorrect 3/8 choices in test if proximity rules differ; right border scan breaks at first upper 6 from right, but may miss if no 6 in segment; extension only for full non-zero rows, which might miss partial extensions.
 * Inward extension is limited to one position and only if exactly 3-8 adjacent—may not capture longer chains or different patterns.
 * Cap function skips bottom right caps entirely, which worked for training but could be a subtlety if test bottom row needs symmetric capping.
 * Overlay uses input g for lower row checks? No, it uses out[j+1], but since odd rows processed first, out[j+1] is updated if odd; for even j, lower is odd and already processed—correct, but if test has unprocessed lowers, issue (but code processes odds first).
 * No extraction functions for objects like segments or borders— all inline, which is helpful for direct transformation but harder to debug segments.
 * Function `overlay_sixes_from_adjacents` is helpful but note: it overlays on base without preserving prior 6s from base (but base is 0/8, so ok); `cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges` correctly identifies segments but only checks upper for 6s, ignoring input or lower—potential miss if puzzle requires broader checks.
 * Overall, program shows good structure (modular functions), but border proximity logic (min_k, dist) seems empirically tuned and may fail on test variations in 6 positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows? appears to be 18 even/odd pairs plus one, n=17) shows patterns like full 8-rows with 6 overlays, zero-separated segments capped with 3s, and border 3s extended in some non-bottom even rows (e.g., row 4: [3,8,8,...3] with left/right 3s, no inward extend visible as it has 0 inside).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows have 6s where 777 likely replaced (e.g., row 2: 6 at col 10, row 4: 6 at 13); even rows have 0s preserved, 6 overlays (e.g., row 1: 6 at 10 from above/below), 3 caps on segments near 0s with upper 6 (e.g., row 4 segment from col8-16 capped 3 at 8 and 16? but output has 3 at 0? wait, col0=3 but no left 0, likely border set).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 10 (even?): [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has 3 at col9 but segment seems col0-9 then 0 at10, then 11-16; if upper (row9) has 6 at col4, capping should apply left 3 at col0 if adjacent 0 (but left border), but right cap at col9=3 ok if upper 6 in segment and right 0; however, col0=3 suggests border set to 3 due to close upper 6 (min_k<=5), but expected might be 8 if farther—unknown if proximity threshold wrong, as output has unexpected 3 at col9 without clear right adjacency cap trigger.
 * Row 16 (even?): [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] looks like full row with 6s overlaid and borders 3—makes sense if no zeros and upper 6s trigger borders to 3, but if puzzle expects 8 borders without close 6s, this differs (e.g., 6s at col3,7,12 may set min_k/dist low enough for 3).
 * Row 17: [0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0] has isolated 8-6-8 segments, likely base 8 where input non-zero, overlaid 6—no 3 caps visible, correct if no upper 6 in those short segments or not adjacent to 0 in way that triggers (but they are isolated, so should cap if upper 6? wait, segments are non-zero flanked by 0, so if upper has 6 anywhere in seg, cap both ends to 3—but output has 8s at ends, so either no upper 6 in seg or cap logic missed; upper row16 has 6 at col3 (matches seg col2-4? col2=8,3=6,4=8 yes, so should cap left col2=3 and right col4=3 if not bottom—but output keeps 8s, so cap function broken for this: perhaps because overlay set 6 after base, but cap checks temp which has 6, but condition is segment_has_upper_6 which scans upper for 6 in start-end, yes should trigger—wait, discrepancy, cap likely applied but only if adjacent 0, which it is, so this indicates bug in cap or order).
 * Another difference: row 6 [3,3,8,...3,3] shows inward extension (3 at col1 and col15), correct if borders set to 3 and next is 8, no zeros; but if test expects no extension or different, it's over-applied.
 * Overall, test output follows program logic but likely incorrect in places like missing 3 caps on isolated segments with upper 6 (e.g., row17 segs should be [3,6,3] if upper 6 present, but are [8,6,8]—expected [3,6,3] per rules, so cap not triggering properly, perhaps because upper for row17 is row16 which has 6s, but code uses upper=out[j-1], yes; unknown why not capped, maybe segment detect skips if 6 already there? No, temp has 6 but non-zero. This suggests cap function is broken for segments containing 6s or short ones.
 * Borders in row 4: left 3 at col0, right 3 at col16, but middle 0 at col7—no extend across zero, correct; but if expected full borders without 3 if far from 6, differs.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:03:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., 777 to 868), and even rows are built by overlaying 6s based on adjacent rows, adding 3s at borders and edges adjacent to 0s under conditions involving upper-row 6s and distance constraints, with extensions for propagating 3s. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected visual patterns, likely representing some stylized or rule-based rendering of input shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first with left-to-right, non-overlapping replacement of 777 sequences to 868, but only if exactly three consecutive 7s; no overlapping or partial matches are handled.
 * Even rows start with 8s on non-zero input positions and 0s elsewhere, then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6 in the same column—note that lower row overlay uses future rows, which may cause ordering issues if not all rows are pre-processed.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments get 3s added to left/right edges only if adjacent to 0 and the segment contains at least one upper 6; right extension is skipped for bottom rows.
 * Border handling for even rows is asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper has a 6 within the segment (with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input 3; right border uses max_k with distance (n-1 - max_k) <=4 for non-bottom; top row forces 8s on borders; segments are scanned to find contiguous extents.
 * 3 extension in even rows propagates inward only at edges (e.g., 3-8 to 3-3) if no zeros in row and not bottom, but only for n>=2 and strictly at positions 0-1 or n-2 to n-1.
 * Input 3s can influence borders if no upper 6 condition met; all-zero even rows remain zero; processing order is odd rows first, then even rows sequentially from top to bottom, using already-processed out for overlays.
 * Subtle: Distance checks (e.g., <=5 left, <=4 right) seem arbitrary and may be puzzle-specific for shape rendering; bottom row skips some extensions; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays consider both upper and lower for 6s, but lower uses out[j+1] which for top-down processing means lower rows must be pre-finalized (but code processes odds first, evens top-down, so lower evens aren't processed yet—potential bug); segments ignore internal 0s? No, code finds contiguous non-zero segments.
 * All rows copy input initially, but evens are fully rebuilt; no handling for input values other than 0,3,6,7,8 assumed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_pattern(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Replaces non-overlapping 777 in odd rows with 868, scanning left-to-right.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < len(new_row) - 2:
        if new_row[i] == 7 and new_row[i + 1] == 7 and new_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This is helpful for odd-row pattern replacement, correctly non-overlapping and directional.)

```python
def get_6_overlay(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    # Initializes even row with 8s on non-zero input positions, then overlays 6s where adjacent (upper/lower) row has 6 in same column.
    new_row = [0 if g[j][k] == 0 else 8 for k in range(n)]
    has_upper = j > 0
    has_lower = j < len(g) - 1
    for k in range(n):
        from_upper = has_upper and out[j - 1][k] == 6
        from_lower = has_lower and out[j + 1][k] == 6
        if from_upper or from_lower:
            new_row[k] = 6
    return new_row
```
(This captures adjacency for 6 overlays but may be buggy due to unprocessed lower rows in top-down order.)

```python
def add_0_adjacent(temp: List[int], out: List[List[int]], j: int, n: int, is_bottom: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Finds non-zero segments in temp (even row), adds 3s to left/right edges adjacent to 0s if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skips right extension if bottom.
    # (Implementation as in provided code)
```
(Helpful for edge 3s on zero-adjacent segments, correctly checks per-segment upper 6 presence.)

(The other functions like add_border_3s and add_extension are somewhat helpful but overly complex and potentially incorrect in distance logic or segment scanning; program orchestrator is useful for sequencing but assumes fixed n.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row 777->868 replacement, basic 6 overlays, and some 3 placements.
 * Missed proper ordering for lower-row 6 overlays in even rows, as evens are processed top-down after odds, so out[j+1] for early evens references unprocessed lower evens (potentially causing missing 6s from future processing).
 * Border logic in add_border_3s is convoluted and likely wrong: left uses min_k <=5 (arbitrary, scans full left segment), right uses max_k with dist<=4 (scans backward but breaks early on first 6, ignoring farther ones?); doesn't handle input 3s consistently beyond borders.
 * Extension in add_extension only handles single-step inward propagation at very edges and skips if any zero or bottom, which may miss longer propagations or internal cases.
 * add_0_adjacent correctly identifies segments but only adds 3s to existing non-zero edge positions without expanding into 0s—wait, it sets the edge to 3 if already non-zero and condition met, but doesn't create new 3s in adjacent 0s.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., identifying shapes or blobs in input g), which might be needed if puzzle involves detecting connected components beyond simple patterns; none provided, so unhelpful for higher-level understanding.
 * Overall, core pattern replacement works, but even-row building has subtle bugs in dependencies and conditions, leading to incomplete 3/6 placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 18 rows (9 even, 9 odd?), with n=17 columns; odd rows have some 868 patterns and 6s, even rows mix 0s, 3s, 6s, 8s in ways that seem partially structured but inconsistent (e.g., row 0: all 8s except 6 at col 10; row 1: isolated 8-6-8 at cols 9-11 amid 0s).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 4 (even) has 3 at col0, 8s, 0 at col7, 3 at col8, then 8s to 6-8-8-3 at end— the isolated 0 at col7 splitting segments, but 3 at col8 suggests border/adjacent logic triggered oddly without clear upper 6 influence visible; similarly, row 5 all 0s despite potential overlays.
 * Row 10 (even) has 3-8s-6-8-8-3-0-8s-3, with a 0 at col10 breaking continuity, but 3s at edges without obvious zero-adjacent extension; this seems wrong as it leaves internal 0 amid non-zeros, possibly missing segment merging or improper overlay.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 16 even: 3-8s-6-8-8-0-3? Wait, shown as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) have 0 at col7, which shouldn't persist if input non-zero or overlay applies, indicating failed 8/6 filling.
 * Missing expected symmetry or full coverage: many even rows have trailing/leading 0s not filled to 3/8, and 6s appear sporadically without matching adjacent 6s in odds (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col10 and col13, but row 1 has 6 only at col10); distances for borders seem violated (e.g., right 3s far from any upper 6).
 * Overall, test output is incomplete and patchy, with unexplained 0s persisting in even rows and irregular 3 placements, suggesting bugs in overlay/segment/border logic prevent full shape rendering—does not match expected clean, connected patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) to generate a transformed output grid, likely representing patterns like walls, paths, or borders in a maze-like or ascii-art structure, with rules focused on replacing sequences in odd rows and conditionally overlaying/ capping values in even rows based on adjacency and segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8]; this seems straightforward and works consistently, but ensure no overlapping or partial matches interfere.
 * Even rows base: Non-zero input positions become 8, zeros stay 0; this initializes "filled" areas but must be overlaid carefully to avoid losing structure.
 * 6 overlays in even rows: Propagate 6 from directly above or below (in odd rows) to even row positions, but only if the adjacent row already has the 6 placed; this creates vertical continuity but can be missed if processing order skips updates.
 * Segment edge capping with 3: In even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s get 3 at edges only if the upper odd row has a 6 anywhere in that segment; avoid overriding existing 6s, and skip right-edge capping on bottom row; subtle: this is proximity-based, not direct adjacency, and only applies to non-zero segments.
 * Border handling (left col 0, right col n-1): For even rows, set to 3 if upper row has 6 nearby in the border segment (with distance <=5 for right border? code has dist calc), or if input was 3; force 8 on top row; avoid overriding 6s; subtle: left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist<=5, and bottom row treats as if has upper 6; input 3 can force 3 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of 3s: At edges of even rows, if 3 is at border followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one; only if no zeros in row and not bottom row; subtle: this creates "thickening" but can over-extend if misapplied, leading to unwanted 3s.
 * Processing order: Odd rows first (replacements), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> left border -> right border -> extend); this order matters as borders use already-processed upper rows, but overlays use input g (not out), which might cause inconsistencies if g has pre-6s.
 * General: Grid size n x num_rows, assume uniform width; 0s are "empty/gaps", 8s are default fill, 6s are special markers (perhaps "openings"), 3s are edge caps/borders; avoid changing 0s except via overlays; bottom row skips some right caps and extensions; top row forces 8s on borders.
 * Easy to miss: Border logic has asymmetric distance (left min_k<=5, right dist<=5 from end), input 3 preservation, and zero-check before extensions; overlays from lower row but code only checks upper/lower in out/g mix, potentially missing bottom-up propagation; no changes to odd rows after initial replacement.

(Note: Other functions like cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six, set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_threes_inward_at_edges are partially helpful for segment detection and border logic but are buggy in application—see previous attempts; no types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 incorrect: Generated row 4 (0-based even row) ends with [3,3] instead of [8,8], likely due to overzealous border 3 placement or inward extension applying wrongly despite no zeros; row 6 ends with [3,3] which matches expected, but overall mismatches suggest border logic (esp. right border dist<=5) or cap extension misfires on segments near end.
 * Training example 2 correct: All rules applied properly, indicating core replacement, overlay, and capping work for simpler cases without edge conflicts.
 * Missed: In border functions, right border distance calculation (dist = n-1 - right_max_k) and condition (dist <=5) may be too loose, causing unwanted 3s far from 6s; left border min_k <=5 is asymmetric and possibly incorrect for some grids.
 * Consider problems where segments span borders or upper 6s are distant, leading to false 3 caps; overlay uses mix of g and out, but lower row check uses out[row_index+1] which is unprocessed if top-to-bottom, potentially missing 6s placed later.
 * cap_segment_edges_with_three_if_upper_has_six skips right cap on bottom but applies left always; this works for train 2 but fails train 1's row 4 right end.
 * extend_threes_inward_at_edges only on non-bottom, no-zero rows, but in train 1 row 4, it wrongly extended to create extra 3s (or border did); function is helpful but condition has_zero = 0 in temp is too broad.
 * set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are essential for borders but broken: they force 3 too aggressively if upper has any 6 in segment (even distant), and input 3 fallback doesn't prevent 8 overrides; right border loop finds max_k incorrectly (breaks on first 6 from right, but should check whole right segment?).
 * initialize_even_row_base is correct and helpful for base setup.
 * Overall, processing even rows top-to-bottom works for propagation but lower overlay check in overlay_sixes_from_adjacents uses unprocessed out[row_index+1], which is still g— this might be why train 1 row 4 misses some overlays but gains wrong 3s.
 * No extraction functions like for objects/blobs; puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful if added).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It follows the replacement (e.g., 6s appear in odd rows like row 2 [8,8,8,...6,8,...]), overlays (e.g., even row 1 has 6s under odd row 0/2 6s), and some borders (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s where input likely has edges), but looks incorrect in several places—e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,...8,3] starts with 3 but if top-even, should force 8 unless input 3; row 10 [3,8,8,...8,3] has isolated 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 proximity; row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] extends 3s inward correctly but row 16 [8,8,8,6,...] has 6 overlays that seem fine, yet row 18 [3,8,8,6,...3] starts with 3 on odd? Wait, row 18 is odd (0-based 18 even? num_rows=19? assuming 19 rows), but odds shouldn't get border 3s—code only processes evens for borders, so if output has odd row changes, it's a bug; overall, extra 3s at left/right suggest border logic over-applies, and empty even rows (e.g., row 5 all 0s) correctly stay 0 but miss potential overlays from below; doesn't fully match expected mental run (e.g., row 4 should likely be more 8-filled without early 3 if no upper 6 segment), indicating same border/extension issues as train 1 persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid transformation puzzle where input grids of numbers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) are processed row-by-row following rules that distinguish between odd and even rows (0-indexed), involving sequence replacements in odd rows, initialization and overlays in even rows, edge capping with 3s based on adjacency to 0s and upper-row 6s, border settings influenced by input values and proximity to upper 6s, and inward extensions of 3s under specific conditions. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually represents some puzzle solution, likely encoding shapes or patterns through these numerical transformations, with training examples validating the rules on smaller grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1,3,5...) are processed first and independently: non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8], but shorter rows or non-matching sequences are unchanged; this must skip overlaps correctly by advancing i+=3 only on match.
 * Even rows (0,2,4...) initialize to 8 for non-zero input positions and 0 for zeros, then overlay 6s in columns where the immediate upper or lower row (already processed) has a 6; this creates vertical alignments of 6s.
 * After overlay, even rows cap the left and right edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s, but only if the segment has any upper-row 6 in its range; right capping is skipped for bottom rows; this prevents "dangling" 8s next to 0s when 6s are involved above.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left border (col 0) sets to 8 for top row, or 3 if upper has nearby 6 (within segment or <=5 cols for bottom/non-bottom), else based on input 3; right border (col n-1) similar but uses distance from rightmost upper 6 (<=4 cols triggers 3); falls back to input-driven 3 or 8 if no upper 6.
 * Inward extension of border 3s: for non-bottom even rows without any 0s, if border is 3 followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one position; this subtly widens borders but skips if zeros present or row too short.
 * Overall processing order: odd rows first (bottom-up or top-down doesn't matter since independent), then even rows top-to-bottom (to ensure upper rows are processed for overlays/caps); copy input to output initially to preserve non-transformed parts.
 * Subtleties: "Proximity" for borders uses min/max k for left/right upper 6s within the border segment; bottom rows avoid right capping and use looser left proximity (<=5); input g is used for base init and border fallbacks, but out is mutated progressively; empty/short grids return unchanged; assumes all rows same length n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check both upper/lower but only after odds processed (lowers may be odds); capping skips if no upper 6 even if segment exists; borders consider full left/right segments for 6 search; no changes if position already 6/3; potential for multiple passes or interactions missed if order wrong.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve 0s strictly except via overlays (which can turn 8/0 to 6); 7s only appear in odds and are fully replaced; visual output likely forms connected "blobs" of 8/6 with 3 borders and 0 gaps, possibly representing puzzle objects like shapes or paths; test grids are larger (17 cols, 19 rows?), so scale matters for segment finding.

(Note: The any() optimization in cap is helpful for efficiency in larger grids; original used a loop but same logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided, so no prior attempts to compare directly; however, the structure builds on implied earlier trials by modularizing into functions for odd processing, even base/overlay/cap/border/extend.
 * What worked: Odd row replacement correctly handles non-overlapping [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8], as validated by training examples passing; even row initialization preserves 0s and sets 8s; overlay propagates 6s vertically from adjacent rows accurately.
 * What didn't work: Border setting for left/right uses hardcoded distances (e.g., <=5 for left bottom, <=4 for right), which may be too rigid—training passed but could fail on varying segment lengths; inward extension skips if any 0 present, but might need per-border check; capping correctly identifies segments but assumes upper row processed (works top-to-bottom).
 * Subtle miss: In set_left_border and set_right_border, proximity searches start from segment ends but use global min_k/max_k; for right border, loop is backward (good), but dist calc is n-1 - right_max_k, which might undervalue long right segments in test.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges is helpful and core for edge 3s, but its segment_has_upper_6 check could be optimized; set_left_border and set_right_border are essential but overly complex—simplify proximity if possible.
 * extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and likely key for widening borders in solid rows, but untested in training (assumed correct since they passed).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant; earlier implied attempts might have lacked modularity, leading to monolithic main func errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row by 17-col grid with patterns of 8/6/3/0, including vertical 6 alignments (e.g., col 10 has 6s in rows 1,2,13,14), border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 10 has 3s at edges), and 0-filled even rows in places; it looks partially correct as it maintains 0 gaps and propagates 6s, but does not fully match expected visual coherence—e.g., row 4 has [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] with isolated 3 at col8 next to 0, which seems right for capping, but row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] lacks expected border 3s despite upper 6s nearby, suggesting border functions under-applied (possibly due to segment proximity thresholds like <=4/5 being too strict for this wider grid).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have more consistent 3 borders on even rows adjacent to 0s with upper 6s (e.g., row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a 0 in col10 breaking segment, but left segment caps to 3 correctly, right starts at col11 without left cap since not adjacent to 0—wait, col10=0 should cap col11 if upper 6, but output has 8 there, indicating cap function missed the post-0 segment); also, bottom rows (e.g., row 18) should avoid right 3s but output has them, mismatching is_bottom logic.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (6 overlays and odd replacements look good, forming blob-like structures with 0 voids), but borders/caps are inconsistent—e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends 3s inward correctly, but row 12 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has unexplained 3 at col9 without clear upper 6 adjacency; this suggests proximity rules need tuning for test's scale/spacing; it's different from a "correct" uniform bordering, likely due to hardcoded distances not generalizing.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements in a stylized font or pattern, such as Braille or dot-matrix characters) by applying transformation rules to even and odd rows, including pattern replacements, overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create a coherent output visualization. The goal is to generate an output grid that correctly renders the intended visual shapes based on input patterns, handling elements like 0 (empty), 3 (border/extension), 6 (overlay/protrusion), 7 (temporary pattern), and 8 (filled).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,4...) are the primary processing rows: they start with a base overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s from adjacent odd rows above/below, followed by filling adjacent 0s with 3s if segments have upper 6s, border-specific 3/8 decisions based on upper 6 proximity and input values (e.g., left/right edges check for 6s within certain distances like <=5 or <=4), and optional extensions turning 3-8 into 3-3 on edges if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,5...) are simpler: only replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties include row-specific behaviors (top row always uses 8 on borders, bottom row avoids certain extensions), distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., if upper 6 is far right, use 8 instead of 3 if dist >4 or >5), handling of zero segments (only affect adjacent non-zeros if upper 6 present), and preventing infinite loops in pattern processing by incrementing i+=3 after replacement.
 * Key considerations: Input may have pre-existing 3s on borders that influence outputs; empty rows (all 0s) should remain unchanged; grid dimensions vary (n columns, num_rows rows), assuming rectangular; process odd rows first (in place), then even rows using updated out; avoid over-applying extensions if zeros present or on bottom row; subtle asymmetry in left/right border checks (left looks for any upper 6 in segment, right checks max k and distance).
 * Easy-to-miss: The 6-overlay in even rows ignores self/input 6s (only from adjacent odd rows); border 3s depend on both upper 6 presence and input 3s as fallbacks; extensions only apply to edge 3-8 pairs, not internal; all changes are in-place on out grid copy.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of row alternation, pattern replacement, and basic overlays/extensions.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is precise and skips correctly; even-row base overlay and vertical 6 propagation match expected vertical alignments; border 3 placements correctly use input fallbacks and upper 6 checks; extensions handle edge 3-8 pairs without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential gaps in complex test cases with multiple 6s or long zero segments—e.g., the add_0_adjacent only fills leading/trailing 0s adjacent to segments with upper 6s, but may miss internal 0s or non-adjacent influences.
 * The full program structure (copy input to out, process odds first, then evens with temp steps) is solid and reusable; no unhelpful functions here—all are targeted (e.g., no generic extract_objects, as the puzzle is rule-based transformations, not object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) partially makes sense: It shows consistent even-odd alternation with 8-filled even rows, 6 placements in odd rows (e.g., isolated 6s or 8-6-8 patterns), border 3s on some even rows (e.g., row 4 has 3s at edges with internal 0 and 6), and zero rows preserved (e.g., row 5 all 0s). This aligns with rules like 6 overlays and border decisions.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several even rows have unexpected internal 0s persisting (e.g., row 0 has 6 at col 10 but leading/trailing 8s without adjacent 3-fills; row 2 has 6 at col 11 and 13 but no 3s filling nearby 0s from lower rows—wait, add_0_adjacent only checks upper, not lower, which might be a bug for bidirectional influence). Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but extensive 0s not filled, suggesting add_0_adjacent misses segments without upper 6s or mishandles multi-6 proximity. Bottom rows (e.g., row 18) have 3s but no extensions applied, which is correct per rules, but the overall shape looks jagged/incomplete (e.g., row 10 has isolated 0 at col 10 amid 8s/3s, possibly unfilled zero segment). Differences from expected: Expected smoother fills and more 3-extensions on non-bottom edges without zeros (e.g., row 6 should extend 3s further if no zeros); current output has more isolated 6s and 0s than a coherent visual (e.g., looks like fragmented letters/symbols rather than clean ones)—unknown why, but likely due to strict upper-only checks in add_0_adjacent and border distance thresholds being too conservative (e.g., right border in row 2 sets 8 instead of 3 despite nearby 6 at col 13).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving rule-based transformation of a 2D grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8), where odd rows undergo pattern replacement and even rows receive overlays, border adjustments, and extensions to create stylized shapes or patterns, possibly representing connected components or blob-like structures with specific edge and fill rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by replacing sequences of three 7s with 8,6,8, which acts as a compression or pattern simplification rule, but only applied sequentially without overlapping.
 * Even rows start with an 8-filled base where the original grid has non-zero values, then overlay 6s vertically from adjacent rows' 6s (both above and below), simulating propagation or connection across rows.
 * Adjacent 0s next to non-zero segments in even rows get 3s added at edges if the segment has an upper 6 nearby, but only on left/right borders of segments, and only if not the bottom row; this handles "dangling" or extension rules for shapes.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex: left/right edges get 3 if there's an upper 6 within a certain distance (e.g., <=5 for left, <=4 for right, adjusted for bottom rows), or fall back to original 3 or 8; top rows always use 8 on borders, preventing unwanted extensions at the grid top.
 * Extensions in even rows change adjacent 3-8 pairs to 3-3 on left/right if no zeros present and not bottom row, which seems to "thicken" or connect borders subtly.
 * Zero rows (all 0s) remain unchanged, acting as separators or empty space.
 * Subtle edge cases: bottom rows skip some lower checks and extensions; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., right border uses dist <=4 to place 3 vs 8) suggest asymmetry in horizontal propagation; original grid values influence fallbacks (e.g., input 3 preserves 3 on borders).
 * No diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond vertical 6 overlays; processing order matters (odd rows first, then even, using updated out grid).
 * Potential misses: Overlapping pattern replacements in odd rows aren't handled (simple while loop skips by 3); segments in add_0_adjacent ignore lower rows entirely; border logic has hardcoded distances (5/4) that may not generalize to all grid widths.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, indicating core row-processing logic (odd pattern replacement, even overlays and borders) captures basic rules.
 * Worked well for simpler patterns in training, as evidenced by correct outputs there, but may over-apply or under-apply border distances in wider grids.
 * add_border_3s function handles left/right asymmetry with specific thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4), which worked for training but could be a subtlety for test cases with offset 6s.
 * add_extension is helpful for connecting 3-8 to 3-3 but only applies if no zeros and not bottom, which prevented errors in training but might miss cases with partial zeros.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but unhelpful elements include the hardcoded distances in borders (potentially brittle); segment detection in add_0_adjacent is solid but ignores vertical lowers entirely, which might be a miss if bidirectional propagation is needed.
 * process_pattern skips correctly by 3 after replacement, avoiding overlaps, which was key to training success.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of parity-based processing and vertical 6 propagation, but border logic has unexplained asymmetries that could fail on test offsets.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns with many 8-filled rows interrupted by 6s, interspersed with mostly-zero rows and some 3 borders), forming symmetric blob-like structures (e.g., rows with 3 at ends connected via 8s and 6s).
 * It makes sense as a transformation: odd rows show 8,6,8 patterns without 7s (implying successful replacement if input had them), even rows have 6 overlays aligned vertically (e.g., column 10 has recurring 6s), and borders use 3s where shapes "touch" edges with upper influences.
 * However, some rows look incorrect or unexpected: e.g., row 4 (0-indexed? appears as [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3]) has isolated 0 in middle and asymmetric 3s, which might not match if rules should fill or connect across zeros without upper 6s; similarly, row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has three 6s that could be over-propagated if input lacks corresponding vertical sources.
 * Bottom rows (e.g., row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3]) retain middle 0 and add 3s, but if bottom skips extensions, this might preserve input gaps incorrectly—unknown without input, but differs from expected full connections in similar training patterns.
 * Zero rows (e.g., rows 5,11) are untouched, which is correct, but surrounding even rows have dangling 3s that might need better segment merging.
 * Overall, the output follows the program's rules consistently but may not be fully correct if test input expects more horizontal filling (e.g., 0s turning to 8s in connected blobs) or symmetric border 3s without the observed gaps; the asymmetry in 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10 and 13) suggests possible misalignment from vertical overlay.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines or shapes in a pixel art style, such as letters or symbols) by applying row-specific rules to odd and even rows, including pattern replacements, vertical overlays, and edge modifications to create connected or capped structures. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually renders the intended puzzle solution, such as stylized text or diagrams, while preserving non-zero elements and handling zeros as gaps or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows undergo non-overlapping replacement of three consecutive 7s with [8,6,8], which appears to "thicken" or connect horizontal lines, but only applies to sequences of exactly three 7s without overlap, potentially missing longer runs of 7s that might need multiple replacements or different handling.
 * Even rows start by copying non-zero input values to 8s (with zeros staying 0), then overlay 6s vertically where adjacent rows (upper or lower) have 6s in the same column, simulating vertical connections or propagations that bridge shapes across rows.
 * Edge capping with 3s in even rows occurs at the boundaries of non-zero segments adjacent to zeros, but only if the segment is "connected" via an upper row 6 somewhere within its span; right edges skip this if it's the bottom row, and borders have asymmetric rules based on proximity to upper 6s (left uses min_k <=5, right uses dist <=4 from edge).
 * Full-span even rows (no zeros) get inward extension of 3s from edges if they start/end with 3-8 or 8-3 patterns, but only for non-bottom rows, which handles "thickening" borders in continuous shapes but skips gapped or bottom rows.
 * Zeros act as gaps that isolate segments, preventing 3-capping across them, and the entire process copies the input initially before modifications, ensuring unchanged elements like existing 3s or 6s persist unless overridden.
 * Subtle asymmetries: Left borders prioritize closeness to upper 6s within 5 columns, right within 4; top rows force 8s on borders; bottom rows force 3s on borders if upper-connected; input 3s act as fallbacks for borders without upper 6s.
 * Potential misses: The rules don't handle horizontal extensions beyond edges, multiple overlapping vertical 6 propagations, or odd-row interactions beyond 777 replacement; longer 7 sequences (e.g., six 7s) might need repeated application; no diagonal considerations or global shape detection.
 * Visual intent: Numbers likely represent stroke styles (8=straight line, 6=curve/connector, 3=cap/end, 7=raw input line, 0=empty), aiming for smooth, connected renderings like in ASCII art or dot-matrix fonts.

(The other functions like set_border_3_based_on_upper_6_proximity and extend_inward_3_at_edges are helpful for border-specific logic but overly complex and asymmetric, potentially overfitted; simplify in future.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations, but the program demonstrates understanding of row alternation (odd: replace 777; even: overlay and cap).
 * Successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely, indicating core rules for 777 replacement, vertical 6 overlay, and basic edge 3-capping work for simpler cases.
 * Introduces segment-based processing for gaps (zeros), which is correct for isolating shapes but may miss multi-row interactions beyond immediate adjacents.
 * Border handling is helpful but subtle and asymmetric (left <=5, right <=4), which might be over-specific to training data; fallback to input 3s is a good consideration.
 * No object extraction function is present or needed, as rules are local per row/segment rather than global shape detection.
 * The main program composition (copy input, process odds first, then evens top-to-bottom) is essential and works, but even-row processing order (overlay -> add 3s -> borders -> extend) might cause overrides if not careful.
 * Unhelpful: No global validation or rendering check; the extend_inward_3_at_edges is conditionally narrow (only full-span, non-bottom) and may not generalize.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 19 rows (odd number, possibly including a partial grid or error in row count), with patterns like full 8/6 spans in odd rows (e.g., row 0: mostly 8s with a 6), gapped even rows (e.g., row 1: isolated 8,6,8), and 3-capped segments (e.g., row 4: 3 at starts/ends of segments).
 * It partially looks correct: 777 replacements seem applied (no visible 7s left), vertical 6 overlays connect across rows (e.g., 6s align in columns like col 10-11), and 3s cap edges near zeros (e.g., row 4 has 3s at positions 0,8,16 adjacent to zeros, with inner 6s).
 * However, it does not fully look correct: Some even rows have unexpected 3 extensions or missing caps (e.g., row 10: 3 at 1? but code has left border logic; row 4 ends with 3 but segment spans to col 16 without right zero? Wait, col 16=8, col 17? Grid width=17, but unclear input); bottom-like rows (e.g., row 18?) lack 3s where expected if bottom. Also, row 6 has 3s at 0-1 and 15-16, suggesting inward extension worked, but asymmetry in right borders (e.g., row 10 right 3 with dist>4?) might mismatch if upper 6s are far.
 * Differences from expected: Without explicit test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but generated has isolated segments without full 3-capping (e.g., row 1: 8,6,8 uncapped left/right despite upper 6? Code checks upper for segment, but if no upper 6 in span, no 3—possibly correct but feels open-ended visually); potential over-application of borders (e.g., row 4 left 3 despite full left span?); some rows like 12 mirror earlier patterns, suggesting repetition but maybe missing unique test logic like longer 7 runs or diagonal-ish connections. Overall, it demonstrates partial understanding but likely fails subtle test cases due to rigid proximity thresholds and no handling for lower-row influences beyond overlay.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to transform input patterns (likely representing pixelated shapes or letters) into output grids with specific numerical values (0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special overlays/indents, 3 for edge caps/borders) following alternating row rules for odd and even rows, aimed at rendering consistent visual elements like letters or symbols across multiple training and test cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed independently by replacing non-overlapping sequences of [7, 7, 7] with [8, 6, 8], which introduces indents (6s) into filled areas; this must handle short rows gracefully without errors.
 * Even rows start with a base of 8 where the input is non-zero (else 0), then overlay 6s in columns where the upper or lower row (after odd processing) has a 6 in the same position, simulating vertical alignment or inheritance of indents.
 * Internal edges of non-zero segments in even rows are capped with 3s if adjacent to 0s and the segment has an upper 6 nearby; right caps are skipped on the bottom row to avoid over-capping.
 * Left and right borders (columns 0 and n-1) in even rows have special logic: for left, set to 3 if not top row and either bottom row, upper 6 proximity within 5 columns, or input is 3; else 8. For right, similar but proximity measured as distance from rightmost upper 6, capped at 4 columns for 3, and considers input 3.
 * Border 3s extend inward by one if followed/preceded by 8 in non-bottom, fully non-zero rows, to smooth edges.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom, using updated out grid for adjacencies; assumes uniform column count n across rows.
 * Subtleties include handling top/bottom rows differently (e.g., no upper for top, no right cap on bottom), segment detection for caps (skipping zeros to find non-zero runs), and proximity checks (min_k for left, max_k/dist for right) which may miss distant 6s incorrectly.
 * Edge cases: empty grid, single row, short segments (<3), full non-zero rows, isolated 6s, and input values like 3 influencing borders without overriding overlays.
 * Visual intent seems to render bolded or outlined letters (e.g., 8 for body, 6 for inner curves/holes, 3 for serifs/edges), maintaining connectivity across rows.

    # (as provided; key for internal edge handling, but skips bottom right correctly)
```

(The other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_row_base are also helpful for border logic and extensions, forming a complete pipeline. No types beyond List[int] are used, but assuming uniform n columns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both fully, indicating solid grasp of core odd-row replacement and even-row base/overlay/capping.
 * What worked: Odd row [7,7,7] -> [8,6,8] replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row 6 overlays propagate vertically accurately; internal 3 caps detect segments and upper 6s correctly.
 * What didn't work: Border logic (left/right set_ functions) may over- or under-apply 3s based on proximity thresholds (e.g., left <=5, right <=4), potentially mismatching subtle edge cases in test; extend_border_threes skips if any 0 present, which might miss partial extensions.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds a full program; unhelpful elements include none explicitly, though the right border's dist <=4 (vs left's <=5) asymmetry feels arbitrary and may be a subtlety missed.
 * Function cap_internal_edges_with_three is helpful but could be broken for multi-6 segments if upper check loops inefficiently (though it works for trainings).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (odd number, so ends with even row?) with patterned 8/6/3/0 placements, showing vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking in columns like 10-11, 13-14) and border 3s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at ends), which visually suggests rendering multiple letters/symbols (e.g., possible "A" or "O" shapes with indents).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the code's logic: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 likely from 777 replacement; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row 1/3; borders like row 4's left 3 and right 3 align with upper 6 proximity.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even?) has isolated 8,6,8 at cols 3-5 but no 3 caps despite adjacent 0s and possible upper 6 (from row 9's 6 at col 4?); row 16 (even) has 6 at col 2 but no border adjustment; row 18's right side lacks expected 3 extension despite 8s; differences from expected include over-8ing borders (e.g., row 0 all 8s, possibly missing top-row nuance) and uneven 6 propagation (e.g., col 6 has sporadic 6s without full vertical overlay). Unknown why right borders in rows 4/10/16 don't cap symmetrically to left, but it IS different from a consistent visual (e.g., expected more 3s on right for balance).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace sequences of [7,7,7] with [8,6,8] non-overlappingly, while even rows start with an 8/0 base (8 for non-zero input, 0 for zero), overlay 6s based on adjacent rows' 6s, cap edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s with 3s if the segment has an upper 6, handle borders specially (setting to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s, input values, and top/bottom status), and optionally extend border 3s inward if followed/preceded by 8s in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only non-overlapping [7,7,7] sequences are replaced with [8,6,8]; shorter rows or non-matching sequences pass through unchanged; no other modifications to odd rows.
 * Even rows use the original input for base initialization and border checks but build on top of processed odd rows for overlays and caps; base is strictly 8 for any non-zero input cell, 0 for zero, ignoring processed values.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the exact same column in upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6; this can propagate vertically but only affects even rows.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments in even rows that are adjacent to 0s (left or right), and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row above any part of it; right cap is skipped in bottom row; this creates "capped" borders on islands of non-zeros.
 * Border handling for even rows is complex and position-specific: left/right edges of the entire row (if non-zero) are set to 3 or 8 based on whether there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left non-zero segment; right: closest upper 6 from the right, with distance thresholds like <=5 for left or <=4 for right to decide 3 vs 8); top row always gets 8 on borders; bottom row influences left/right to prefer 3 if upper 6 present; falls back to input 3 for 3 or 8 otherwise.
 * Extension of border 3s inward happens only in non-bottom even rows that have no zeros at all and length >=2: if border is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 one position inward (both sides independently).
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (base -> overlay -> cap -> borders -> extend); this ensures upper odd rows influence lower even rows correctly, but lower odd rows don't retroactively affect upper even rows.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: non-overlapping replacement in odd rows skips after replacement (i +=3); segment detection in caps scans contiguous non-zeros; border proximity uses min_k for left (any in left segment) but max_k/dist for right (closest from right end); input_row used only for base and border fallbacks, not for overlays/caps; zeros in even rows stay zero unless overlaid/capped/bordered; no diagonal or horizontal propagation beyond specified.
 * Edge cases: empty/short grids return unchanged; single-row (even or odd) handled appropriately; bottom row skips right caps and some extensions; full-8 rows without zeros enable extensions; multiple segments per row handled independently for caps but borders look at whole-row edges.
 * All considerations: vertical adjacency for 6 overlays (upper/lower); horizontal contiguity for segments/caps; distance-based decisions for borders (e.g., left min_k <=5, right dist <=4); top/bottom special casing; no changes to odd rows after initial process; even rows can introduce 3s/6s where input was non-zero/zero but rules apply.

(Note: Other functions like initialize_even_base, handle_borders, extend_border_threes, and the main program orchestrator are also helpful for base setup, complex border logic, and final extensions, as they passed training; no object extraction functions are needed or present, as this is rule-based transformation without higher-level "objects" like blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like odd-row [7,7,7] replacement, even-row 8/0 base, vertical 6 overlays, segment-based 3 capping conditional on upper 6s, and basic border 3/8 decisions.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is precise and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically as expected; capping isolates segments correctly and respects bottom-row no-right-cap; extensions only apply to full non-zero non-bottom rows.
 * What didn't work: Border handling in handle_borders may have subtle flaws in proximity calculations (e.g., left uses any upper 6 in segment but thresholds like <=5; right uses closest from end with <=4 dist), potentially misapplying 3 vs 8 in test cases with distant upper 6s; extension skips rows with any zero, which might miss partial extensions; no handling for input values other than 0/3/7/8/6 assumed, could fail on unknowns.
 * The program processes even rows top-to-bottom, which works for training but might not account for lower odd rows influencing upper even overlays if order changed (but current order matches needs).
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one shows partial understanding: core transformations pass training, but test output suggests possible over-application of 3s or missed extensions in complex layouts.
 * Function handle_borders is helpful but overly complex and potentially buggy in right-border distance (searches from right but breaks on first 6, using dist = n-1 - right_max_k); could be refined for accuracy.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though cap_adjacent_zeros skips if no upper 6 even if segment needs capping otherwise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 18-row by 17-column grid with patterns of 8s forming backgrounds/islands, 6s in vertical alignments (e.g., columns 10-11 have recurring 6s across rows), 3s capping edges of segments (e.g., row 4 [bottom]: 3 at ends of main island; row 10: 3s at positions 1,9,16), and 0s as gaps/spacers; odd rows have 8/6 patterns from 7 replacements, even rows show overlays and caps.
 * The test output makes sense overall as it follows the rules: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 from likely [7,7,7]; row 2 (even) overlays 6 at col 10 from row1/3; row 4 (even) has 3 caps at ends where adjacent to 0s and upper row3 has 6s; borders often 8 or 3 based on proximity (e.g., row 4 right 3 near upper 6 at col13).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle ways: e.g., row 10 (even) has a 0 at col10 but surrounding 8s/3s suggest possible missed overlay from lower row11 (all 0s, so no); row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but input/base might not justify if no adjacent 6s; row 18 (even, bottom?) shows 3 caps but if bottom, right cap should be skipped yet has 3 at end—wait, grid has 18 rows, if 0-indexed row17 is bottom, but listing suggests possible miscount; extensions seem missing in some full-8 rows like row 8 (has 6s, no extend); differences from expected: more 3s on left borders than anticipated (e.g., row 4 starts with 3, but if no close upper 6, should be 8); unknown why row 10 has isolated 0 at col10 amid 8s—possibly uncapped zero not adjacent to upper 6.
 * The test output is mostly consistent with rules but likely incorrect in border decisions (overuse of 3s where dist > threshold) and possible missed lower influences on overlays (since even processed top-down, lower odd rows like row13 affect row12 overlay? Wait, code uses out[j+1] which is original until processed, but odd processed first so yes); to handle test, update border thresholds or search logic for right side.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) into an output grid by applying row-specific rules: odd rows replace non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8], while even rows start with a base of 8s (or 0s where input is 0), overlay 6s from adjacent rows, cap non-zero segment edges adjacent to 0s with 3s under conditions involving upper-row 6s, handle left/right borders specially based on proximity to upper 6s and input values, and extend border 3s inward in non-bottom rows without zeros.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: only replace exact non-overlapping sequences of three 7s with [8,6,8]; do not touch other values or overlapping patterns.
 * Even rows use the original input grid (g) for base initialization and border decisions, but overlays and caps use the updated output grid (out) for adjacency checks to propagate changes from previously processed rows.
 * Overlay 6s in even rows only where the upper or lower row (in out) has a 6 in the same column; this can create new 6s that affect later capping or bordering.
 * Capping with 3s applies only to edges of non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, and only if the segment has at least one 6 in the upper row (for non-top rows); skip right-edge capping on bottom rows; this prevents over-capping in isolated segments without upper influence.
 * Border handling (left/right) is complex: for non-top rows, set to 3 if there's an upper 6 nearby (left: within the left segment length, ideally min distance <=5; right: max distance <=4 from edge), or fall back to input value (3 if input is 3, else 8); top rows always get 8 on borders; bottom rows prioritize 3 if upper 6 condition met.
 * Extend border 3s inward by one position only if the next cell is 8, the row has no 0s, it's not the bottom row, and n >=2; this creates "thick" borders without zeros.
 * Process odd rows before even rows, and even rows top-to-bottom to ensure propagation; input g is preserved for base/border logic, but out is updated in place.
 * Subtle edge cases: zero segments skip all processing; top row has no upper, so no 6-based capping/bordering (defaults to 8s); bottom row skips right capping and some extensions; proximity calculations for borders use min/max distances to nearest upper 6 within the border segment; overlapping rules (e.g., overlay then cap) must be applied in sequence without revisiting.
 * All rows assume uniform width n; empty or single-row grids return unchanged; no diagonal or multi-row pattern matching beyond vertical adjacency for 6s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 completely (full match on all rules like triple-7 replacement, 6 overlays, 3 capping, border setting, and inward extension).
 * What worked: Odd-row processing is solid (non-overlapping 7->868); even-row base init preserves input zeros correctly; 6 overlay propagates vertically as expected; capping applies 3s only to qualifying segment edges (e.g., adjacent to 0 with upper 6); borders use input fallbacks and distance-based 6 proximity accurately for training cases.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, several even rows show unexpected 3s or 8s on borders/internal positions (e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has internal 3s that may over-cap without upper 6 check, and right border 3 despite potentially distant upper 6); row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has a mid-row 3 at col 9 that skips zero but may violate no-extension-over-zero; row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] overlays 6s correctly but lacks expected 3 caps around isolated 6s if adjacent to implied zeros (unknown if input has zeros there); overall, test output mismatches expected by having asymmetric border 3s (e.g., left 3 but right 8 in some rows where upper 6 proximity should symmetrize) and possible over-extension of 3s inward past 6s (e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3] extends left/right 3s but interacts oddly with central 6).
 * Subtle misses in this attempt: Left border min_k <=5 threshold may be too loose for test (causing extra 3s); right border dist <=4 may under-cap in wider segments; overlay uses lower row prematurely (before its processing, leading to missing 6s from bottom-up propagation); cap function skips if no upper 6 but test may need input-based fallback; no function for extracting/validating full segments across rows (would help debug propagation).
 * Function `overlay_sixes_from_adjacents` is helpful but potentially broken for bottom rows (accesses unprocessed lower out); `set_left_border` has redundant while loop (inefficient but correct); `set_right_border` uses break after first 6 but computes max_k incorrectly if multiple (only takes last in reverse scan); no unhelpful functions noted, but main program assumes uniform n without checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., visible patterns of 6s overlaying vertically, 3s capping some zero-adjacent segments, border 3s in non-top rows, inward extensions like double 3s on edges without zeros) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Specific issues: Row 4 ends with [...,8,6,8,8,3] where right 3 caps a segment adjacent to zero, but if upper row (row 3) has no 6 over that segment, it shouldn't cap (unknown input, but generated 3 seems over-applied); row 10 has [...,3,0,8,... ,3] with left/mid/right 3s, but the 0 breaks the segment, so mid 3 at col9 shouldn't exist if it's not an edge; row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0] overlays 6 correctly from adjacents but lacks any 3 caps on its short non-zero segment edges, which should get 3s if upper (row 11) has 6 nearby (row 11 is all 0s in generated, but propagation may be off); row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] shows internal 3 at col8 splitting a zero, but capping should only edge non-zero segments, not insert mid-zero; asymmetries like row 2 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] having two 6s without border impact, while row 16 has three 6s but no 3s, suggest inconsistent proximity/dist thresholds; expected output should have more uniform border 3s (e.g., full left/right 3s where upper 6s are central) and no 3s over/near 6s unless edge-capping; the output propagates some 7-replacements (implied in odd rows like row 1,3) but test grid seems to lack 7s, so focus on even-row rules failing subtly (e.g., unknown why row 6 extends to [3,3,...,3,3] but includes a 6 without capping around it).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing a drawing or shape with symbols like 8 for lines, 6 for holes or overlays, 3 for edge caps, 7 for replaceable patterns, and 0 for empty space) that must be transformed according to layered rules: replacing specific sequences on odd rows, initializing and overlaying values on even rows based on adjacency, and applying border/edge modifications to create coherent shapes. The goal is to produce a modified grid that visually renders or completes the puzzle elements correctly, ensuring consistency across rows and handling interactions between adjacent rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triple 7s ([7,7,7]) appear only on odd-indexed rows (1-based or 0-based even/odd alternation) and must be replaced exactly with [8,6,8], skipping forward by 3 positions to avoid overlapping replacements; this is a preprocessing step before even-row modifications.
 * Even-indexed rows (starting from row 0) are initialized to 8 where the original grid has non-zero values (preserving 0s as empty), then overlaid with 6s in columns where the row above or below has a 6, simulating vertical propagation of "holes" or special markers.
 * Segment capping on even rows: Non-zero segments (runs of 8s or 6s) get their left/right edges set to 3 if adjacent to 0 and the upper row has a 6 in that segment; this only applies if not the bottom row for right edges, and it's skipped for top row borders.
 * Border handling is asymmetric and position-dependent: Left border of even rows sets to 3 if the connected segment has an upper 6 nearby (within the segment or close, with min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or based on original; right border uses max_k distance <=4 for 3, else 8; top row borders are always 8.
 * Extend border 3s only on non-bottom even rows: If a border 3 is followed by an 8 (inward), extend the 3 one position inward to "thicken" or connect edges.
 * Subtleties include: No modifications to odd rows beyond initial 7-replacement; upper row for row 0 is treated as all 0s; segments are contiguous non-0 runs; left/right border logic checks the entire connected non-0 prefix/suffix for 6s in upper row, with distance thresholds (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist<=4) that seem tuned for specific shape widths (n=17 in test); is_bottom flag prevents certain extensions/caps; original g[j] used as fallback for borders if no upper 6.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays happen before capping/borders, so 6s can influence edge decisions; replacements only on odd rows, but overlays reference the modified out grid (including replaced odd rows); no handling for vertical 7s or other patterns; assumes uniform n across rows; 0s block segment extension but not overlay checks.
 * Across attempts (inferred from code evolution): Early versions might have missed adjacency for overlays or used wrong thresholds for borders (e.g., fixed dist=5 vs variable); need to copy rows to avoid mutating originals; handle empty/short rows gracefully.

(Note: Other functions like set_left_border, set_right_border, extend_border_threes, and initialize_even_base are also helpful for border logic but more specialized; the main program orchestrates them correctly for even rows after odd-row preprocessing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core rules for 7-replacement, even-row initialization/overlays, and basic segment capping/borders are correctly implemented for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Non-overlapping triple-7 replacement on odd rows preserves structure and introduces 6s correctly; overlay_sixes propagates 6s vertically using the updated out grid; cap_segment_edges identifies segments accurately and applies 3s only when upper 6 present and edges touch 0; border functions handle top-row simplicity (always 8) and fallbacks to original g_row.
 * What didn't work: In more complex test cases, border thresholds (left_min_k <=5, right_dist <=4) may be too rigid, potentially over- or under-applying 3s in wider shapes (e.g., if 6 is far from border, it might not cap when it should); extend_border_threes only extends inward by 1 if 3-8 adjacent, but might miss longer chains or bottom-row cases; no extraction of "objects" like full shapes, so holistic shape validation is absent—future attempts could add a function to detect connected components of 8/6/3 for debugging.
 * Earlier attempts (inferred): Likely missed odd-row preprocessing, leading to unchanged 7s in outputs; incorrect overlay ignoring lower rows; symmetric left/right borders causing mismatched 3 placements; unhelpful functions like naive full-grid replacements (e.g., replacing all 7s without triples) broke patterns—avoid them as they ignore row parity and sequencing.
 * Function `set_left_border` and `set_right_border` are helpful but subtle—broken if thresholds are wrong (e.g., always <=5 might cap too much in test); `extend_border_threes` is marginally helpful but limited to n>=2 and non-bottom, may not extend far enough for jagged edges.
 * Training 1 likely had simple horizontal shapes where overlays and caps aligned perfectly; Training 2 added vertical interactions, which passed, but test introduces multiple disjoint segments and wider n=17, exposing border distance issues.
 * No object extraction in this attempt, but adding one (e.g., find_segments returning list of (start,end,row) for non-0 runs) could help validate full shapes across rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, n=17) shows alternating even rows with mostly 8s, scattered 6s (e.g., positions 10,14 in row 0; 7,12 in row 2), 3s at borders/edges (e.g., row 4: 3 at 0,8,16; row 6: 3s at 0,1,15,16), and odd rows with sparse 8-6-8 or 0s (e.g., row 1: 8-6-8 at 9-11; row 3: 8-6-8 at 12-14), ending with more complex patterns in lower rows like row 16 with 6s at 3,6,12.
 * It makes partial sense: 6s propagate vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in rows 0,1,2,13,14), 3s cap segments near 6s (e.g., row 4 segment from 0-7 capped at 0, but 8 is 0 so isolated), and borders extend 3s (e.g., row 6 starts/ends with 3,3). This aligns with rules for shape rendering, like drawing bordered blobs with holes.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: In row 4, position 7 is 0 inside a potential segment (3,8s,0,3,...), which might be an overlay miss or uncapped gap—expected continuous 8/6 with 3 only at true edges; row 10 has 3 at 9 but 0 at 10, suggesting broken segment handling (perhaps left_border over-applied 3 without checking full connection); row 12 has 3,3 at start/end but no inner 3 extension where 8 follows, violating extend rule; lower rows (16-18) have denser 6s (e.g., row 16: 6 at 3,6,12; row 18: 6 at 3,12) but mismatched odd row 17 sparsity, possibly missing lower-row overlay influence or 7-replacement in upper odds. Differences from expected (mentally simulating rules on inferred input): More 0s in odd rows than expected (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 at 6-8, but if input had 7s elsewhere, they weren't replaced); border 3s in row 6 extend to two positions (3,3), good, but row 14 lacks similar for right side despite 6 at 7-8; overall, shapes look fragmented—expected smoother blobs (e.g., full-width 8s with internal 6 holes), but here disjoint (e.g., row 0 ends with 6 at 10, then 8s). Unknown why row 18 has 0 at 6-11 despite upper 6s, possibly base init ignored original non-0s.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving transformation of a 2D input grid (with rows of integers like 0,3,6,7,8) according to row-specific rules: odd rows handle replacements for patterns like triple 7s, while even rows initialize bases, overlay values from adjacent rows, cap segment edges, adjust borders based on proximity and input, and extend certain patterns inward. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually represents some structured pattern, likely a diagram or shape, by applying these rules consistently across all rows while respecting top/bottom boundaries and zero/non-zero segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8,6,8], but only in odd-indexed rows (0-based); no other changes to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base: positions are 8 if input !=0, else 0; then overlay 6 where the upper (j-1) or lower (j+1) row has a 6 in the same column, but only if those adjacent rows exist.
 * Segment capping in even rows: for non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left edge with 3 if there's an upper 6 in that segment and left neighbor is 0; similarly for right edge with 3 if not bottom row, right neighbor 0, and upper 6 present—subtlety: this skips right cap on bottom row and only checks upper row for 6s (not lower or input).
 * Border setting (left/right) in even rows: if border position is non-zero, set to 8 on top row; otherwise, base on upper 6 proximity (e.g., left: 3 if upper 6 within segment or close (min_k <=5 for non-bottom), else 8 or input-based 3); right similar but with distance (dist <=4 for 3); input g-row influences if no upper 6 (3 if input border is 3); subtlety: scans segment to find closest upper 6, and bottom rows favor 3 more aggressively.
 * Inward extension: only for non-bottom even rows without any 0s—if border is 3 followed by 8, extend 3 inward by one position (both sides if applicable); easy to miss: requires full-row non-zero and n>=2.
 * Global: process all odd rows first (top-to-bottom order implied but independent), then even rows top-to-bottom; output starts as copy of input but overwritten; assumptions: all rows length n, rectangular grid; zeros act as separators for segments; no overlapping replacements; subtle edge cases like single-cell segments, all-zero rows, or borders touching zeros.
 * Considerations across attempts: handle varying n (e.g., 17 in test); top row (j=0) has no upper, so borders default to 8; bottom row (is_bottom=True) skips right caps and favors 3s on borders; upper row for even j is the processed odd row above (or dummy [0]*n for j=0); input g is used for base init and border input checks, but out is the working grid for overlays/caps.
 * Potential misses: non-overlapping replacement means skipping after replace (i+=3); segment finding skips zeros and processes contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min_k/max_k but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right dist)—these may be puzzle-specific and easy to over/under-tune; no changes to odd rows beyond 777 replacement; even rows can end up with mixed 0/3/6/8 after all steps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core rules like 777 replacement in odd rows and even row basing/overlays.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is solid (non-overlapping replaces); even row base init preserves zero positions; overlay uses both upper/lower correctly; segment capping applies 3s only where upper 6 present and adjacent to 0.
 * What didn't work: Border logic has hardcoded thresholds (left_min_k <=5, right dist<=4) which may not generalize—could be over-specific to training, leading to incorrect 3/8 choices in test if proximity rules differ; right border scan breaks at first upper 6 from right, but may miss if no 6 in segment; extension only for full non-zero rows, which might miss partial extensions.
 * Inward extension is limited to one position and only if exactly 3-8 adjacent—may not capture longer chains or different patterns.
 * Cap function skips bottom right caps entirely, which worked for training but could be a subtlety if test bottom row needs symmetric capping.
 * Overlay uses input g for lower row checks? No, it uses out[j+1], but since odd rows processed first, out[j+1] is updated if odd; for even j, lower is odd and already processed—correct, but if test has unprocessed lowers, issue (but code processes odds first).
 * No extraction functions for objects like segments or borders— all inline, which is helpful for direct transformation but harder to debug segments.
 * Function `overlay_sixes_from_adjacents` is helpful but note: it overlays on base without preserving prior 6s from base (but base is 0/8, so ok); `cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges` correctly identifies segments but only checks upper for 6s, ignoring input or lower—potential miss if puzzle requires broader checks.
 * Overall, program shows good structure (modular functions), but border proximity logic (min_k, dist) seems empirically tuned and may fail on test variations in 6 positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows? appears to be 18 even/odd pairs plus one, n=17) shows patterns like full 8-rows with 6 overlays, zero-separated segments capped with 3s, and border 3s extended in some non-bottom even rows (e.g., row 4: [3,8,8,...3] with left/right 3s, no inward extend visible as it has 0 inside).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows have 6s where 777 likely replaced (e.g., row 2: 6 at col 10, row 4: 6 at 13); even rows have 0s preserved, 6 overlays (e.g., row 1: 6 at 10 from above/below), 3 caps on segments near 0s with upper 6 (e.g., row 4 segment from col8-16 capped 3 at 8 and 16? but output has 3 at 0? wait, col0=3 but no left 0, likely border set).
 * Does not look fully correct: e.g., row 10 (even?): [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has 3 at col9 but segment seems col0-9 then 0 at10, then 11-16; if upper (row9) has 6 at col4, capping should apply left 3 at col0 if adjacent 0 (but left border), but right cap at col9=3 ok if upper 6 in segment and right 0; however, col0=3 suggests border set to 3 due to close upper 6 (min_k<=5), but expected might be 8 if farther—unknown if proximity threshold wrong, as output has unexpected 3 at col9 without clear right adjacency cap trigger.
 * Row 16 (even?): [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] looks like full row with 6s overlaid and borders 3—makes sense if no zeros and upper 6s trigger borders to 3, but if puzzle expects 8 borders without close 6s, this differs (e.g., 6s at col3,7,12 may set min_k/dist low enough for 3).
 * Row 17: [0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0] has isolated 8-6-8 segments, likely base 8 where input non-zero, overlaid 6—no 3 caps visible, correct if no upper 6 in those short segments or not adjacent to 0 in way that triggers (but they are isolated, so should cap if upper 6? wait, segments are non-zero flanked by 0, so if upper has 6 anywhere in seg, cap both ends to 3—but output has 8s at ends, so either no upper 6 in seg or cap logic missed; upper row16 has 6 at col3 (matches seg col2-4? col2=8,3=6,4=8 yes, so should cap left col2=3 and right col4=3 if not bottom—but output keeps 8s, so cap function broken for this: perhaps because overlay set 6 after base, but cap checks temp which has 6, but condition is segment_has_upper_6 which scans upper for 6 in start-end, yes should trigger—wait, discrepancy, cap likely applied but only if adjacent 0, which it is, so this indicates bug in cap or order).
 * Another difference: row 6 [3,3,8,...3,3] shows inward extension (3 at col1 and col15), correct if borders set to 3 and next is 8, no zeros; but if test expects no extension or different, it's over-applied.
 * Overall, test output follows program logic but likely incorrect in places like missing 3 caps on isolated segments with upper 6 (e.g., row17 segs should be [3,6,3] if upper 6 present, but are [8,6,8]—expected [3,6,3] per rules, so cap not triggering properly, perhaps because upper for row17 is row16 which has 6s, but code uses upper=out[j-1], yes; unknown why not capped, maybe segment detect skips if 6 already there? No, temp has 6 but non-zero. This suggests cap function is broken for segments containing 6s or short ones.
 * Borders in row 4: left 3 at col0, right 3 at col16, but middle 0 at col7—no extend across zero, correct; but if expected full borders without 3 if far from 6, differs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves processing a grid of integers (representing visual patterns like lines, borders, and fills) through rule-based transformations, alternating between "pattern rows" (odd indices, handling sequences like three 7s) and "frame rows" (even indices, incorporating overlays, adjacent modifications, borders, and extensions) to generate an output grid that likely renders a coherent visual structure, such as connected shapes or diagrams.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other row starting from 1) are processed for local patterns, specifically replacing sequences of three consecutive 7s with [8, 6, 8] to simulate some kind of bend or connection in the visual pattern.
 * Even rows (frame rows) start with a base overlay: copy non-zero values from input as 8s, and propagate 6s vertically from adjacent rows (above or below) to maintain continuity in vertical elements like stems or supports.
 * Adjacent 0-handling in frame rows: After a 0, if followed by a non-zero and there's a 6 above the first post-0 6, set the position right after 0 to 3 (perhaps a cap or endpoint); before a 0 (non-bottom rows), if preceded by non-zero and there's a 6 above the last pre-0 6, set the position right before 0 to 3— this seems to handle gaps or interruptions in lines.
 * Border 3-placement in frame rows: For left/right edges, if there's a 6 in the row and a 6 above it, prioritize setting edge to 3 if input has 3 or if the edge 8 is part of a segment containing that 6; otherwise, fall back to 8 if input edge is 3 but no matching 6 overlay—subtlety: segment detection (consecutive non-zeros) determines if the border connects to the 6, easy to miss without proper boundary traversal.
 * Extension rule for frame rows (non-bottom, no zeros, n>=2): If edge is 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward to replace the 8, simulating line extension or filling short segments.
 * Bottom row special casing: No pre-0 adjacent 3s, no extensions, to avoid over-processing at the grid's end.
 * Grid assumptions: Uniform width n across rows, non-empty grid; output preserves structure but modifies values (0=empty/gap, 3=endpoint/cap, 6=vertical connector, 8=horizontal fill/line).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical propagation of 6s ignores input zeros (overlays on empty spaces); segment checks for borders require forward/backward scans to find enclosing non-zero runs; no horizontal propagation beyond adjacents; process pattern rows first, then frames (order matters for overlays using updated rows).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure copies are deep (row.copy()) to avoid mutating input; handle edge cases like no 6s (left6_pos/right6_pos=-1), single-column grids (n<2 skips extensions), all-zero rows; potential over-setting of 3s if multiple conditions overlap—needs idempotence checks.

# Note: add_border_3s and add_extension are helpful but complex; add_border_3s has segment detection which is key for border connections, but its right-end scan logic has off-by-one risks (s +=1 after while). add_extension is simple and useful for non-gappy rows.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt provided; previous ones implied by context (e.g., evolutions leading to correct training handling) likely missed vertical 6 propagation or segment-based border logic, as those are intricate.
 * Worked: Correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid grasp of pattern replacement (7s to 8-6-8), vertical overlays, and basic adjacent/border modifications—core transformation pipeline is validated.
 * Didn't work: add_0_adjacent only scans until next 0 for nearest 6, potentially missing non-adjacent 6s in longer segments; border_3s fallback sets 8 on input 3 without overlay match, which might over-extend empties; no handling for overlapping 3/6/8 sets (e.g., if overlay sets 6 but adjacent sets 3).
 * add_extension skips if any 0 present, which works for clean rows but may leave short 3-8 stubs unextended in gappy frames.
 * No extraction functions like object detection (e.g., finding connected components of 8s/6s) were used; this attempt is purely rule-based per row, which succeeds on trainings but may not scale to complex shapes without holistic grid analysis.
 * process_pattern is robust and skips non-matches correctly (i +=1), essential for partial patterns.
 * Trainings passed fully, but subtle: if trainings had no gaps or borders, they wouldn't stress-test 0-adjacent or border segment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows x 17 cols) shows consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even/frame) has 8s with a 6 at col 10, likely from overlay; row 1 (odd/pattern) has 0s interrupted by 8-6-8 at cols 9-11, suggesting no 7-patterns or gap handling; row 2 has 3s at edges, 8s, 6 at col 10 and 13, with 8s connecting—looks like frame with hooks.
 * Overall, it makes sense visually as a structured diagram: alternating filled frames (8-heavy even rows with 6 hooks) and sparse patterns (odd rows with 0 gaps and 8-6-8 inserts); bottom rows show extensions like 3 at edges (row 18: starts/ends with 3, has 0 gap mid with 3 cap).
 * Does not look fully correct in isolation (no input grid provided for verification, but mentally simulating rules): e.g., row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has isolated 3 after 0 (col 8), which add_0_adjacent might intend, but if upper row (row 3 all 0s?) has no 6 above that position, it shouldn't set 3—possible over-setting; row 9 [0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has 8-6-8 isolated, good for pattern, but if from overlay, lower propagation (from row 10?) might conflict if row 10 has no matching 6.
 * Missing potential: No evident horizontal extension across gaps in some rows (e.g., row 7 has isolated 8-6-8 mid-0s, but if input had connecting 8s, they should overlay as 8s—suspect input had 0s there); borders inconsistently 3 vs 8 (e.g., row 0 all 8s no edge 3, but row 2 starts with 3s—depends on input edges and upper 6s).
 * Looks mostly correct for a test (trainings passed imply rules align), but subtle differences: row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] has multiple 6s without adjacent 0-handling visible, expected if no gaps; however, row 17's 0s with 8-6-8 inserts seem correct, but final row 18 has 0 mid (col 7) capped by 3, which add_0_adjacent should handle only if post-0 has 6 above—unknown if upper (row 17) aligns, but appears consistent; if incorrect, likely due to incomplete scan in add_0_adjacent missing distant 6s.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing graphical or shape-based patterns) using specific rules to process even and odd rows differently, overlay connections (like 6s), handle borders and zeros with 3s, and apply pattern replacements (e.g., 777 to 868), resulting in a modified output grid that simulates visual rendering or object connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Even rows (index 0,2,...) start with an overlay of 8s where input is non-zero, then add 6s vertically aligned under/above 6s in adjacent odd rows; adjacent 0s in even rows get 3s on edges of non-zero segments if there's an upper 6 nearby; borders (left/right) in even rows get 3s or 8s based on proximity to upper 6s (with distance thresholds like <=5 for left, <=4 for right) and input values, but top row always uses 8s on borders; extensions propagate 3s inward if followed by 8s, but only if no zeros and not bottom row.
 * Odd rows (index 1,3,...) are processed by scanning for consecutive 777 patterns and replacing with 868, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlaps.
 * Subtleties: Vertical 6 overlays ignore self-row values but check adjacent rows; 3s on borders consider segment extents and min/max k positions for 6s (e.g., left uses min k <=5, right uses distance <=4); bottom row skips some extensions and border adjustments; zeros in even rows can create isolated segments needing 3s only if upper-connected; input 3s on borders influence fallbacks; no processing if empty grid; assumes uniform column width n.
 * Easy-to-miss: Pattern replacement in odd rows is while-loop based with i+=3 skip, so it handles non-overlapping triples only; border logic for left/right scans segment length but applies conditions asymmetrically (left min_k <=5, right dist<=4, possibly puzzle-specific asymmetry); add_0_adjacent only adds 3s to segment starts/ends adjacent to 0s if upper 6 present, and skips bottom row's right extension; has_zero check prevents extensions on full non-zero rows; is_top always forces border 8s regardless of other conditions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handles training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, pattern replacement in odds, and 6-overlay/3-border logic in evens.
 * What worked: Odd row 777->868 replacement is precise and non-overlapping; even row initialization with 8s and vertical 6 propagation captures connections; segment-based 3 additions for zeros and borders with upper-6 checks align with visual linking; extensions handle edge propagation without overextending.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential subtleties like asymmetric border distances (5 vs 4) might be puzzle-specific and untested; the program assumes uniform n and no row-length variations; add_extension skips if any zero present, which might miss partial extensions in dense rows.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/segment extractors beyond internal use in add_0_adjacent); the code is procedural without higher-level abstractions like object detection, which might help for debugging visuals but isn't needed for core transformation.
 * Function `get_6_overlay` helpfully uses both upper and lower for 6s, but lower check (out[j+1]) assumes odd rows are already processed—order matters as evens are done after odds.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions noted; all provided are integrated and functional for the rules, though border logic is complex and could be error-prone for asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, 17 columns) shows alternating even/odd processing: odd rows have 868 patterns and isolated 6s/8s (e.g., row 1: mostly 0s with 8,6,8 in middle); even rows have 8/6/3 overlays with borders like 3s on edges (e.g., row 4: 3,8s,6,8,8,3) and zero gaps filled selectively (e.g., row 0 has trailing 6,8 after 8s).
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: 6s align vertically (e.g., column 10 has 6s in odds propagating to evens); 3s appear on borders/edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 left/right 3s near upper 6 in row 3); patterns like 777 aren't visible in input but replacements show in odds; extensions visible (e.g., row 6: 3,3,8s...3,3); zeros in evens create segments with 3 caps where connected.
 * Minor oddities: Some even rows have unexpected 0s persisting (e.g., row 17 has scattered 0s around 6,8), which might be correct if input had zeros not overlaid, but could differ if expected full coverage—unclear without expected output, but rules allow 0s where input is 0 and no overlay; bottom row (18?) has 3s and 6s as per is_bottom skips; overall, it makes sense and demonstrates rule application without obvious breaks, though border 3 placements (e.g., row 10 right 3) might need verifying against exact upper 6 positions/distances.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids (likely representing patterns like shapes or symbols with numbers 0,3,6,7,8) are processed row-by-row according to rules that replace patterns (e.g., three 7s), overlay values like 6s from adjacent rows, insert 3s adjacent to 0s based on upper-row conditions, handle borders specially (favoring 3 or 8 based on proximity to 6s or top/bottom status), and extend certain patterns. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually "renders" or modifies the input to match some stylized or rule-based visual effect, possibly simulating shading, borders, or object outlines in a puzzle like a figure-drawing or pattern-evolution task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,5,...) undergo pattern replacement: sequences of three consecutive 7s are replaced with 8,6,8, skipping ahead after replacement to avoid overlap issues.
 * Even rows (0-based indices 0,2,4,...) start with an overlay: positions are set to 8 if input is non-zero, else 0, then 6s are overlaid if the position directly above or below (if exists) has a 6 in the current output.
 * Adjacent 0 handling in even rows: Identify non-zero segments; if a segment has a 6 in the upper row (if exists), add 3s to the left/right edges of the segment if they border a 0 (but only left for left borders, and right only if not bottom row).
 * Border-specific rules for even rows: Left border (first non-zero position) sets to 8 if top row; else to 3 if upper row has a 6 nearby (within segment, with min_k <=5 for left) or input was 3, otherwise 8; similar for right border but with max_k and distance <=4 for 3 vs 8. Bottom rows treat borders more leniently toward 3s.
 * Extension rule for even non-bottom rows without 0s: If n>=2 and starts/ends with 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward (change the 8 to 3).
 * Subtleties: Rules depend on row parity, top/bottom status, and adjacency (upper only for most checks, no lower for borders); 6s propagate vertically but only checked in overlays; 0s act as "gaps" that trigger 3 insertions only if upper has 6s in the segment; borders have asymmetric distance thresholds (left <=5, right <=4); input 3s influence borders if no upper 6; process odd rows first, then even; assume all rows same length n, no empty grids.
 * Easy-to-miss: i +=3 skip in pattern replacement to handle non-overlapping; segment finding ignores isolated 0s; no horizontal propagation of 3s beyond edges; extensions only if no 0s in row and not bottom; potential for multiple passes or order sensitivity (odd first, then even).
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Early versions might miss border distance calcs or extension, leading to wrong 8/3 on edges; 0-adjacent only triggers on upper 6s per segment, not per cell; overlays use current out, so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both, indicating solid grasp of core row processing, pattern replacement, and basic overlay/adjacent rules.
 * What worked: Odd-row 777->868 replacement is accurate and non-overlapping; 6 overlays propagate vertically correctly; 0-adjacent 3 insertions trigger properly on upper 6s per segment; border logic partially works for top/bottom and input-influenced 3s.
 * What didn't work: Border distance thresholds (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be imprecise or over-specific, potentially causing wrong 3/8 on edges in complex cases; extension only applies if no 0s and not bottom, but might miss cases where partial extensions are needed; no handling for if n<2 in extensions (though checked); lower-row 6s in overlay might interfere if odd rows processed first but lowers not fully updated yet.
 * add_border_3s is helpful but subtle bugs: left_min_k init to inf and min update; right scans backward for max_k but breaks early—could miss if multiple 6s; input 3 only fallback if no upper 6.
 * add_extension is simple but only inward on 3-8 pairs, might not handle longer chains or reverse (8-3).
 * No extraction functions like for "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) were used or needed; the puzzle is rule-based transformation, not object detection, so no need for such (unhelpful for this problem).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding but borders and extensions may need tuning for edge cases like the test.

 * The generated test output is a 19-row grid (last row incomplete in listing but appears 17 cols like others) with alternating even/odd patterns: even rows mostly 8s with 6s in specific columns (e.g., col 10-11 often 6,8; col 13-14 sometimes 6,8), 3s at left/right borders in some (e.g., row 4: 3...3), and 0s filling gaps; odd rows have more 0s with isolated 8,6,8 segments and border 3s.
 * It makes sense structurally: Consistent with rules, e.g., 6s align vertically (like col 10 has 6s in multiple even rows, suggesting upper/lower propagation); 3s appear at borders or next to 0s (e.g., row 4 ends with 6,8,8,3 next to implied 0s); extensions visible in full-8 rows turning to 3,8 or similar; no obvious anomalies like stray 7s (processed away) or mismatched parities.
 * However, without the test input grid, can't fully verify correctness, but it looks correct based on rule application—patterns like repeated [0,0,0,...8,6,8,0,...] in odd rows suggest processed 777s, and even rows have overlayed 6s without over-inserting 3s everywhere. If incorrect, likely subtle border misplacement (e.g., a 8 where 3 expected due to distance >4/5) or missed extension in a no-zero row; observed effects include heavy 0s in odds (gaps) and 3-borders in evens, differing from pure 8-fills if borders were mishandled, but no clear errors visible—assume matches expected unless input shows otherwise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of a grid of integers (primarily 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) where odd-indexed rows undergo pattern replacement (e.g., sequences of 7s become specific patterns like 868), and even-indexed rows are rebuilt based on input non-zeros, vertical propagation of 6s from adjacent rows, edge capping with 3s under conditions like adjacency to 0s or proximity to upper 6s, and border handling with asymmetric rules for top/bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed first and independently: non-overlapping sequences of exactly three 7s are replaced with [8, 6, 8], but longer or shorter sequences of 7s remain unchanged; no other transformations apply to odd rows.
 * Even rows start with a base layer of 8s where the input is non-zero (0 elsewhere), then overlay 6s vertically from any adjacent row (upper or lower) that has a 6 in the same column, prioritizing 6 over 8.
 * For even rows, identify non-zero segments and cap edges with 3 if adjacent to a 0 and the segment has at least one 6 directly above it in the upper row (if exists); this does not apply to the right edge of the bottom row.
 * Border rules for even rows are position-specific and asymmetric: left border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within the first ~5 positions of the left segment or if input is 3 (top row forces 8); right border sets to 3 if upper row has a 6 within ~4 positions from the right or input is 3 (skips for non-bottom if dist >4); bottom row is more permissive for 3s.
 * If an even row (non-bottom) has no 0s and edges are 3 followed by 8, extend the 3 inward by one position to "thicken" borders.
 * Processing order matters: odd rows first (all at once), then even rows top-to-bottom (since overlays depend on already-processed adjacent rows); input g is preserved for base initialization but out is mutated.
 * Subtleties include: no horizontal propagation in even rows (only vertical for 6s); segments for 3-capping are contiguous non-zeros; proximity for borders uses min/max k distances but with hardcoded thresholds (5 left, 4 right); top row ignores upper/lower for some rules and forces 8s on borders; bottom row skips right-edge 3-capping and is more aggressive on borders; empty or short rows (<3) skip replacements.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overlays check processed out (not raw g) for adjacent 6s, ensuring propagation; input 3s influence borders even without upper 6s; no changes to 0s except as delimiters; rules don't apply to odd rows beyond 777 replacement.

(The border-setting and inward-extension functions from the attempt are helpful but overly complex due to hardcoded distances; simplify proximity checks in future. No types or object-extraction tools are needed, as this is rule-based grid transformation, not object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row 777 replacement as non-overlapping and skips short rows.
 * Successfully processes even rows in order: base 8s from input non-zeros, vertical 6 overlays from processed adjacent rows, segment-based 3 capping at 0-edges if upper 6 present.
 * Border rules capture input 3 influence and top-row forcing to 8, but proximity thresholds (left <=5, right <=4) are ad-hoc and may overfit; bottom row permissiveness works for training.
 * Inward 3 extension correctly conditions on no 0s, non-bottom, and 3-8 edge pattern.
 * Training example 1 and 2 passed fully, demonstrating core understanding of vertical propagation, segment capping, and border asymmetry.
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; rules are positional/segment-based, not blob-oriented.
 * The main program composes functions correctly (odds first, evens sequentially), avoiding mutation issues by using temp vars.
 * Subtle miss: right border proximity scans from right but breaks early; could be more efficient but works.
 * Function `set_border_threes_based_on_upper_six_proximity_and_input` is helpful but convoluted—segment finding is duplicated from capping; merge in future to avoid redundancy.
 * Function `initialize_even_row_with_nonzero_to_eight` is essential and correct for base layer.
 * Function `extend_three_inward_at_edges_if_no_zeros` handles continuous rows well but skips if any 0 present, matching observed "thickening" only for full-width segments.
 * No unhelpful functions; all contribute, though border function could be broken down (e.g., separate left/right logic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns) with consistent application of rules: e.g., row 0 (even, top) has 8s and a 6 overlay around col 10-11; row 1 (odd) has isolated 8-6-8 and 8-6-8 patterns amid 0s; even rows like row 4 have 3-8...3 capping segments with upper 6s and 0 adjacencies.
 * Patterns look correct and consistent: vertical 6s align (e.g., col 7-8 has 6s propagating down); borders show 3s on bottom-ish rows (e.g., row 16 has left/right 3s extended inward in row 12? Wait, row 12 is even with 3-3...3-3, suggesting full-width no-0 extension); 0s preserved as gaps.
 * It matches expected behavior mentally: for test input (inferred from base 8s and overlays), odd rows likely had 777s replaced (e.g., row 2's 8-8-...-6-8-8-6-8... suggests two 868 from 777s); even rows cap with 3s where upper 6 and 0-adjacent (e.g., row 4's 3 at col0,8,16 next to 0s under 6s in row 3).
 * No obvious mismatches; looks correct overall—symmetric patterns in upper/lower halves suggest the test input had mirrored structures, and rules preserved that without artifacts like uncapped edges or misplaced 6s.
 * Minor note: row 10 (even) has 3 at col9 and col16 but 0 at col10—capping applied correctly to segments without propagating over 0s; this is as expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like walls, paths, or patterns in a grid-based image) by applying row-specific rules: odd rows undergo pattern replacements, while even rows are initialized, overlaid, capped, and bordered according to adjacency and conditions involving 6s and 0s. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually matches an expected pattern, such as a stylized drawing or maze, by simulating rules that create borders (3s), paths (6s), fills (8s), and empties (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows: Non-overlapping sequences of [7,7,7] must be replaced with [8,6,8] to create "bridges" or paths; this is processed first and independently for all odd rows.
 * Even rows: Start with a base of 8 for non-zero input cells and 0 for zeros; then overlay 6s in positions where the upper or lower row (odd) has a 6 in the same column, simulating vertical continuity.
 * Segment capping in even rows: For non-zero segments adjacent to 0s, cap the left/right edges with 3 if the segment has an upper 6 anywhere in it; skip right cap on bottom row; this creates "guarded" edges but only for segments influenced by upper 6s.
 * Border handling in even rows: Left and right edges are set to 3 or 8 based on proximity to upper 6s (e.g., if a 6 is within ~5 positions on left or ~4 on right, use 3; otherwise 8), input values (prefer 3 if input is 3), and row position (top rows default to 8, bottom may force 3); this is separate from segment capping and focuses on the grid's outer borders.
 * Inward extension: In non-bottom even rows without zeros, extend border 3s inward by one position if followed by an 8, to "thicken" borders subtly.
 * Global considerations: Process odd rows fully before even rows; even rows are done top-to-bottom, relying on already-processed odd rows above; handle edge cases like single-row grids, zero-length rows, top/bottom status, and varying segment lengths; subtle misses include incorrect proximity distances (e.g., left uses <=5, right <=4), not skipping right caps only on bottom, or failing to check for upper 6s per segment/border.
 * Input assumptions: Grid has uniform width n, rows alternate even/odd starting at 0; numbers include 0 (empty), 3 (border), 6 (path), 7 (pre-replacement), 8 (fill); no overlapping replacements or backward passes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Borders check min/max k for 6 proximity differently on left/right; extensions only if no zeros and n>=2; overlays use already-processed adjacent rows, so order matters; caps and borders can interact (e.g., a border 3 might be overwritten or extended).

(The above functions are helpful for core transformations; others like set_left_border_three, set_right_border_three, and extend_border_threes_inward are also useful but overly specific to proximity logic, which may need tuning; initialize_even_row_base is simple and correct but basic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of odd-row replacements, even-row basing, 6 overlays, and basic capping/bordering.
 * Worked well: Pattern replacement in odd rows is non-overlapping and forward-only, avoiding infinite loops; overlays correctly propagate 6s vertically using processed adjacent rows.
 * Did not work fully: Border proximity logic (e.g., left_min_k <=5, right dist <=4) may be arbitrary or incorrect for some cases, as it hardcodes distances that might not generalize; right border search starts from end but breaks on first 6, potentially missing closer ones if not reversed properly.
 * Capping skips right edges only on bottom, which is good, but may overcap if segments overlap with borders; extensions only apply if no zeros, which prevents artifacts but might miss partial fills.
 * Function set_left_border_three and set_right_border_three are helpful but complex and potentially buggy in min/max k calculations (e.g., right_max_k init to -1, loop direction); they handle top/bottom and input_3 fallbacks correctly.
 * Function cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges correctly identifies segments and checks upper 6s per segment, but doesn't handle if upper row isn't processed yet (though main program orders it right).
 * Function extend_border_threes_inward is subtle and mostly correct but skips if any zero exists, which could prevent needed extensions in mixed rows.
 * Overall, the main program structure (odd first, then even top-to-bottom) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but earlier attempts (implied) might have missed order or proximity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a coherent 18-row grid (9 even, 9 odd) with consistent patterns: odd rows have isolated [8,6,8] amid 0s, even rows have fills of 8s interrupted by 6s and bordered by 3s, creating vertical alignments (e.g., 6s stacking across rows).
 * It looks mostly correct and sensible: Overlays propagate 6s properly (e.g., row 1's 6 at col 10 aligns with row 0's 6 there; row 3's [8,6,8] at cols 12-14 influences row 2 and 4); borders use 3s at edges where upper 6s are proximal (e.g., row 4 ends with 3, row 6 has 3s at both ends extended inward).
 * Potential issues: Row 4 has a 3 at col 0, 8s, a 0 at col 7, then 3 at col 8, suggesting capping worked but the inner 3 might be from border logic overlapping a segment; row 10 has 3 at col 0, but a 0 at col 10 breaks continuity, and 3 at end—capping seems applied but extension skipped due to zero, which is correct per rules.
 * Row 16 (even) has 6s at cols 3,12 but no 3 caps visible around isolated 6s (since 6 overlays on base 8, not creating new segments adjacent to 0s); this matches rules as overlays don't trigger capping unless edges touch 0s with upper 6 condition.
 * Row 17 (odd) has scattered [8,6,8] and 0s, likely from input 7s replaced correctly; overall, the output visually forms connected paths/borders (e.g., vertical 6 channels at cols 7-8, 10-12), suggesting it makes sense for a puzzle like drawing outlines or mazes, but without expected output, can't confirm if border distances or specific 3 placements (e.g., row 11 all 0s, no influence) are exact—differences might be in unhandled input variations like non-7 patterns in odd rows.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:08:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where input grids with numbers (0,3,6,7,8) are transformed according to layered rules to produce an output grid, likely simulating visual patterns like borders, overlays, or motif resolutions in a cellular or rule-driven manner. The rules differentiate between even and odd rows, handling replacements, overlays, segment capping, and border adjustments to create coherent structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based indices 1,3,...) undergo replacement of any consecutive [7,7,7] with [8,6,8], but only if exactly three in a row; this is scanned sequentially without overlap handling.
 * Even rows start as a base of 8s where input is non-zero (0s remain 0), then overlay 6s directly below or above any 6 in adjacent odd rows.
 * For even rows, non-zero segments adjacent to 0s are capped with 3s on edges only if the upper row (if exists) has a 6 overlapping that segment; this prevents "dangling" segments but skips bottom row capping entirely.
 * Left and right borders of even rows are set to 3 or 8 based on: top row always 8; otherwise, 3 if upper has 6 nearby (within specific distances: left <=5 positions, right <=4 from edge), or if input was 3; else 8. This creates asymmetric border logic.
 * After border setting, extend 3s inward by one position if adjacent to 8 and not bottom row with zeros present, but only if no zeros in row and n>=2.
 * Subtleties: Upper row for even row 0 is all 0s (no overlay/capping); bottom even rows skip right capping and inward extension if zeros present; segment finding in capping assumes contiguous non-zeros; border checks scan for nearest 6 but use hardcoded distances (5 left, 4 right) which may miss wider patterns.
 * Easy to miss: Overlays happen before capping/borders, so 6s can influence segment detection; no downward influence from lower rows except for overlays; input 3s only affect borders if no upper 6; zeros block segment continuity but allow capping triggers via adjacency.
 * All rows copied initially, only odd rows modified first, then even rows overwritten; assumes uniform width n, rectangular grid.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle empty grids; avoid modifying odds after evens; precise i+=3 skipping in replacement to avoid partial overlaps; min_k/max_k for border proximity to detect "close" 6s; is_bottom flags prevent over-capping; has_zero check in extension to avoid filling empty-ish rows.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core rules for odd-row replacements, even-row base/overlay, and basic capping/borders work for simple cases.
 * Worked: Triple 7 replacement correctly introduces 6s in odds; overlays propagate 6s vertically; segment capping adds 3s where upper 6s justify borders.
 * Did not work fully: Border logic uses fixed distances (left min_k <=5, right dist <=4) which might under/over-apply 3s in wider test grids; inward extension skips too often if zeros present, potentially leaving isolated 8s.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this code builds on assumed earlier versions by adding is_bottom flags and upper_row defaults to all 0s, fixing edge row issues.
 * cap_zero_adjacent_segment_edges correctly identifies segments but misses if upper 6 is outside segment (only checks overlap); helpful for contiguous blocks but not for sparse 6s.
 * set_left_border and set_right_border handle top=8 and input_3 fallbacks well, but right border scans backward inefficiently and breaks on first 6 (max_k), which could miss farther influences.
 * extend_border_threes_inward is somewhat helpful for tightening borders but not essential if capping covers it; unhelpful in rows with any 0 as it does nothing.
 * Overall, program(g) structure is solid (copy input, process odds then evens), but lacks symmetry in left/right (dist 5 vs 4) and no lower-row influence beyond overlay.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid with patterned 8s (background/fill), 6s (overlays/motifs), 3s (caps/borders), and 0s (empties), creating symmetric-ish structures like vertical bands and isolated segments.
 * It makes partial sense: Odd rows have 868 patterns where 777 likely were; even rows have 8-bases with 6 overlays (e.g., column 10 has vertical 6s); 3s appear on segment edges near upper 6s (e.g., row 4 ends with 3s around 6); borders often 3 or 8 as per rules.
 * Does not look fully correct: Row 4 [3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3] has internal 3 at pos8 without clear upper 6 trigger (upper row3 is all 0s except end), suggesting over-capping; row 10 [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3] has 3s at borders but isolated 0 at pos10 breaks symmetry, possibly missing inward extension or wrong segment split.
 * Row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8] overlays 6s correctly but no 3 caps visible, expected if no adjacent 0s; however, row 18 [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] has 3s around a 0-internal segment, but the 0 at pos7 might need different handling (e.g., split segments uncapped).
 * Differences from expected: Expected more uniform border 3s propagating inward (e.g., row 6 [3,3,8,...3,3] shows extension, but row 12 [3,3,8,...3,3] mirrors it—good); but test has asymmetric 6 placements (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col14 not mirrored), possibly input-driven but code's right dist=4 might cap incorrectly vs left=5. Overall, patterns emerge but subtle mismatches in 3 placements near sparse 6s suggest border distances or segment overlap checks need adjustment; unknown if input has 777 or border 3s triggering extras.
