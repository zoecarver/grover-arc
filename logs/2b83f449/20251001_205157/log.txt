=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:51:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:58:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where input grids with numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) represent frames and content areas; the goal is to transform the grid by replacing patterns in content rows (odd indices) and adjusting frame rows (even indices) to draw borders with 3s, place 6s based on adjacent content, fill with 8s, and handle zeros/segments specially, likely simulating some kind of enclosed drawing or puzzle visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Content rows (odd indices) must scan for consecutive 7-7-7 patterns and replace them specifically with 8-6-8, skipping ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlaps; this seems to "draw" vertical elements or supports in content.
 * Frame rows (even indices) collect 6 positions from adjacent content rows (above and below) and place 6s there, but only if the frame cell isn't already non-zero (avoids overwriting).
 * Borders on upper frames use 3s conditionally: left/right edges get 3s if the first/last 6 from above is within 4 positions of the edge or if the row has any zero; this seems intended to extend borders inward but is over-triggering in attempts.
 * Closing 3s: For non-bottom frames, place a 3 left of any zero if the zero is after the max 6 position; this handles "gaps" but is applying too broadly, creating unwanted borders.
 * Bottom frame is special: Treat zeros as segment dividers, and for each segment (between zeros), place a left 3 only if it contains a 6; always place a rightmost 3; if no zeros, it's a single segment with left 3 only if it has a 6.
 * Zeros represent empty/unfilled areas that shouldn't extend frames; frames should be full 8s where no content influence, but attempts add 3s too aggressively, especially on edges without justification.
 * Subtlety: Frames don't always border on every edge—e.g., top frames may not need left/right 3s if content 6s are centered, and bottom handles segments to avoid over-bordering empty parts.
 * Has_zero flag in upper borders seems to force edge 3s if any zero exists, but this is too loose and causes mismatches (e.g., adding 3s where expected is 8).
 * Max_six for closing only applies after max 6, but in attempts, it leads to 3s in wrong places like mid-row.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal bordering: 3s only where needed to close/enclose 6-influenced areas, not blanket edges; 8s fill everything else in frames.
 * Easy to miss: No overwriting of existing non-zeros in frames; bottom segment logic must skip empty segments (start > end).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., w=19 in ex1, w=16 in ex2), so code must be width-agnostic; assume all rows same length.
 * Process content first, then frames top-to-bottom, but upper frames look at above content only for borders (below for 6s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import inf

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for replacing 7 patterns in content rows to create vertical 6 supports.)

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> set:
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```
(Useful for extracting 6 positions from content to propagate to frames.)

```python
def place_sixes(row: List[int], six_pos: set) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in six_pos:
        if 0 <= j < w and row[j] != 0:
            row[j] = 6
```
(Helpful for safely placing 6s in frames without overwriting non-zeros, but note: the condition row[j] != 0 might be too strict if frames start as 0s everywhere.)

The main program structure (copy grid, process odd rows first, then even rows with 6 propagation and border logic) is a good skeleton, but border/closing functions are flawed.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def handle_upper_frame_borders(out: List[List[int]], i: int, six_pos_above_first: int, six_pos_above_last: int, has_zero: bool) -> None:
    # ... (as in code)
```
(This is broken: over-places 3s on edges if has_zero is true anywhere in row, leading to extra borders; the <=4 condition doesn't align with examples where centered content leaves edges as 8.)

```python
def handle_closing_threes(row: List[int], six_pos: set, max_six: int) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in range(w):
        if row[j] == 0 and max_six <= j and j > 0:
            row[j - 1] = 3
```
(This is unhelpful/broken: applies closing 3s too early and without segment awareness, creating mid-frame borders where expected is continuous 8s; ignores right-side symmetry.)

```python
def handle_bottom_frame(out: List[int], i: int, six_pos: set) -> None:  # Note: param is List[int], should be List[List[int]]
    # ... (as in code)
```
(Broken: param type error (out is grid, but func takes List[int]); segment logic misses some cases like no left 3 for empty segments, and always adds right 3 even for empty full row; in ex1, it generates correct-ish bottom but with wrong left 3s in segments.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it partially succeeds: content row processing (7->8-6-8) appears correct in both trainings (e.g., 6s placed where expected in odd rows), and 6 propagation to frames works (matches 6 positions in evens).
 * What worked: Pattern replacement in content is accurate; collecting 6s from adjacent rows is right; bottom segment detection identifies zeros correctly in some cases (e.g., ex1 bottom has 8,8,0,3... matching expected start).
 * What didn't work: Frame borders over-place 3s, e.g., in train1 row0 (top frame), generated [3,8,...3] vs expected [8,8,...8]—no reason for edge 3s since content below starts 6s centered; similarly, row2 [3,3,8...] vs [3,3,8...] wait, actually row2 left 3s match but right ends with 3 vs 8.
 * Train1 mismatches: Row0 full edges 3s (wrong, should be 8s); row4 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row6 right [3,3] matches but left over-3? Wait, left [3,3] matches; row8 [3,8,...3] matches but internal 3 at pos15 wrong (expected no 3 there, it's 3,0,8,8,3 but generated has 3 before 0); row10 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row12 [8,8,0,3,...] matches expected [8,8,0,3,...].
 * Train2 mismatches: Row0 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row2 right [8,3] vs [8,8]; row4 [3,8,...3,3] vs [8,8,...3,3] (left 3 wrong); row6 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row8 [3,3,...3,3] matches; row10 [3,8,...3] vs expected [3,8,...3] wait, but expected ends 8,3? Wait, generated ends 8,3 matching, but left 3 might be extra.
 * General issue: has_zero forces too many edge 3s (e.g., any zero triggers full borders, but examples show edges stay 8 if content doesn't reach edges); closing_threes adds 3s after max_6 even in filled areas.
 * Bottom handling somewhat works but fails empty segments (e.g., adds left 3 where no 6).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs of 6s or enclosures) were attempted, but might be needed for better segment/border decisions—current code lacks holistic view of enclosed areas.
 * Attempts show understanding of alternating row types and 6 propagation, but miss subtlety that 3s are only for actual enclosure edges, not prophylactic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It has excessive 3s on frame edges and internals, e.g., row0 [3,8,...3] likely should be full 8s like train1 top (content below has 6s centered at pos10-11, not near edges); row2 [3,8,...3] probably wrong left 3 (content below sparse); row4 ends [3,3] but has internal 0 without proper closing; row6 [3,8,...3] vs likely [8,8,...8]; row10 [3,3,...3] has early left 3s and internal 3 before 0; row12 [3,8,...3] wrong edges; row14 [3,8,...3] wrong; row16 [3,8,...3] wrong; row18 [3,8,...0,3,...3] has 0 with 3 before but possibly wrong internal 3 at pos8.
 * Mentally simulating rules on test input (assuming similar to trains: input has 7s in odds replaced to 6s, frames start 0s): After content process, odds will have 6s at specific spots (e.g., row1 likely 6 at 10-11, row3 at 13-14, etc.); frames should propagate those 6s and add 3s only to enclose (e.g., left 3 only if 6 near left, no blanket edges); bottom row18 should segment on 0 at ~pos7 and pos? , adding 3s per has_6 but generated has extra 3 at pos8 and ends 3 correctly but left likely wrong. Overall, output looks over-bordered, missing continuous 8 fills where no enclosure needed—doesn't match inferred correct (more 8-heavy frames like train expects).

[2025-10-01 20:58:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 21:06:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing line segments, colors, or structural elements in a diagram like a floor plan or abstract pattern) that undergoes transformation rules to generate a new grid. The rules focus on detecting and modifying patterns in odd rows (e.g., sequences of 7s) and applying conditional overlays (e.g., 3s for edges or boundaries) to even rows based on adjacent "centers," zeros, and positional logic between upper/lower elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by identifying non-overlapping sequences of three consecutive 7s, replacing them with [8, 6, 8] to mark a "center" at the middle position; this skips over the triple to avoid overlap, but misses if 7s are isolated or in pairs.
 * Even rows start with a base layer: positions with 0 stay 0, centers from adjacent odd rows get 6, and all other non-zero positions get 8; this creates a foundational "fill" that gets overlaid.
 * Overlays for even rows vary by position: top rows have no overlays (pure base), bottom rows add 3s to the start of non-zero segments (if base is 8) and always to the end if 8; internal even rows use complex left/right placement logic based on the relative positions of min/max centers from upper and lower odd rows (e.g., place left 3 if no lower centers or if upper min < lower min), plus pre-pending 3 before zeros if adjacent base is 8, and boundary adjustments only if no zeros.
 * Subtle edge cases: Zeros in input rows block or trigger specific 3 placements (e.g., sides always get 3 if zeros present); segments in bottom overlays are contiguous non-zeros, and 3s only apply if the base is 8; centers are sets to handle multiples without overlap.
 * Global considerations: Grid dimensions (m rows, n cols) must be handled dynamically; assume even rows are 0,2,... and odd 1,3,...; no modifications to input zeros except in base; potential for multiple centers per row affecting adjacents; rules seem to simulate "structural supports" or "boundaries" around detected objects (7-triples as holes or features).
 * Easy-to-miss: The left/right placement in internal evens depends on comparative positions of entire center sets (min/max), not individual; if no upper/lower, defaults to full placement; bottom end always gets 3 if 8, regardless of segments; the i+=3 skip in odd processing ensures non-overlapping but may leave trailing 7s untouched if not in triples.
 * All attempts considered: No object extraction needed (rules are row-wise, not holistic); focus on adjacency between odd/even pairs; potential for visual alignment (e.g., 6 as vertical supports, 3/8 as horizontals, 0 as voids); test grids may have irregular zero placements or multiple centers requiring precise min/max logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set

def find_centers(row: List[int], n: int) -> Set[int]:
    """Extracts center positions (middle of every non-overlapping triple of 7s) in an odd row."""
    centers: Set[int] = set()
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        if row[i] == 7 and row[i + 1] == 7 and row[i + 2] == 7:
            centers.add(i + 1)
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return centers
```

```python
def process_odd_row(input_row: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Replaces non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8] in odd rows, leaving others intact."""
    new_row = input_row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + 2 < n and input_row[i] == 7 and input_row[i + 1] == 7 and input_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def compute_base_even(row_input: List[int], adj_centers: Set[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Creates base for even rows: 0 stays 0, adj centers get 6, others 8 if non-zero."""
    new_row = [0] * n
    for j in range(n):
        if row_input[j] == 0:
            new_row[j] = 0
        elif j in adj_centers:
            new_row[j] = 6
        else:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```

(The overlay functions like apply_internal_even_overlays, apply_bottom_overlays are helpful for specific row types but overly complex; simplify left/right logic if min/max comparisons fail edge cases. No types beyond List[List[int]] needed. No extraction functions for full objects, as rules are local to rows/adjacencies.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row processing (triple 7 detection and replacement) and base even row computation, as evidenced by both training examples passing.
 * Internal even row overlays work for simple cases (e.g., no zeros, single centers) but may mishandle complex min/max comparisons for left/right placement when multiple upper/lower centers overlap or are symmetric, potentially placing 3s incorrectly on boundaries.
 * Bottom row overlays correctly add 3s to segment starts and ends but might over-apply if segments are short (<3) or if zeros interrupt in ways that create unintended 8-to-3 changes before zeros (the pre-pend logic is in internal, not bottom, which could be a miss).
 * Top rows are correctly left as base (no overlays), which is simple and likely right.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core row-wise processing; however, the adj_centers union from upper/lower is essential but assumes centers are only in odd rows (correct per code).
 * The has_zero flag and pre-pending 3 before zeros (in internal) is a good subtlety but only applies if base left is 8, which might miss if zero is at edge.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and correct for non-overlapping triples; process_odd_row is solid but doesn't handle overlapping possibles (though puzzle likely doesn't have them).
 * apply_internal_even_overlays is helpful but convoluted—its place_left/place_right logic based on min/max could be broken for test cases with equal min/max (defaults to False, potentially no side 3s when needed).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though overlay apps could be merged for clarity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns), with visible patterns like repeated [8,8,...,6,8,...] in evens and [0,... ,6,8,...] in odds, plus 3s at edges/segments, which looks visually consistent with a structural overlay puzzle (e.g., 6s as supports under 7-triple centers, 3s as boundaries around voids/0s).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows show processed 6s where triples were, evens have bases with 6s at adj centers and 3s on sides/bottoms; for example, row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10, matching a likely 7-triple, and adjacent evens (rows 0/2) have 6 there with 8s elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots—e.g., row 4 (even, internal?) has 3s at cols 0,6,16 but a 0 at col7, suggesting pre-pend logic applied, but if this is bottom-like, the segment 3s might be over-applied (row 4: [3,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] ends with 3 at col16, but trailing 8s after 0 might need different handling); row 8 (even) has 3s at end [...,3,3] which seems like bottom rule but positionally odd if not bottom row.
 * Differences from expected: Without exact expected output, hard to confirm, but potential issues include extra 3s in internal rows (e.g., row 14: [8,... ,3,3] at end, possibly misplaced if not bottom) or missed 3s before zeros (e.g., row 17: [3,8,8,6,... ,0,3] has 0 at col6? Wait, listed as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,...]—the 0 at col7 followed by 3 at col8 suggests segment start 3, but if base was 8 before 0, why no pre-pend? This indicates the internal pre-pend logic might be broken or not triggered, differing from expected boundary reinforcement).
 * Another mismatch: Row 2 (even) has [3,3,8,... ,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] with leading 3s and internal 6s, but if adj centers are at cols 10 and 13?, the double 3 at start might be over-placement if has_zero=True (many 0s in input?); looks like it places left even with zeros, but expected might skip if lower centers dominate.
 * Overall, test output is plausible (80% match vibe) but likely incorrect in 2-3 rows due to left/right logic or zero-handling subtleties—e.g., row 16 (odd? Wait, output row16: [8,8,8,6,...] seems even-like, but indexing off); needs adjustment for comparative center positions in multi-center tests.

**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where input grids with numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) represent frames and content areas; the goal is to transform the grid by replacing patterns in content rows (odd indices) and adjusting frame rows (even indices) to draw borders with 3s, place 6s based on adjacent content, fill with 8s, and handle zeros/segments specially, likely simulating some kind of enclosed drawing or puzzle visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Content rows (odd indices) must scan for consecutive 7-7-7 patterns and replace them specifically with 8-6-8, skipping ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlaps; this seems to "draw" vertical elements or supports in content.
 * Frame rows (even indices) collect 6 positions from adjacent content rows (above and below) and place 6s there, but only if the frame cell isn't already non-zero (avoids overwriting).
 * Borders on upper frames use 3s conditionally: left/right edges get 3s if the first/last 6 from above is within 4 positions of the edge or if the row has any zero; this seems intended to extend borders inward but is over-triggering in attempts.
 * Closing 3s: For non-bottom frames, place a 3 left of any zero if the zero is after the max 6 position; this handles "gaps" but is applying too broadly, creating unwanted borders.
 * Bottom frame is special: Treat zeros as segment dividers, and for each segment (between zeros), place a left 3 only if it contains a 6; always place a rightmost 3; if no zeros, it's a single segment with left 3 only if it has a 6.
 * Zeros represent empty/unfilled areas that shouldn't extend frames; frames should be full 8s where no content influence, but attempts add 3s too aggressively, especially on edges without justification.
 * Subtlety: Frames don't always border on every edge—e.g., top frames may not need left/right 3s if content 6s are centered, and bottom handles segments to avoid over-bordering empty parts.
 * Has_zero flag in upper borders seems to force edge 3s if any zero exists, but this is too loose and causes mismatches (e.g., adding 3s where expected is 8).
 * Max_six for closing only applies after max 6, but in attempts, it leads to 3s in wrong places like mid-row.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal bordering: 3s only where needed to close/enclose 6-influenced areas, not blanket edges; 8s fill everything else in frames.
 * Easy to miss: No overwriting of existing non-zeros in frames; bottom segment logic must skip empty segments (start > end).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., w=19 in ex1, w=16 in ex2), so code must be width-agnostic; assume all rows same length.
 * Process content first, then frames top-to-bottom, but upper frames look at above content only for borders (below for 6s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import inf

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for replacing 7 patterns in content rows to create vertical 6 supports.)

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> set:
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```
(Useful for extracting 6 positions from content to propagate to frames.)

```python
def place_sixes(row: List[int], six_pos: set) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in six_pos:
        if 0 <= j < w and row[j] != 0:
            row[j] = 6
```
(Helpful for safely placing 6s in frames without overwriting non-zeros, but note: the condition row[j] != 0 might be too strict if frames start as 0s everywhere.)

The main program structure (copy grid, process odd rows first, then even rows with 6 propagation and border logic) is a good skeleton, but border/closing functions are flawed.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def handle_upper_frame_borders(out: List[List[int]], i: int, six_pos_above_first: int, six_pos_above_last: int, has_zero: bool) -> None:
    # ... (as in code)
```
(This is broken: over-places 3s on edges if has_zero is true anywhere in row, leading to extra borders; the <=4 condition doesn't align with examples where centered content leaves edges as 8.)

```python
def handle_closing_threes(row: List[int], six_pos: set, max_six: int) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in range(w):
        if row[j] == 0 and max_six <= j and j > 0:
            row[j - 1] = 3
```
(This is unhelpful/broken: applies closing 3s too early and without segment awareness, creating mid-frame borders where expected is continuous 8s; ignores right-side symmetry.)

```python
def handle_bottom_frame(out: List[int], i: int, six_pos: set) -> None:  # Note: param is List[int], should be List[List[int]]
    # ... (as in code)
```
(Broken: param type error (out is grid, but func takes List[int]); segment logic misses some cases like no left 3 for empty segments, and always adds right 3 even for empty full row; in ex1, it generates correct-ish bottom but with wrong left 3s in segments.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it partially succeeds: content row processing (7->8-6-8) appears correct in both trainings (e.g., 6s placed where expected in odd rows), and 6 propagation to frames works (matches 6 positions in evens).
 * What worked: Pattern replacement in content is accurate; collecting 6s from adjacent rows is right; bottom segment detection identifies zeros correctly in some cases (e.g., ex1 bottom has 8,8,0,3... matching expected start).
 * What didn't work: Frame borders over-place 3s, e.g., in train1 row0 (top frame), generated [3,8,...3] vs expected [8,8,...8]—no reason for edge 3s since content below starts 6s centered; similarly, row2 [3,3,8...] vs [3,3,8...] wait, actually row2 left 3s match but right ends with 3 vs 8.
 * Train1 mismatches: Row0 full edges 3s (wrong, should be 8s); row4 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row6 right [3,3] matches but left over-3? Wait, left [3,3] matches; row8 [3,8,...3] matches but internal 3 at pos15 wrong (expected no 3 there, it's 3,0,8,8,3 but generated has 3 before 0); row10 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row12 [8,8,0,3,...] matches expected [8,8,0,3,...].
 * Train2 mismatches: Row0 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row2 right [8,3] vs [8,8]; row4 [3,8,...3,3] vs [8,8,...3,3] (left 3 wrong); row6 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row8 [3,3,...3,3] matches; row10 [3,8,...3] vs expected [3,8,...3] wait, but expected ends 8,3? Wait, generated ends 8,3 matching, but left 3 might be extra.
 * General issue: has_zero forces too many edge 3s (e.g., any zero triggers full borders, but examples show edges stay 8 if content doesn't reach edges); closing_threes adds 3s after max_6 even in filled areas.
 * Bottom handling somewhat works but fails empty segments (e.g., adds left 3 where no 6).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs of 6s or enclosures) were attempted, but might be needed for better segment/border decisions—current code lacks holistic view of enclosed areas.
 * Attempts show understanding of alternating row types and 6 propagation, but miss subtlety that 3s are only for actual enclosure edges, not prophylactic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It has excessive 3s on frame edges and internals, e.g., row0 [3,8,...3] likely should be full 8s like train1 top (content below has 6s centered at pos10-11, not near edges); row2 [3,8,...3] probably wrong left 3 (content below sparse); row4 ends [3,3] but has internal 0 without proper closing; row6 [3,8,...3] vs likely [8,8,...8]; row10 [3,3,...3] has early left 3s and internal 3 before 0; row12 [3,8,...3] wrong edges; row14 [3,8,...3] wrong; row16 [3,8,...3] wrong; row18 [3,8,...0,3,...3] has 0 with 3 before but possibly wrong internal 3 at pos8.
 * Mentally simulating rules on test input (assuming similar to trains: input has 7s in odds replaced to 6s, frames start 0s): After content process, odds will have 6s at specific spots (e.g., row1 likely 6 at 10-11, row3 at 13-14, etc.); frames should propagate those 6s and add 3s only to enclose (e.g., left 3 only if 6 near left, no blanket edges); bottom row18 should segment on 0 at ~pos7 and pos? , adding 3s per has_6 but generated has extra 3 at pos8 and ends 3 correctly but left likely wrong. Overall, output looks over-bordered, missing continuous 8 fills where no enclosure needed—doesn't match inferred correct (more 8-heavy frames like train expects).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing line segments, colors, or structural elements in a diagram like a floor plan or abstract pattern) that undergoes transformation rules to generate a new grid. The rules focus on detecting and modifying patterns in odd rows (e.g., sequences of 7s) and applying conditional overlays (e.g., 3s for edges or boundaries) to even rows based on adjacent "centers," zeros, and positional logic between upper/lower elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by identifying non-overlapping sequences of three consecutive 7s, replacing them with [8, 6, 8] to mark a "center" at the middle position; this skips over the triple to avoid overlap, but misses if 7s are isolated or in pairs.
 * Even rows start with a base layer: positions with 0 stay 0, centers from adjacent odd rows get 6, and all other non-zero positions get 8; this creates a foundational "fill" that gets overlaid.
 * Overlays for even rows vary by position: top rows have no overlays (pure base), bottom rows add 3s to the start of non-zero segments (if base is 8) and always to the end if 8; internal even rows use complex left/right placement logic based on the relative positions of min/max centers from upper and lower odd rows (e.g., place left 3 if no lower centers or if upper min < lower min), plus pre-pending 3 before zeros if adjacent base is 8, and boundary adjustments only if no zeros.
 * Subtle edge cases: Zeros in input rows block or trigger specific 3 placements (e.g., sides always get 3 if zeros present); segments in bottom overlays are contiguous non-zeros, and 3s only apply if the base is 8; centers are sets to handle multiples without overlap.
 * Global considerations: Grid dimensions (m rows, n cols) must be handled dynamically; assume even rows are 0,2,... and odd 1,3,...; no modifications to input zeros except in base; potential for multiple centers per row affecting adjacents; rules seem to simulate "structural supports" or "boundaries" around detected objects (7-triples as holes or features).
 * Easy-to-miss: The left/right placement in internal evens depends on comparative positions of entire center sets (min/max), not individual; if no upper/lower, defaults to full placement; bottom end always gets 3 if 8, regardless of segments; the i+=3 skip in odd processing ensures non-overlapping but may leave trailing 7s untouched if not in triples.
 * All attempts considered: No object extraction needed (rules are row-wise, not holistic); focus on adjacency between odd/even pairs; potential for visual alignment (e.g., 6 as vertical supports, 3/8 as horizontals, 0 as voids); test grids may have irregular zero placements or multiple centers requiring precise min/max logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set

def find_centers(row: List[int], n: int) -> Set[int]:
    """Extracts center positions (middle of every non-overlapping triple of 7s) in an odd row."""
    centers: Set[int] = set()
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        if row[i] == 7 and row[i + 1] == 7 and row[i + 2] == 7:
            centers.add(i + 1)
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return centers
```

```python
def process_odd_row(input_row: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Replaces non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8] in odd rows, leaving others intact."""
    new_row = input_row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + 2 < n and input_row[i] == 7 and input_row[i + 1] == 7 and input_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def compute_base_even(row_input: List[int], adj_centers: Set[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Creates base for even rows: 0 stays 0, adj centers get 6, others 8 if non-zero."""
    new_row = [0] * n
    for j in range(n):
        if row_input[j] == 0:
            new_row[j] = 0
        elif j in adj_centers:
            new_row[j] = 6
        else:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```

(The overlay functions like apply_internal_even_overlays, apply_bottom_overlays are helpful for specific row types but overly complex; simplify left/right logic if min/max comparisons fail edge cases. No types beyond List[List[int]] needed. No extraction functions for full objects, as rules are local to rows/adjacencies.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row processing (triple 7 detection and replacement) and base even row computation, as evidenced by both training examples passing.
 * Internal even row overlays work for simple cases (e.g., no zeros, single centers) but may mishandle complex min/max comparisons for left/right placement when multiple upper/lower centers overlap or are symmetric, potentially placing 3s incorrectly on boundaries.
 * Bottom row overlays correctly add 3s to segment starts and ends but might over-apply if segments are short (<3) or if zeros interrupt in ways that create unintended 8-to-3 changes before zeros (the pre-pend logic is in internal, not bottom, which could be a miss).
 * Top rows are correctly left as base (no overlays), which is simple and likely right.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core row-wise processing; however, the adj_centers union from upper/lower is essential but assumes centers are only in odd rows (correct per code).
 * The has_zero flag and pre-pending 3 before zeros (in internal) is a good subtlety but only applies if base left is 8, which might miss if zero is at edge.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and correct for non-overlapping triples; process_odd_row is solid but doesn't handle overlapping possibles (though puzzle likely doesn't have them).
 * apply_internal_even_overlays is helpful but convoluted—its place_left/place_right logic based on min/max could be broken for test cases with equal min/max (defaults to False, potentially no side 3s when needed).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though overlay apps could be merged for clarity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns), with visible patterns like repeated [8,8,...,6,8,...] in evens and [0,... ,6,8,...] in odds, plus 3s at edges/segments, which looks visually consistent with a structural overlay puzzle (e.g., 6s as supports under 7-triple centers, 3s as boundaries around voids/0s).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows show processed 6s where triples were, evens have bases with 6s at adj centers and 3s on sides/bottoms; for example, row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10, matching a likely 7-triple, and adjacent evens (rows 0/2) have 6 there with 8s elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots—e.g., row 4 (even, internal?) has 3s at cols 0,6,16 but a 0 at col7, suggesting pre-pend logic applied, but if this is bottom-like, the segment 3s might be over-applied (row 4: [3,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] ends with 3 at col16, but trailing 8s after 0 might need different handling); row 8 (even) has 3s at end [...,3,3] which seems like bottom rule but positionally odd if not bottom row.
 * Differences from expected: Without exact expected output, hard to confirm, but potential issues include extra 3s in internal rows (e.g., row 14: [8,... ,3,3] at end, possibly misplaced if not bottom) or missed 3s before zeros (e.g., row 17: [3,8,8,6,... ,0,3] has 0 at col6? Wait, listed as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,...]—the 0 at col7 followed by 3 at col8 suggests segment start 3, but if base was 8 before 0, why no pre-pend? This indicates the internal pre-pend logic might be broken or not triggered, differing from expected boundary reinforcement).
 * Another mismatch: Row 2 (even) has [3,3,8,... ,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] with leading 3s and internal 6s, but if adj centers are at cols 10 and 13?, the double 3 at start might be over-placement if has_zero=True (many 0s in input?); looks like it places left even with zeros, but expected might skip if lower centers dominate.
 * Overall, test output is plausible (80% match vibe) but likely incorrect in 2-3 rows due to left/right logic or zero-handling subtleties—e.g., row 16 (odd? Wait, output row16: [8,8,8,6,...] seems even-like, but indexing off); needs adjustment for comparative center positions in multi-center tests.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

[2025-10-01 21:12:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines, fills, or shapes in a diagram) where rules transform input patterns, particularly propagating "6" markers vertically and horizontally while modifying edges with "3"s and handling special sequences like three consecutive "7"s in odd rows to create asymmetric or directional effects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content rows) are processed by scanning for sequences of three consecutive 7s and replacing them with [8, 6, 8], which introduces a "6" marker in the middle; this skips ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-7 sequences just increment by 1.
 * Even rows start by converting non-zero cells to 8 (like a base fill), then override positions directly above or below a 6 (from adjacent odd rows) to 6, creating vertical propagation of "6" influences.
 * In even rows, after base filling, identify segments of zeros (empty gaps) and add "3"s to the left or right edges of these segments if the segment contains a 6 nearby; left edges get 3 if above/below 6 favors left (e.g., min position comparison), right edges get 3 conditionally based on max positions or bottom-row presence of 6s, with special handling for the very last segment.
 * Top even row only considers below 6s (no above), bottom even row only considers above 6s and treats it as "is_bottom=True" (no below), internal even rows consider both above and below 6s.
 * Extra rules for even rows: If position 0 is set to 3 and the above min-6 is <=4 positions away, extend 3 to position 1 if it's 8; similarly, if last position is 3 and distance to above max-6 is <=4, extend to second-last if 8— these seem like proximity-based extensions for subtle edge blending.
 * Zeros remain 0 unless overridden, and the process assumes uniform width across rows; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtle: The 3 placements are directional (left-favoring based on min comparisons, right based on max), and bottom row's right-edge logic differs (uses has6_last instead of max comparison); also, the "extras" extensions are asymmetric and only trigger under specific distance thresholds (e.g., <=4), which might handle visual tapering or connection rules.
 * Overall, the rules seem to simulate drawing connections or fills between "object" outlines (8s) with hooks (3s) and markers (6s), possibly for a connect-the-dots or pattern completion puzzle; misses could occur in edge cases like no 6s (inf/-inf mins/maxes), single-row grids, or wide gaps without 6s (no 3s added).
 * Considerations from code: Use sets for 6 positions for efficiency; handle m=1 or m=2 specially to avoid index errors; the segment processing iterates zeros and appends w to catch the end.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set

```

    # Core for even rows: base 8 fill, override 6s from above/below union, then add 3s to zero-segment edges based on 6 proximity/min-max comparisons, with extras for extensions.
    # (Full implementation as in the provided code; key for directional 3 placements and bottom special cases.)

            out[i] = process_internal_even(input_row, above_six, below_six, w, False)
    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt provided, so no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Training example 1 result: CORRECT (program handled the rules accurately for that case).
 * Training example 2 result: CORRECT (demonstrates robustness for varied inputs, like different 7 sequences or 6 propagations).
 * The process_content_row function works well for odd-row 777 replacements but is in-place and assumes no overlapping triples (skips 3 after match, which is correct for non-overlapping).
 * get_six_positions is essential and correct for identifying vertical influences.
 * process_top_even and process_internal_even capture core even-row logic, including 3 placements, but the segment-based 3 logic might be overly complex or miss cases where gaps are at edges (e.g., leading/trailing zeros without 6s get no 3s unless extras trigger).
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the min/max inf handling in internal_even could be brittle if no 6s (defaults to no left/right favoritism).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns), generated by running the program on an unseen test input; it shows consistent application of rules, e.g., odd rows have 6s and 8s (likely from 777 replacements), even rows have base 8s with 6 overrides (e.g., vertical 6s aligning), and 3s on edges of zero gaps near 6s (e.g., row 4 has 3 at pos 8 and 15-16 near 6 at 13; row 18 has multiple 3s framing 6s and gaps).
 * It makes sense overall: Patterns like repeated [8s, 6, 8s] in odd rows propagate 6s down to even rows, zero segments get 3-bounded where adjacent to 6s (e.g., row 2 has 3 at start and near end 6), and extras extend 3s in places like row 10's leading 3s or row 18's paired 3s— this visually suggests connecting or outlining shapes without breaks.
 * No obvious errors: Zeros stay empty, no invalid numbers, width=17 consistent, bottom row (18) has 3s only where has6_last or above influences (e.g., 6s at 3,12 propagate). If incorrect, it might over-extend 3s in wide gaps (unknown without expected output), but it aligns with rule intent for a coherent visual transformation.

[2025-10-01 21:12:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where input grids with numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) represent frames and content areas; the goal is to transform the grid by replacing patterns in content rows (odd indices) and adjusting frame rows (even indices) to draw borders with 3s, place 6s based on adjacent content, fill with 8s, and handle zeros/segments specially, likely simulating some kind of enclosed drawing or puzzle visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Content rows (odd indices) must scan for consecutive 7-7-7 patterns and replace them specifically with 8-6-8, skipping ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlaps; this seems to "draw" vertical elements or supports in content.
 * Frame rows (even indices) collect 6 positions from adjacent content rows (above and below) and place 6s there, but only if the frame cell isn't already non-zero (avoids overwriting).
 * Borders on upper frames use 3s conditionally: left/right edges get 3s if the first/last 6 from above is within 4 positions of the edge or if the row has any zero; this seems intended to extend borders inward but is over-triggering in attempts.
 * Closing 3s: For non-bottom frames, place a 3 left of any zero if the zero is after the max 6 position; this handles "gaps" but is applying too broadly, creating unwanted borders.
 * Bottom frame is special: Treat zeros as segment dividers, and for each segment (between zeros), place a left 3 only if it contains a 6; always place a rightmost 3; if no zeros, it's a single segment with left 3 only if it has a 6.
 * Zeros represent empty/unfilled areas that shouldn't extend frames; frames should be full 8s where no content influence, but attempts add 3s too aggressively, especially on edges without justification.
 * Subtlety: Frames don't always border on every edge—e.g., top frames may not need left/right 3s if content 6s are centered, and bottom handles segments to avoid over-bordering empty parts.
 * Has_zero flag in upper borders seems to force edge 3s if any zero exists, but this is too loose and causes mismatches (e.g., adding 3s where expected is 8).
 * Max_six for closing only applies after max 6, but in attempts, it leads to 3s in wrong places like mid-row.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal bordering: 3s only where needed to close/enclose 6-influenced areas, not blanket edges; 8s fill everything else in frames.
 * Easy to miss: No overwriting of existing non-zeros in frames; bottom segment logic must skip empty segments (start > end).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., w=19 in ex1, w=16 in ex2), so code must be width-agnostic; assume all rows same length.
 * Process content first, then frames top-to-bottom, but upper frames look at above content only for borders (below for 6s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import inf

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for replacing 7 patterns in content rows to create vertical 6 supports.)

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> set:
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```
(Useful for extracting 6 positions from content to propagate to frames.)

```python
def place_sixes(row: List[int], six_pos: set) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in six_pos:
        if 0 <= j < w and row[j] != 0:
            row[j] = 6
```
(Helpful for safely placing 6s in frames without overwriting non-zeros, but note: the condition row[j] != 0 might be too strict if frames start as 0s everywhere.)

The main program structure (copy grid, process odd rows first, then even rows with 6 propagation and border logic) is a good skeleton, but border/closing functions are flawed.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def handle_upper_frame_borders(out: List[List[int]], i: int, six_pos_above_first: int, six_pos_above_last: int, has_zero: bool) -> None:
    # ... (as in code)
```
(This is broken: over-places 3s on edges if has_zero is true anywhere in row, leading to extra borders; the <=4 condition doesn't align with examples where centered content leaves edges as 8.)

```python
def handle_closing_threes(row: List[int], six_pos: set, max_six: int) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in range(w):
        if row[j] == 0 and max_six <= j and j > 0:
            row[j - 1] = 3
```
(This is unhelpful/broken: applies closing 3s too early and without segment awareness, creating mid-frame borders where expected is continuous 8s; ignores right-side symmetry.)

```python
def handle_bottom_frame(out: List[int], i: int, six_pos: set) -> None:  # Note: param is List[int], should be List[List[int]]
    # ... (as in code)
```
(Broken: param type error (out is grid, but func takes List[int]); segment logic misses some cases like no left 3 for empty segments, and always adds right 3 even for empty full row; in ex1, it generates correct-ish bottom but with wrong left 3s in segments.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it partially succeeds: content row processing (7->8-6-8) appears correct in both trainings (e.g., 6s placed where expected in odd rows), and 6 propagation to frames works (matches 6 positions in evens).
 * What worked: Pattern replacement in content is accurate; collecting 6s from adjacent rows is right; bottom segment detection identifies zeros correctly in some cases (e.g., ex1 bottom has 8,8,0,3... matching expected start).
 * What didn't work: Frame borders over-place 3s, e.g., in train1 row0 (top frame), generated [3,8,...3] vs expected [8,8,...8]—no reason for edge 3s since content below starts 6s centered; similarly, row2 [3,3,8...] vs [3,3,8...] wait, actually row2 left 3s match but right ends with 3 vs 8.
 * Train1 mismatches: Row0 full edges 3s (wrong, should be 8s); row4 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row6 right [3,3] matches but left over-3? Wait, left [3,3] matches; row8 [3,8,...3] matches but internal 3 at pos15 wrong (expected no 3 there, it's 3,0,8,8,3 but generated has 3 before 0); row10 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row12 [8,8,0,3,...] matches expected [8,8,0,3,...].
 * Train2 mismatches: Row0 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row2 right [8,3] vs [8,8]; row4 [3,8,...3,3] vs [8,8,...3,3] (left 3 wrong); row6 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row8 [3,3,...3,3] matches; row10 [3,8,...3] vs expected [3,8,...3] wait, but expected ends 8,3? Wait, generated ends 8,3 matching, but left 3 might be extra.
 * General issue: has_zero forces too many edge 3s (e.g., any zero triggers full borders, but examples show edges stay 8 if content doesn't reach edges); closing_threes adds 3s after max_6 even in filled areas.
 * Bottom handling somewhat works but fails empty segments (e.g., adds left 3 where no 6).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs of 6s or enclosures) were attempted, but might be needed for better segment/border decisions—current code lacks holistic view of enclosed areas.
 * Attempts show understanding of alternating row types and 6 propagation, but miss subtlety that 3s are only for actual enclosure edges, not prophylactic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It has excessive 3s on frame edges and internals, e.g., row0 [3,8,...3] likely should be full 8s like train1 top (content below has 6s centered at pos10-11, not near edges); row2 [3,8,...3] probably wrong left 3 (content below sparse); row4 ends [3,3] but has internal 0 without proper closing; row6 [3,8,...3] vs likely [8,8,...8]; row10 [3,3,...3] has early left 3s and internal 3 before 0; row12 [3,8,...3] wrong edges; row14 [3,8,...3] wrong; row16 [3,8,...3] wrong; row18 [3,8,...0,3,...3] has 0 with 3 before but possibly wrong internal 3 at pos8.
 * Mentally simulating rules on test input (assuming similar to trains: input has 7s in odds replaced to 6s, frames start 0s): After content process, odds will have 6s at specific spots (e.g., row1 likely 6 at 10-11, row3 at 13-14, etc.); frames should propagate those 6s and add 3s only to enclose (e.g., left 3 only if 6 near left, no blanket edges); bottom row18 should segment on 0 at ~pos7 and pos? , adding 3s per has_6 but generated has extra 3 at pos8 and ends 3 correctly but left likely wrong. Overall, output looks over-bordered, missing continuous 8 fills where no enclosure needed—doesn't match inferred correct (more 8-heavy frames like train expects).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing line segments, colors, or structural elements in a diagram like a floor plan or abstract pattern) that undergoes transformation rules to generate a new grid. The rules focus on detecting and modifying patterns in odd rows (e.g., sequences of 7s) and applying conditional overlays (e.g., 3s for edges or boundaries) to even rows based on adjacent "centers," zeros, and positional logic between upper/lower elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by identifying non-overlapping sequences of three consecutive 7s, replacing them with [8, 6, 8] to mark a "center" at the middle position; this skips over the triple to avoid overlap, but misses if 7s are isolated or in pairs.
 * Even rows start with a base layer: positions with 0 stay 0, centers from adjacent odd rows get 6, and all other non-zero positions get 8; this creates a foundational "fill" that gets overlaid.
 * Overlays for even rows vary by position: top rows have no overlays (pure base), bottom rows add 3s to the start of non-zero segments (if base is 8) and always to the end if 8; internal even rows use complex left/right placement logic based on the relative positions of min/max centers from upper and lower odd rows (e.g., place left 3 if no lower centers or if upper min < lower min), plus pre-pending 3 before zeros if adjacent base is 8, and boundary adjustments only if no zeros.
 * Subtle edge cases: Zeros in input rows block or trigger specific 3 placements (e.g., sides always get 3 if zeros present); segments in bottom overlays are contiguous non-zeros, and 3s only apply if the base is 8; centers are sets to handle multiples without overlap.
 * Global considerations: Grid dimensions (m rows, n cols) must be handled dynamically; assume even rows are 0,2,... and odd 1,3,...; no modifications to input zeros except in base; potential for multiple centers per row affecting adjacents; rules seem to simulate "structural supports" or "boundaries" around detected objects (7-triples as holes or features).
 * Easy-to-miss: The left/right placement in internal evens depends on comparative positions of entire center sets (min/max), not individual; if no upper/lower, defaults to full placement; bottom end always gets 3 if 8, regardless of segments; the i+=3 skip in odd processing ensures non-overlapping but may leave trailing 7s untouched if not in triples.
 * All attempts considered: No object extraction needed (rules are row-wise, not holistic); focus on adjacency between odd/even pairs; potential for visual alignment (e.g., 6 as vertical supports, 3/8 as horizontals, 0 as voids); test grids may have irregular zero placements or multiple centers requiring precise min/max logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set

def find_centers(row: List[int], n: int) -> Set[int]:
    """Extracts center positions (middle of every non-overlapping triple of 7s) in an odd row."""
    centers: Set[int] = set()
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        if row[i] == 7 and row[i + 1] == 7 and row[i + 2] == 7:
            centers.add(i + 1)
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return centers
```

```python
def process_odd_row(input_row: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Replaces non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8] in odd rows, leaving others intact."""
    new_row = input_row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + 2 < n and input_row[i] == 7 and input_row[i + 1] == 7 and input_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def compute_base_even(row_input: List[int], adj_centers: Set[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Creates base for even rows: 0 stays 0, adj centers get 6, others 8 if non-zero."""
    new_row = [0] * n
    for j in range(n):
        if row_input[j] == 0:
            new_row[j] = 0
        elif j in adj_centers:
            new_row[j] = 6
        else:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```

(The overlay functions like apply_internal_even_overlays, apply_bottom_overlays are helpful for specific row types but overly complex; simplify left/right logic if min/max comparisons fail edge cases. No types beyond List[List[int]] needed. No extraction functions for full objects, as rules are local to rows/adjacencies.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row processing (triple 7 detection and replacement) and base even row computation, as evidenced by both training examples passing.
 * Internal even row overlays work for simple cases (e.g., no zeros, single centers) but may mishandle complex min/max comparisons for left/right placement when multiple upper/lower centers overlap or are symmetric, potentially placing 3s incorrectly on boundaries.
 * Bottom row overlays correctly add 3s to segment starts and ends but might over-apply if segments are short (<3) or if zeros interrupt in ways that create unintended 8-to-3 changes before zeros (the pre-pend logic is in internal, not bottom, which could be a miss).
 * Top rows are correctly left as base (no overlays), which is simple and likely right.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core row-wise processing; however, the adj_centers union from upper/lower is essential but assumes centers are only in odd rows (correct per code).
 * The has_zero flag and pre-pending 3 before zeros (in internal) is a good subtlety but only applies if base left is 8, which might miss if zero is at edge.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and correct for non-overlapping triples; process_odd_row is solid but doesn't handle overlapping possibles (though puzzle likely doesn't have them).
 * apply_internal_even_overlays is helpful but convoluted—its place_left/place_right logic based on min/max could be broken for test cases with equal min/max (defaults to False, potentially no side 3s when needed).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though overlay apps could be merged for clarity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns), with visible patterns like repeated [8,8,...,6,8,...] in evens and [0,... ,6,8,...] in odds, plus 3s at edges/segments, which looks visually consistent with a structural overlay puzzle (e.g., 6s as supports under 7-triple centers, 3s as boundaries around voids/0s).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows show processed 6s where triples were, evens have bases with 6s at adj centers and 3s on sides/bottoms; for example, row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10, matching a likely 7-triple, and adjacent evens (rows 0/2) have 6 there with 8s elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots—e.g., row 4 (even, internal?) has 3s at cols 0,6,16 but a 0 at col7, suggesting pre-pend logic applied, but if this is bottom-like, the segment 3s might be over-applied (row 4: [3,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] ends with 3 at col16, but trailing 8s after 0 might need different handling); row 8 (even) has 3s at end [...,3,3] which seems like bottom rule but positionally odd if not bottom row.
 * Differences from expected: Without exact expected output, hard to confirm, but potential issues include extra 3s in internal rows (e.g., row 14: [8,... ,3,3] at end, possibly misplaced if not bottom) or missed 3s before zeros (e.g., row 17: [3,8,8,6,... ,0,3] has 0 at col6? Wait, listed as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,...]—the 0 at col7 followed by 3 at col8 suggests segment start 3, but if base was 8 before 0, why no pre-pend? This indicates the internal pre-pend logic might be broken or not triggered, differing from expected boundary reinforcement).
 * Another mismatch: Row 2 (even) has [3,3,8,... ,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] with leading 3s and internal 6s, but if adj centers are at cols 10 and 13?, the double 3 at start might be over-placement if has_zero=True (many 0s in input?); looks like it places left even with zeros, but expected might skip if lower centers dominate.
 * Overall, test output is plausible (80% match vibe) but likely incorrect in 2-3 rows due to left/right logic or zero-handling subtleties—e.g., row 16 (odd? Wait, output row16: [8,8,8,6,...] seems even-like, but indexing off); needs adjustment for comparative center positions in multi-center tests.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines, fills, or shapes in a diagram) where rules transform input patterns, particularly propagating "6" markers vertically and horizontally while modifying edges with "3"s and handling special sequences like three consecutive "7"s in odd rows to create asymmetric or directional effects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content rows) are processed by scanning for sequences of three consecutive 7s and replacing them with [8, 6, 8], which introduces a "6" marker in the middle; this skips ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-7 sequences just increment by 1.
 * Even rows start by converting non-zero cells to 8 (like a base fill), then override positions directly above or below a 6 (from adjacent odd rows) to 6, creating vertical propagation of "6" influences.
 * In even rows, after base filling, identify segments of zeros (empty gaps) and add "3"s to the left or right edges of these segments if the segment contains a 6 nearby; left edges get 3 if above/below 6 favors left (e.g., min position comparison), right edges get 3 conditionally based on max positions or bottom-row presence of 6s, with special handling for the very last segment.
 * Top even row only considers below 6s (no above), bottom even row only considers above 6s and treats it as "is_bottom=True" (no below), internal even rows consider both above and below 6s.
 * Extra rules for even rows: If position 0 is set to 3 and the above min-6 is <=4 positions away, extend 3 to position 1 if it's 8; similarly, if last position is 3 and distance to above max-6 is <=4, extend to second-last if 8— these seem like proximity-based extensions for subtle edge blending.
 * Zeros remain 0 unless overridden, and the process assumes uniform width across rows; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtle: The 3 placements are directional (left-favoring based on min comparisons, right based on max), and bottom row's right-edge logic differs (uses has6_last instead of max comparison); also, the "extras" extensions are asymmetric and only trigger under specific distance thresholds (e.g., <=4), which might handle visual tapering or connection rules.
 * Overall, the rules seem to simulate drawing connections or fills between "object" outlines (8s) with hooks (3s) and markers (6s), possibly for a connect-the-dots or pattern completion puzzle; misses could occur in edge cases like no 6s (inf/-inf mins/maxes), single-row grids, or wide gaps without 6s (no 3s added).
 * Considerations from code: Use sets for 6 positions for efficiency; handle m=1 or m=2 specially to avoid index errors; the segment processing iterates zeros and appends w to catch the end.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt provided, so no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Training example 1 result: CORRECT (program handled the rules accurately for that case).
 * Training example 2 result: CORRECT (demonstrates robustness for varied inputs, like different 7 sequences or 6 propagations).
 * The process_content_row function works well for odd-row 777 replacements but is in-place and assumes no overlapping triples (skips 3 after match, which is correct for non-overlapping).
 * get_six_positions is essential and correct for identifying vertical influences.
 * process_top_even and process_internal_even capture core even-row logic, including 3 placements, but the segment-based 3 logic might be overly complex or miss cases where gaps are at edges (e.g., leading/trailing zeros without 6s get no 3s unless extras trigger).
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the min/max inf handling in internal_even could be brittle if no 6s (defaults to no left/right favoritism).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns), generated by running the program on an unseen test input; it shows consistent application of rules, e.g., odd rows have 6s and 8s (likely from 777 replacements), even rows have base 8s with 6 overrides (e.g., vertical 6s aligning), and 3s on edges of zero gaps near 6s (e.g., row 4 has 3 at pos 8 and 15-16 near 6 at 13; row 18 has multiple 3s framing 6s and gaps).
 * It makes sense overall: Patterns like repeated [8s, 6, 8s] in odd rows propagate 6s down to even rows, zero segments get 3-bounded where adjacent to 6s (e.g., row 2 has 3 at start and near end 6), and extras extend 3s in places like row 10's leading 3s or row 18's paired 3s— this visually suggests connecting or outlining shapes without breaks.
 * No obvious errors: Zeros stay empty, no invalid numbers, width=17 consistent, bottom row (18) has 3s only where has6_last or above influences (e.g., 6s at 3,12 propagate). If incorrect, it might over-extend 3s in wide gaps (unknown without expected output), but it aligns with rule intent for a coherent visual transformation.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:20:42] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving row-by-row processing of a binary-like grid (using numbers 0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special markers like holes or anchors, 3 for boundary/edge markers, and 7 as a temporary pattern in odd rows). The goal is to transform the input grid by first modifying odd rows to detect and replace patterns of three 7s with an 8-6-8 sequence (indicating a detected "object" or segment with a hole), then updating even rows to fill with 8s everywhere non-zero in the original, place 6s at positions aligned with 6s in adjacent odd rows, and insert 3s at segment edges, gaps, or boundaries to denote closures or starts, while handling top/bottom edges differently.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, i.e., rows 1,3,5...) are pre-processed only for sequences of exactly three consecutive 7s, replacing them with 8-6-8 to mark a "hole" or internal feature; longer or shorter 7 sequences are ignored, and this scan advances by 3 only on match, otherwise by 1.
 * Even rows (0-based indexing, i.e., rows 0,2,4...) start as 8s where original was non-zero (ignoring zeros as gaps), with 6s overlaid from the union of 6 positions in the immediately above and below odd rows (if they exist); top row (i=0) has no above, bottom row (i=m-1 if even) has no below.
 * 3s are placed as "edge closures": for non-top even rows, opening 3s replace leading 8s after a 0-gap if the following segment has a 6; closing 3s replace trailing 8s before a 0-gap if the segment has a 6 (but only for non-bottom rows).
 * Edge 3s (left/rightmost positions): For bottom even rows, left 3 at position 0 if there's a left segment with 6s before the first 0, extending to position 1 if the min 6 is <=4 positions away; similarly right 3 at w-1, extending to w-2 if max 6 is <=4 from end. For internal even rows (not top/bottom), left/right 3s only if both above and below have 6-segments and the upper segment protrudes (min/max mismatch with lower).
 * Subtleties: 3s only apply to segments containing at least one 6 (no 3s for 8-only segments); zeros in original even rows create gaps that split segments but don't propagate 6s across; top row gets no edge 3s; bottom row skips internal closing 3s but gets special edge handling; overlapping 6s from above/below union without conflict; process odd rows first on a copy, then even rows using original for non-zero check but modified odds for 6 positions.
 * Gaps between segments: Internal gaps (zeros) trigger opening/closing 3s only if the adjacent segment has 6s, and scans must handle multiple segments per row without overlapping modifications.
 * Easy to miss: The 7-pattern replacement is greedy but non-overlapping (j+=3 on match); edge extensions for 3s are distance-limited (<=4 positions); no 3s on top row; bottom row's edge 3s use original zeros for "first/last zero" boundaries; internal edge 3s require both adjacent odds to have 6s and protrusion.
 * All considerations: Preserve zeros in even rows initially but override with 8/6/3; no changes to odd rows after initial 7-processing; width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles the 7-to-8-6-8 replacement in odd rows and basic 6 placement in even rows via union of adjacent 6s.
 * Correctly processes training example 1 and 2 fully, indicating core rules for segment filling with 8s, 6 overlays, and basic edge/gap 3s are captured.
 * Handles top row by skipping above 6s and no edge 3s; bottom row skips closing 3s but applies special left/right edge 3s based on first/last zero and proximity (<=4).
 * Internal edge 3s correctly condition on both above/below having 6s and protrusion (min/max mismatch).
 * Gap handling separates opening 3s (after 0 to 8 with 6 in segment) and closing 3s (8 to 0 with 6 in segment), but closing only for non-bottom; scans are careful to skip zeros and process segment-by-segment.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; process_content_row and get_six_positions are essential and correct for detecting 7-patterns and extracting 6 anchors.
 * Potential misses: Edge extensions might over-apply if w is small; internal gap scans could loop inefficiently but work; no handling for overlapping segments or non-uniform w (assumes uniform).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output processes 19 rows (odd count, so last is even? Wait, listed as 19 lines but may be 18+1; assumes m=18 or similar), with odd rows showing 7-replacements (e.g., row 1 has 6 at pos 10, row 3 at 13, row 5 at 13? Wait, output shows modified odds implicitly via evens).
 * Even rows mostly fill with 8s where original non-zero, 6s at union positions (e.g., row 0 has 6 at 10, matching below; row 2 has 6s at 10 and 13; row 4 has 6 at 13, 3 at 8?).
 * 3s appear at edges/gaps: e.g., row 2 starts with 3 (opening after implied gap? But row 2: [3,8,...6 at 10,8,6 at 13,...]); row 4 has 3 at 8 (internal?); row 8 ends with 3; row 10 has 3 at 9; row 14 ends with 3; row 16 has no leading 3 but 6s; row 18 has leading 3s at 0-1, ends with 3s at 15-16.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8], the 3 at position 8 seems like a closing 3 before a 0 at 7? But position 7 is 0, and segment before has no 6 (all 8s from 0-6), so no 3 should be there per rules (3s only for segments with 6); this indicates bug in closing 3 logic applying without 6 check in some gaps. Similarly, row 18 [3,3,8,6,...3,3] has double 3s at start/end, which matches edge extension (<=4 from min/max 6), but if no protrusion or wrong first_zero, it over-applies. Row 10 [8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] has 3 at 9 before 0 at 10, but segment 4-9 has 6 at 4, so closing 3 ok, but why 0 at 10 preserved while later 8s? Expected: more consistent gap handling without stray 0s in output even rows unless original. Overall, core 6/8 placement seems correct, but 3 placements have errors in non-6 segments and possibly bottom edge miscalculation; test mismatches expected by applying 3s to 8-only segments and incorrect internal closings.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:20:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where input grids with numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) represent frames and content areas; the goal is to transform the grid by replacing patterns in content rows (odd indices) and adjusting frame rows (even indices) to draw borders with 3s, place 6s based on adjacent content, fill with 8s, and handle zeros/segments specially, likely simulating some kind of enclosed drawing or puzzle visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Content rows (odd indices) must scan for consecutive 7-7-7 patterns and replace them specifically with 8-6-8, skipping ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlaps; this seems to "draw" vertical elements or supports in content.
 * Frame rows (even indices) collect 6 positions from adjacent content rows (above and below) and place 6s there, but only if the frame cell isn't already non-zero (avoids overwriting).
 * Borders on upper frames use 3s conditionally: left/right edges get 3s if the first/last 6 from above is within 4 positions of the edge or if the row has any zero; this seems intended to extend borders inward but is over-triggering in attempts.
 * Closing 3s: For non-bottom frames, place a 3 left of any zero if the zero is after the max 6 position; this handles "gaps" but is applying too broadly, creating unwanted borders.
 * Bottom frame is special: Treat zeros as segment dividers, and for each segment (between zeros), place a left 3 only if it contains a 6; always place a rightmost 3; if no zeros, it's a single segment with left 3 only if it has a 6.
 * Zeros represent empty/unfilled areas that shouldn't extend frames; frames should be full 8s where no content influence, but attempts add 3s too aggressively, especially on edges without justification.
 * Subtlety: Frames don't always border on every edge—e.g., top frames may not need left/right 3s if content 6s are centered, and bottom handles segments to avoid over-bordering empty parts.
 * Has_zero flag in upper borders seems to force edge 3s if any zero exists, but this is too loose and causes mismatches (e.g., adding 3s where expected is 8).
 * Max_six for closing only applies after max 6, but in attempts, it leads to 3s in wrong places like mid-row.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal bordering: 3s only where needed to close/enclose 6-influenced areas, not blanket edges; 8s fill everything else in frames.
 * Easy to miss: No overwriting of existing non-zeros in frames; bottom segment logic must skip empty segments (start > end).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., w=19 in ex1, w=16 in ex2), so code must be width-agnostic; assume all rows same length.
 * Process content first, then frames top-to-bottom, but upper frames look at above content only for borders (below for 6s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import inf

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for replacing 7 patterns in content rows to create vertical 6 supports.)

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> set:
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```
(Useful for extracting 6 positions from content to propagate to frames.)

```python
def place_sixes(row: List[int], six_pos: set) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in six_pos:
        if 0 <= j < w and row[j] != 0:
            row[j] = 6
```
(Helpful for safely placing 6s in frames without overwriting non-zeros, but note: the condition row[j] != 0 might be too strict if frames start as 0s everywhere.)

The main program structure (copy grid, process odd rows first, then even rows with 6 propagation and border logic) is a good skeleton, but border/closing functions are flawed.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def handle_upper_frame_borders(out: List[List[int]], i: int, six_pos_above_first: int, six_pos_above_last: int, has_zero: bool) -> None:
    # ... (as in code)
```
(This is broken: over-places 3s on edges if has_zero is true anywhere in row, leading to extra borders; the <=4 condition doesn't align with examples where centered content leaves edges as 8.)

```python
def handle_closing_threes(row: List[int], six_pos: set, max_six: int) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in range(w):
        if row[j] == 0 and max_six <= j and j > 0:
            row[j - 1] = 3
```
(This is unhelpful/broken: applies closing 3s too early and without segment awareness, creating mid-frame borders where expected is continuous 8s; ignores right-side symmetry.)

```python
def handle_bottom_frame(out: List[int], i: int, six_pos: set) -> None:  # Note: param is List[int], should be List[List[int]]
    # ... (as in code)
```
(Broken: param type error (out is grid, but func takes List[int]); segment logic misses some cases like no left 3 for empty segments, and always adds right 3 even for empty full row; in ex1, it generates correct-ish bottom but with wrong left 3s in segments.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it partially succeeds: content row processing (7->8-6-8) appears correct in both trainings (e.g., 6s placed where expected in odd rows), and 6 propagation to frames works (matches 6 positions in evens).
 * What worked: Pattern replacement in content is accurate; collecting 6s from adjacent rows is right; bottom segment detection identifies zeros correctly in some cases (e.g., ex1 bottom has 8,8,0,3... matching expected start).
 * What didn't work: Frame borders over-place 3s, e.g., in train1 row0 (top frame), generated [3,8,...3] vs expected [8,8,...8]—no reason for edge 3s since content below starts 6s centered; similarly, row2 [3,3,8...] vs [3,3,8...] wait, actually row2 left 3s match but right ends with 3 vs 8.
 * Train1 mismatches: Row0 full edges 3s (wrong, should be 8s); row4 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row6 right [3,3] matches but left over-3? Wait, left [3,3] matches; row8 [3,8,...3] matches but internal 3 at pos15 wrong (expected no 3 there, it's 3,0,8,8,3 but generated has 3 before 0); row10 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row12 [8,8,0,3,...] matches expected [8,8,0,3,...].
 * Train2 mismatches: Row0 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row2 right [8,3] vs [8,8]; row4 [3,8,...3,3] vs [8,8,...3,3] (left 3 wrong); row6 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row8 [3,3,...3,3] matches; row10 [3,8,...3] vs expected [3,8,...3] wait, but expected ends 8,3? Wait, generated ends 8,3 matching, but left 3 might be extra.
 * General issue: has_zero forces too many edge 3s (e.g., any zero triggers full borders, but examples show edges stay 8 if content doesn't reach edges); closing_threes adds 3s after max_6 even in filled areas.
 * Bottom handling somewhat works but fails empty segments (e.g., adds left 3 where no 6).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs of 6s or enclosures) were attempted, but might be needed for better segment/border decisions—current code lacks holistic view of enclosed areas.
 * Attempts show understanding of alternating row types and 6 propagation, but miss subtlety that 3s are only for actual enclosure edges, not prophylactic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It has excessive 3s on frame edges and internals, e.g., row0 [3,8,...3] likely should be full 8s like train1 top (content below has 6s centered at pos10-11, not near edges); row2 [3,8,...3] probably wrong left 3 (content below sparse); row4 ends [3,3] but has internal 0 without proper closing; row6 [3,8,...3] vs likely [8,8,...8]; row10 [3,3,...3] has early left 3s and internal 3 before 0; row12 [3,8,...3] wrong edges; row14 [3,8,...3] wrong; row16 [3,8,...3] wrong; row18 [3,8,...0,3,...3] has 0 with 3 before but possibly wrong internal 3 at pos8.
 * Mentally simulating rules on test input (assuming similar to trains: input has 7s in odds replaced to 6s, frames start 0s): After content process, odds will have 6s at specific spots (e.g., row1 likely 6 at 10-11, row3 at 13-14, etc.); frames should propagate those 6s and add 3s only to enclose (e.g., left 3 only if 6 near left, no blanket edges); bottom row18 should segment on 0 at ~pos7 and pos? , adding 3s per has_6 but generated has extra 3 at pos8 and ends 3 correctly but left likely wrong. Overall, output looks over-bordered, missing continuous 8 fills where no enclosure needed—doesn't match inferred correct (more 8-heavy frames like train expects).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing line segments, colors, or structural elements in a diagram like a floor plan or abstract pattern) that undergoes transformation rules to generate a new grid. The rules focus on detecting and modifying patterns in odd rows (e.g., sequences of 7s) and applying conditional overlays (e.g., 3s for edges or boundaries) to even rows based on adjacent "centers," zeros, and positional logic between upper/lower elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by identifying non-overlapping sequences of three consecutive 7s, replacing them with [8, 6, 8] to mark a "center" at the middle position; this skips over the triple to avoid overlap, but misses if 7s are isolated or in pairs.
 * Even rows start with a base layer: positions with 0 stay 0, centers from adjacent odd rows get 6, and all other non-zero positions get 8; this creates a foundational "fill" that gets overlaid.
 * Overlays for even rows vary by position: top rows have no overlays (pure base), bottom rows add 3s to the start of non-zero segments (if base is 8) and always to the end if 8; internal even rows use complex left/right placement logic based on the relative positions of min/max centers from upper and lower odd rows (e.g., place left 3 if no lower centers or if upper min < lower min), plus pre-pending 3 before zeros if adjacent base is 8, and boundary adjustments only if no zeros.
 * Subtle edge cases: Zeros in input rows block or trigger specific 3 placements (e.g., sides always get 3 if zeros present); segments in bottom overlays are contiguous non-zeros, and 3s only apply if the base is 8; centers are sets to handle multiples without overlap.
 * Global considerations: Grid dimensions (m rows, n cols) must be handled dynamically; assume even rows are 0,2,... and odd 1,3,...; no modifications to input zeros except in base; potential for multiple centers per row affecting adjacents; rules seem to simulate "structural supports" or "boundaries" around detected objects (7-triples as holes or features).
 * Easy-to-miss: The left/right placement in internal evens depends on comparative positions of entire center sets (min/max), not individual; if no upper/lower, defaults to full placement; bottom end always gets 3 if 8, regardless of segments; the i+=3 skip in odd processing ensures non-overlapping but may leave trailing 7s untouched if not in triples.
 * All attempts considered: No object extraction needed (rules are row-wise, not holistic); focus on adjacency between odd/even pairs; potential for visual alignment (e.g., 6 as vertical supports, 3/8 as horizontals, 0 as voids); test grids may have irregular zero placements or multiple centers requiring precise min/max logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Set

def find_centers(row: List[int], n: int) -> Set[int]:

    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        if row[i] == 7 and row[i + 1] == 7 and row[i + 2] == 7:
            centers.add(i + 1)
            i += 3
        else:

    """Replaces non-overlapping triples of 7s with [8,6,8] in odd rows, leaving others intact."""

    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + 2 < n and input_row[i] == 7 and input_row[i + 1] == 7 and input_row[i + 2] == 7:
            new_row[i] = 8
            new_row[i + 1] = 6
            new_row[i + 2] = 8
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def compute_base_even(row_input: List[int], adj_centers: Set[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Creates base for even rows: 0 stays 0, adj centers get 6, others 8 if non-zero."""
    new_row = [0] * n
    for j in range(n):
        if row_input[j] == 0:
            new_row[j] = 0
        elif j in adj_centers:
            new_row[j] = 6
        else:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```

(The overlay functions like apply_internal_even_overlays, apply_bottom_overlays are helpful for specific row types but overly complex; simplify left/right logic if min/max comparisons fail edge cases. No types beyond List[List[int]] needed. No extraction functions for full objects, as rules are local to rows/adjacencies.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row processing (triple 7 detection and replacement) and base even row computation, as evidenced by both training examples passing.
 * Internal even row overlays work for simple cases (e.g., no zeros, single centers) but may mishandle complex min/max comparisons for left/right placement when multiple upper/lower centers overlap or are symmetric, potentially placing 3s incorrectly on boundaries.
 * Bottom row overlays correctly add 3s to segment starts and ends but might over-apply if segments are short (<3) or if zeros interrupt in ways that create unintended 8-to-3 changes before zeros (the pre-pend logic is in internal, not bottom, which could be a miss).
 * Top rows are correctly left as base (no overlays), which is simple and likely right.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core row-wise processing; however, the adj_centers union from upper/lower is essential but assumes centers are only in odd rows (correct per code).
 * The has_zero flag and pre-pending 3 before zeros (in internal) is a good subtlety but only applies if base left is 8, which might miss if zero is at edge.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and correct for non-overlapping triples; process_odd_row is solid but doesn't handle overlapping possibles (though puzzle likely doesn't have them).
 * apply_internal_even_overlays is helpful but convoluted—its place_left/place_right logic based on min/max could be broken for test cases with equal min/max (defaults to False, potentially no side 3s when needed).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though overlay apps could be merged for clarity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns), with visible patterns like repeated [8,8,...,6,8,...] in evens and [0,... ,6,8,...] in odds, plus 3s at edges/segments, which looks visually consistent with a structural overlay puzzle (e.g., 6s as supports under 7-triple centers, 3s as boundaries around voids/0s).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows show processed 6s where triples were, evens have bases with 6s at adj centers and 3s on sides/bottoms; for example, row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10, matching a likely 7-triple, and adjacent evens (rows 0/2) have 6 there with 8s elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots—e.g., row 4 (even, internal?) has 3s at cols 0,6,16 but a 0 at col7, suggesting pre-pend logic applied, but if this is bottom-like, the segment 3s might be over-applied (row 4: [3,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] ends with 3 at col16, but trailing 8s after 0 might need different handling); row 8 (even) has 3s at end [...,3,3] which seems like bottom rule but positionally odd if not bottom row.
 * Differences from expected: Without exact expected output, hard to confirm, but potential issues include extra 3s in internal rows (e.g., row 14: [8,... ,3,3] at end, possibly misplaced if not bottom) or missed 3s before zeros (e.g., row 17: [3,8,8,6,... ,0,3] has 0 at col6? Wait, listed as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,...]—the 0 at col7 followed by 3 at col8 suggests segment start 3, but if base was 8 before 0, why no pre-pend? This indicates the internal pre-pend logic might be broken or not triggered, differing from expected boundary reinforcement).
 * Another mismatch: Row 2 (even) has [3,3,8,... ,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] with leading 3s and internal 6s, but if adj centers are at cols 10 and 13?, the double 3 at start might be over-placement if has_zero=True (many 0s in input?); looks like it places left even with zeros, but expected might skip if lower centers dominate.
 * Overall, test output is plausible (80% match vibe) but likely incorrect in 2-3 rows due to left/right logic or zero-handling subtleties—e.g., row 16 (odd? Wait, output row16: [8,8,8,6,...] seems even-like, but indexing off); needs adjustment for comparative center positions in multi-center tests.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving row-by-row processing of a binary-like grid (using numbers 0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special markers like holes or anchors, 3 for boundary/edge markers, and 7 as a temporary pattern in odd rows). The goal is to transform the input grid by first modifying odd rows to detect and replace patterns of three 7s with an 8-6-8 sequence (indicating a detected "object" or segment with a hole), then updating even rows to fill with 8s everywhere non-zero in the original, place 6s at positions aligned with 6s in adjacent odd rows, and insert 3s at segment edges, gaps, or boundaries to denote closures or starts, while handling top/bottom edges differently.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, i.e., rows 1,3,5...) are pre-processed only for sequences of exactly three consecutive 7s, replacing them with 8-6-8 to mark a "hole" or internal feature; longer or shorter 7 sequences are ignored, and this scan advances by 3 only on match, otherwise by 1.
 * Even rows (0-based indexing, i.e., rows 0,2,4...) start as 8s where original was non-zero (ignoring zeros as gaps), with 6s overlaid from the union of 6 positions in the immediately above and below odd rows (if they exist); top row (i=0) has no above, bottom row (i=m-1 if even) has no below.
 * 3s are placed as "edge closures": for non-top even rows, opening 3s replace leading 8s after a 0-gap if the following segment has a 6; closing 3s replace trailing 8s before a 0-gap if the segment has a 6 (but only for non-bottom rows).
 * Edge 3s (left/rightmost positions): For bottom even rows, left 3 at position 0 if there's a left segment with 6s before the first 0, extending to position 1 if the min 6 is <=4 positions away; similarly right 3 at w-1, extending to w-2 if max 6 is <=4 from end. For internal even rows (not top/bottom), left/right 3s only if both above and below have 6-segments and the upper segment protrudes (min/max mismatch with lower).
 * Subtleties: 3s only apply to segments containing at least one 6 (no 3s for 8-only segments); zeros in original even rows create gaps that split segments but don't propagate 6s across; top row gets no edge 3s; bottom row skips internal closing 3s but gets special edge handling; overlapping 6s from above/below union without conflict; process odd rows first on a copy, then even rows using original for non-zero check but modified odds for 6 positions.
 * Gaps between segments: Internal gaps (zeros) trigger opening/closing 3s only if the adjacent segment has 6s, and scans must handle multiple segments per row without overlapping modifications.
 * Easy to miss: The 7-pattern replacement is greedy but non-overlapping (j+=3 on match); edge extensions for 3s are distance-limited (<=4 positions); no 3s on top row; bottom row's edge 3s use original zeros for "first/last zero" boundaries; internal edge 3s require both adjacent odds to have 6s and protrusion.
 * All considerations: Preserve zeros in even rows initially but override with 8/6/3; no changes to odd rows after initial 7-processing; width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

 * Handles top row by skipping above 6s and no edge 3s; bottom row skips closing 3s but applies special left/right edge 3s based on first/last zero and proximity (<=4).
 * Internal edge 3s correctly condition on both above/below having 6s and protrusion (min/max mismatch).
 * Gap handling separates opening 3s (after 0 to 8 with 6 in segment) and closing 3s (8 to 0 with 6 in segment), but closing only for non-bottom; scans are careful to skip zeros and process segment-by-segment.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; process_content_row and get_six_positions are essential and correct for detecting 7-patterns and extracting 6 anchors.
 * Potential misses: Edge extensions might over-apply if w is small; internal gap scans could loop inefficiently but work; no handling for overlapping segments or non-uniform w (assumes uniform).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output processes 19 rows (odd count, so last is even? Wait, listed as 19 lines but may be 18+1; assumes m=18 or similar), with odd rows showing 7-replacements (e.g., row 1 has 6 at pos 10, row 3 at 13, row 5 at 13? Wait, output shows modified odds implicitly via evens).
 * Even rows mostly fill with 8s where original non-zero, 6s at union positions (e.g., row 0 has 6 at 10, matching below; row 2 has 6s at 10 and 13; row 4 has 6 at 13, 3 at 8?).
 * 3s appear at edges/gaps: e.g., row 2 starts with 3 (opening after implied gap? But row 2: [3,8,...6 at 10,8,6 at 13,...]); row 4 has 3 at 8 (internal?); row 8 ends with 3; row 10 has 3 at 9; row 14 ends with 3; row 16 has no leading 3 but 6s; row 18 has leading 3s at 0-1, ends with 3s at 15-16.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8], the 3 at position 8 seems like a closing 3 before a 0 at 7? But position 7 is 0, and segment before has no 6 (all 8s from 0-6), so no 3 should be there per rules (3s only for segments with 6); this indicates bug in closing 3 logic applying without 6 check in some gaps. Similarly, row 18 [3,3,8,6,...3,3] has double 3s at start/end, which matches edge extension (<=4 from min/max 6), but if no protrusion or wrong first_zero, it over-applies. Row 10 [8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] has 3 at 9 before 0 at 10, but segment 4-9 has 6 at 4, so closing 3 ok, but why 0 at 10 preserved while later 8s? Expected: more consistent gap handling without stray 0s in output even rows unless original. Overall, core 6/8 placement seems correct, but 3 placements have errors in non-6 segments and possibly bottom edge miscalculation; test mismatches expected by applying 3s to 8-only segments and incorrect internal closings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines, fills, or shapes in a diagram) where rules transform input patterns, particularly propagating "6" markers vertically and horizontally while modifying edges with "3"s and handling special sequences like three consecutive "7"s in odd rows to create asymmetric or directional effects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content rows) are processed by scanning for sequences of three consecutive 7s and replacing them with [8, 6, 8], which introduces a "6" marker in the middle; this skips ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-7 sequences just increment by 1.
 * Even rows start by converting non-zero cells to 8 (like a base fill), then override positions directly above or below a 6 (from adjacent odd rows) to 6, creating vertical propagation of "6" influences.
 * In even rows, after base filling, identify segments of zeros (empty gaps) and add "3"s to the left or right edges of these segments if the segment contains a 6 nearby; left edges get 3 if above/below 6 favors left (e.g., min position comparison), right edges get 3 conditionally based on max positions or bottom-row presence of 6s, with special handling for the very last segment.
 * Top even row only considers below 6s (no above), bottom even row only considers above 6s and treats it as "is_bottom=True" (no below), internal even rows consider both above and below 6s.
 * Extra rules for even rows: If position 0 is set to 3 and the above min-6 is <=4 positions away, extend 3 to position 1 if it's 8; similarly, if last position is 3 and distance to above max-6 is <=4, extend to second-last if 8— these seem like proximity-based extensions for subtle edge blending.
 * Zeros remain 0 unless overridden, and the process assumes uniform width across rows; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtle: The 3 placements are directional (left-favoring based on min comparisons, right based on max), and bottom row's right-edge logic differs (uses has6_last instead of max comparison); also, the "extras" extensions are asymmetric and only trigger under specific distance thresholds (e.g., <=4), which might handle visual tapering or connection rules.
 * Overall, the rules seem to simulate drawing connections or fills between "object" outlines (8s) with hooks (3s) and markers (6s), possibly for a connect-the-dots or pattern completion puzzle; misses could occur in edge cases like no 6s (inf/-inf mins/maxes), single-row grids, or wide gaps without 6s (no 3s added).
 * Considerations from code: Use sets for 6 positions for efficiency; handle m=1 or m=2 specially to avoid index errors; the segment processing iterates zeros and appends w to catch the end.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3

    # Core for even rows: base 8 fill, override 6s from above/below union, then add 3s to zero-segment edges based on 6 proximity/min-max comparisons, with extras for extensions.
    # (Full implementation as in the provided code; key for directional 3 placements and bottom special cases.)
    new_row = [0 if input_row[j] == 0 else 8 for j in range(w)]
    all_six = above_six.union(below_six)
    for j in all_six:

    # ... (rest of min/max, zero segments, 3 placements, extras as in code)
    return new_row
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Main orchestrator: copies input, processes odd rows first (777->868), then even rows with appropriate above/below 6s and top/bottom flags.
    # Handles edge cases like m=0,1,2; assumes all rows same width.
    if not g:

    return out

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt provided, so no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Training example 1 result: CORRECT (program handled the rules accurately for that case).
 * Training example 2 result: CORRECT (demonstrates robustness for varied inputs, like different 7 sequences or 6 propagations).
 * The process_content_row function works well for odd-row 777 replacements but is in-place and assumes no overlapping triples (skips 3 after match, which is correct for non-overlapping).
 * get_six_positions is essential and correct for identifying vertical influences.
 * process_top_even and process_internal_even capture core even-row logic, including 3 placements, but the segment-based 3 logic might be overly complex or miss cases where gaps are at edges (e.g., leading/trailing zeros without 6s get no 3s unless extras trigger).
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the min/max inf handling in internal_even could be brittle if no 6s (defaults to no left/right favoritism).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns), generated by running the program on an unseen test input; it shows consistent application of rules, e.g., odd rows have 6s and 8s (likely from 777 replacements), even rows have base 8s with 6 overrides (e.g., vertical 6s aligning), and 3s on edges of zero gaps near 6s (e.g., row 4 has 3 at pos 8 and 15-16 near 6 at 13; row 18 has multiple 3s framing 6s and gaps).
 * It makes sense overall: Patterns like repeated [8s, 6, 8s] in odd rows propagate 6s down to even rows, zero segments get 3-bounded where adjacent to 6s (e.g., row 2 has 3 at start and near end 6), and extras extend 3s in places like row 10's leading 3s or row 18's paired 3s— this visually suggests connecting or outlining shapes without breaks.
 * No obvious errors: Zeros stay empty, no invalid numbers, width=17 consistent, bottom row (18) has 3s only where has6_last or above influences (e.g., 6s at 3,12 propagate). If incorrect, it might over-extend 3s in wide gaps (unknown without expected output), but it aligns with rule intent for a coherent visual transformation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:24:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements such as empty space (0), lines (8), holes or dips (6), corners or starts/ends (3), and temporary patterns (7)) where even and odd rows are processed differently to simulate structural transformations, such as replacing sequences in content rows and propagating influences like holes (6) to adjacent structure rows to form boundaries or edges (3).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based index 1,3,5,...) are "content" rows processed for patterns like three consecutive 7s, which are replaced by 8-6-8 to introduce a "hole" or dip in a line.
 * Even rows (0-based index 0,2,4,...) are "structure" rows: non-zero cells are initially set to 8 (solid line), but positions aligned with 6s in adjacent odd rows are overridden to 6 (creating vertical alignment for holes), and edges of segments containing 6s are marked as 3 (possibly corners or boundary starts/ends).
 * Boundary handling is crucial: top row (i=0) skips some propagations; bottom row (i=m-1 if even) treats right edge specially if it ends with 8; middle even rows check left/right adjacency to 0s for placing 3s at segment starts/ends if the segment has a 6.
 * Additional edge logic for non-bottom even rows uses min/max positions of 6s in adjacent odd rows to decide left/right 3 placements, with distance-based rules (e.g., if min_a <=4, set position 1 to 3), suggesting asymmetry or specific visual flaring/crowning at edges influenced by hole positions.
 * Subtlety: Segments in even rows are contiguous non-zero runs; 3s are only placed at the very start/end of such runs if they border 0 and the run contains a 6, but only if the end cell is 8 (not already 6).
 * Zero cells act as separators; empty rows (all 0s) may indicate dividers or unused space.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes fixed alternation of even/odd row types starting with even as structure, but grids may have varying heights; also, 7s only appear in odd rows initially.
 * All_six union from above/below ensures bidirectional influence of holes on structure rows.
 * The j-increment in process_content_row skips after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-777 advances by 1.
 * For bottom even row, right-edge 3 only if e==w and last is 8, differing from middle rows' check for out[i][e-1].

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    # In-place replaces 777 with 868 in odd/content rows, skipping after replacement.
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> set[int]:
    # Extracts positions of 6s (holes) for propagation to structure rows.
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```

```python
def find_segments(row: List[int]) -> List[tuple[int, int, bool]]:
    # Helpful for future: identifies contiguous non-zero segments with start/end indices and whether they contain a 6.
    # Not in previous code, but useful for clearer 3-placement logic.
    segments = []
    w = len(row)
    j = 0
    while j < w:
        if row[j] == 0:
            j += 1
            continue
        s = j
        has6 = False
        while j < w and row[j] != 0:
            if row[j] == 6:
                has6 = True
            j += 1
        e = j
        segments.append((s, e, has6))
    return segments
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, 777 replacement, 6-propagation to override 8s, and basic segment-based 3-placement at edges bordering 0s when containing 6s.
 * Worked: process_content_row accurately handles pattern replacement without overlap; get_six_positions enables vertical alignment of holes; initial 8-setting in even rows solidifies structure.
 * Didn't work fully: The additional min/max logic for left/right 3s in non-bottom even rows (e.g., using min_a < min_b to set out[i][0]=3 or out[i][1]=3 if min_a<=4) seems ad-hoc and may over-apply 3s based on hole distances, potentially incorrect for asymmetric hole influences; bottom row's special e==w check for right 3 is handled but may miss if last cell is already 6.
 * The code mutates out in-place but copies input initially, which is good; however, it skips some logic for i==0 and i==m-1 appropriately but has redundant code for bottom/middle 3-placement (could be unified with find_segments-like logic).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (process_content_row, get_six_positions) are relevant and correct for their purposes, though the main program could benefit from extracting segment finding to reduce duplication.
 * Training successes suggest core pattern replacement and propagation work, but test reveals potential issues in edge flaring (3 placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, mostly 17 columns) shows processed structure (even) and content (odd) rows with 8s dominant, 6s aligned vertically in places (e.g., column 10 in rows 1/2, column 13-14 in rows 3/4), and 3s at various edges/starts (e.g., left 3 in row 2 col0, right 3s in row 4 cols15-16, isolated 3 in row 8 col16).
 * Does not look fully correct: Several 3 placements seem erroneous or over-applied, e.g., row 4 (even, index 4) has 3 at col0, col8 (odd position, possibly from segment start), and clustered 3s at cols15-16 which may violate "only at bordering 0 if 8" rule—row 4 ends with 3,3 but input likely has non-zero run; compare to expected where 3s should only mark true corners without clustering. Row 10 (even, index 10) starts with 3,3 at cols0-1, suggesting the min_a<=4 logic wrongly set col1 to 3 despite no bordering 0 or segment start. Row 16 has 3 at col16 but the row seems full 8/6 without clear end-border 0, indicating bottom-row special case misfired. Overall, vertical 6 alignments look correct (e.g., col4 in rows 8/9), but 3s appear too frequent on left/right, possibly from flawed min/max distance rules creating unintended "flares"; this mismatches expected cleaner boundaries around hole-influenced segments. Anomalies like empty row 5 (all 0s) preserved correctly, but row 18 (odd? wait, output has 19 rows, possibly including extra) ends abruptly with 3s that don't align with above 6s in col3/12.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 21:25:11] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 21:28:28] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components
Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs (1 and 2), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties that appear in **every** example (both train inputs/outputs) and involve clear cause-effect or transformation relationships (e.g., one element's property directly influencing another's in the output). I focused solely on components with detectable links via color, position, shape, or grouping; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., empty spaces, which show no consistent transformation or interaction) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation is included. Where a transformation cannot be explained consistently (e.g., exact repositioning rules), it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Dark Red (Input) → Pink (Output) via Color Change**
   - **Description**: All Dark Red components in inputs consistently transform to Pink components in outputs. No other colors change (Green remains Green; Maroon remains Maroon). This is a direct color mapping: Dark Red exclusively becomes Pink, preserving total pixels across all such components (3 pixels per unit → 3 pixels per unit, with 100% of input Dark Red pixels accounted for in output Pinks).
   - **Consistency**: Present in both train pairs; no exceptions or partial changes.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color property affects output color (input color → output color).

#### 2. **Dark Red Position (Input x-bbox) → Pink Position (Output x-bbox) via Center Extraction**
   - **Description**: The horizontal x-position of each input Dark Red (bbox=[x_start, y, x_end, y], always width=3 pixels) determines the exact x-position of the corresponding output Pink via the center point (x_center = x_start + 1). This x_center becomes the fixed x-coordinate for the output Pink's vertical bbox (e.g., [x_center, y_start, x_center, y_end]).
     - Example (consistent in both): Input Dark Red at [3,1,5,1] (center x=4) → Output Pink at x=4 (e.g., [4,0,4,2]).
   - **Consistency**: Every Dark Red in both inputs has a matching Pink in the output at the exact derived x-center; no mismatches or unpaired components.
   - **Interaction Type**: Input position (x-center) → output position (x-fixed). No y-position link from input Dark Red x to output (y is determined separately, see below).

#### 3. **Dark Red Grouping by Input y-Row → Pink Grouping by Output y-Block via Sequential Assignment**
   - **Description**: Dark Red components are grouped by their input y-row (always odd y=1,3,5,...), and this group is assigned to a corresponding output y-block of height=3 units (y_block_start = (input_y // 2) * 2, spanning y_block_start to y_block_start + 2). All Dark Reds in one input y-group become Pinks in the same output y-block, preserving order and count within the group.
     - The number of Dark Reds per input y-group equals the number of Pinks per output y-block (e.g., 3 Dark Reds at y=5 → 3 Pinks in y=4 to 6).
     - Specific intra-group x-ordering within the y-block is preserved (left-to-right in input → left-to-right in output y-block).
   - **Consistency**: Every y-group of Dark Reds in both inputs maps directly to the predicted y-block in outputs; total groups and counts match perfectly (e.g., input 6 groups → output 6 y-blocks in train 2; input ~6 groups → output ~6 y-blocks in train 1).
   - **Interaction Type**: Input position (y-row grouping) + count → output position (y-block start/end) + count. This creates a layered "movement" where input vertical stacking affects output vertical stacking.

#### 4. **Dark Red Shape (Horizontal, pixels=3) → Pink Shape (Vertical, pixels=3) via Orientation Flip**
   - **Description**: Each input Dark Red (always horizontal: height=1, width=3 pixels, bbox y-span=0) transforms to a vertical Pink (width=1, height=3 pixels, bbox x-span=0). Pixels are preserved exactly (3 in → 3 out), but the shape rotates 90 degrees (horizontal bar becomes vertical bar).
   - **Consistency**: Every Dark Red follows this exact shape change in both outputs; no variations in size or holes (all holes=0 preserved).
   - **Interaction Type**: Input shape properties (orientation, dimensions) → output shape properties (orientation flip, dimensions swap). Edges/silhouette (straight horizontal line) affects output edges/silhouette (straight vertical line).

#### 5. **Total Pixels per Color (All Components) → Total Pixels per Color (All Components) via Preservation**
   - **Description**: For Green and Maroon (unchanged colors), the aggregate pixels across all components of that color are preserved exactly from input to output (e.g., all Green pixels sum to the same total; all Maroon pixels sum to the same total). This applies globally, not per-component.
     - Green: Input singles (1 pixel each) → output shorts/singles (1-2 pixels each), but total unchanged.
     - Maroon: Input horizontal bars → output multi-cell bboxes (varying shapes), but total pixels unchanged.
   - **Consistency**: Exact pixel totals match in both train pairs for Green and Maroon (e.g., ~12 Green pixels input/output in train 1; ~117 Maroon pixels input/output in train 1). Dark Red/Pink also preserves via the per-unit mapping above.
   - **Interaction Type**: Aggregate property (total pixels across color) affects output aggregate (preservation). Individual component shapes/positions for Green/Maroon show rearrangement, but specific rules (e.g., how input Green borders map to output Green shorts) are unknown—no consistent per-component link detectable.

#### Unknown or Non-Consistent Interactions
- **Green Position/Shape Details**: Input Greens (vertical border singles at x=0 and x=max_width for even y-rows) rearrange to output Greens (often horizontal shorts at left/right edges or single cells near Pinks), preserving total pixels but with unknown exact mapping (e.g., no consistent x/y derivation from input positions). Appears to "frame" output y-blocks, but not explainable consistently across both examples.
- **Maroon Position/Shape Details**: Input Maroon horizontals (full-row fills at even y) expand into output Maroon multi-row bboxes (often vertical spans avoiding Pinks), preserving total pixels but with unknown rules (e.g., no detectable position-to-position link; bboxes sometimes overlap input areas but not consistently).
- **Grid Width**: Input max x+1 (~15-18) matches output max x+1, suggesting overall structure preservation, but no direct component interaction (e.g., no color or shape ties it).
- **Empty Spaces/Gaps**: Present in both inputs/outputs as unfilled areas between components, but no consistent transformation (e.g., gaps do not map to specific new gaps or affect colors/shapes predictably).
- No other properties (e.g., holes—all 0, no variation; silhouettes beyond orientation flip) show interactions. No black/purple elements in data, despite description.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:28:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components
Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs (1 and 2), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties that appear in **every** example (both train inputs/outputs) and involve clear cause-effect or transformation relationships (e.g., one element's property directly influencing another's in the output). I focused solely on components with detectable links via color, position, shape, or grouping; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., empty spaces, which show no consistent transformation or interaction) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation is included. Where a transformation cannot be explained consistently (e.g., exact repositioning rules), it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Dark Red (Input) → Pink (Output) via Color Change**
   - **Description**: All Dark Red components in inputs consistently transform to Pink components in outputs. No other colors change (Green remains Green; Maroon remains Maroon). This is a direct color mapping: Dark Red exclusively becomes Pink, preserving total pixels across all such components (3 pixels per unit → 3 pixels per unit, with 100% of input Dark Red pixels accounted for in output Pinks).
   - **Consistency**: Present in both train pairs; no exceptions or partial changes.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color property affects output color (input color → output color).

#### 2. **Dark Red Position (Input x-bbox) → Pink Position (Output x-bbox) via Center Extraction**
   - **Description**: The horizontal x-position of each input Dark Red (bbox=[x_start, y, x_end, y], always width=3 pixels) determines the exact x-position of the corresponding output Pink via the center point (x_center = x_start + 1). This x_center becomes the fixed x-coordinate for the output Pink's vertical bbox (e.g., [x_center, y_start, x_center, y_end]).
     - Example (consistent in both): Input Dark Red at [3,1,5,1] (center x=4) → Output Pink at x=4 (e.g., [4,0,4,2]).
   - **Consistency**: Every Dark Red in both inputs has a matching Pink in the output at the exact derived x-center; no mismatches or unpaired components.
   - **Interaction Type**: Input position (x-center) → output position (x-fixed). No y-position link from input Dark Red x to output (y is determined separately, see below).

#### 3. **Dark Red Grouping by Input y-Row → Pink Grouping by Output y-Block via Sequential Assignment**
   - **Description**: Dark Red components are grouped by their input y-row (always odd y=1,3,5,...), and this group is assigned to a corresponding output y-block of height=3 units (y_block_start = (input_y // 2) * 2, spanning y_block_start to y_block_start + 2). All Dark Reds in one input y-group become Pinks in the same output y-block, preserving order and count within the group.
     - The number of Dark Reds per input y-group equals the number of Pinks per output y-block (e.g., 3 Dark Reds at y=5 → 3 Pinks in y=4 to 6).
     - Specific intra-group x-ordering within the y-block is preserved (left-to-right in input → left-to-right in output y-block).
   - **Consistency**: Every y-group of Dark Reds in both inputs maps directly to the predicted y-block in outputs; total groups and counts match perfectly (e.g., input 6 groups → output 6 y-blocks in train 2; input ~6 groups → output ~6 y-blocks in train 1).
   - **Interaction Type**: Input position (y-row grouping) + count → output position (y-block start/end) + count. This creates a layered "movement" where input vertical stacking affects output vertical stacking.

#### 4. **Dark Red Shape (Horizontal, pixels=3) → Pink Shape (Vertical, pixels=3) via Orientation Flip**
   - **Description**: Each input Dark Red (always horizontal: height=1, width=3 pixels, bbox y-span=0) transforms to a vertical Pink (width=1, height=3 pixels, bbox x-span=0). Pixels are preserved exactly (3 in → 3 out), but the shape rotates 90 degrees (horizontal bar becomes vertical bar).
   - **Consistency**: Every Dark Red follows this exact shape change in both outputs; no variations in size or holes (all holes=0 preserved).
   - **Interaction Type**: Input shape properties (orientation, dimensions) → output shape properties (orientation flip, dimensions swap). Edges/silhouette (straight horizontal line) affects output edges/silhouette (straight vertical line).

#### 5. **Total Pixels per Color (All Components) → Total Pixels per Color (All Components) via Preservation**
   - **Description**: For Green and Maroon (unchanged colors), the aggregate pixels across all components of that color are preserved exactly from input to output (e.g., all Green pixels sum to the same total; all Maroon pixels sum to the same total). This applies globally, not per-component.
     - Green: Input singles (1 pixel each) → output shorts/singles (1-2 pixels each), but total unchanged.
     - Maroon: Input horizontal bars → output multi-cell bboxes (varying shapes), but total pixels unchanged.
   - **Consistency**: Exact pixel totals match in both train pairs for Green and Maroon (e.g., ~12 Green pixels input/output in train 1; ~117 Maroon pixels input/output in train 1). Dark Red/Pink also preserves via the per-unit mapping above.
   - **Interaction Type**: Aggregate property (total pixels across color) affects output aggregate (preservation). Individual component shapes/positions for Green/Maroon show rearrangement, but specific rules (e.g., how input Green borders map to output Green shorts) are unknown—no consistent per-component link detectable.

#### Unknown or Non-Consistent Interactions
- **Green Position/Shape Details**: Input Greens (vertical border singles at x=0 and x=max_width for even y-rows) rearrange to output Greens (often horizontal shorts at left/right edges or single cells near Pinks), preserving total pixels but with unknown exact mapping (e.g., no consistent x/y derivation from input positions). Appears to "frame" output y-blocks, but not explainable consistently across both examples.
- **Maroon Position/Shape Details**: Input Maroon horizontals (full-row fills at even y) expand into output Maroon multi-row bboxes (often vertical spans avoiding Pinks), preserving total pixels but with unknown rules (e.g., no detectable position-to-position link; bboxes sometimes overlap input areas but not consistently).
- **Grid Width**: Input max x+1 (~15-18) matches output max x+1, suggesting overall structure preservation, but no direct component interaction (e.g., no color or shape ties it).
- **Empty Spaces/Gaps**: Present in both inputs/outputs as unfilled areas between components, but no consistent transformation (e.g., gaps do not map to specific new gaps or affect colors/shapes predictably).
- No other properties (e.g., holes—all 0, no variation; silhouettes beyond orientation flip) show interactions. No black/purple elements in data, despite description.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:45:30] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a rule-based grid transformation puzzle, likely simulating a visual logic or matching game (e.g., similar to a match-3 or pattern-filling puzzle) where an input grid of numbers (0 for empty/zeros, 7 for "pink" elements, 8 for background/fillers, etc.) is processed row-by-row to generate an output grid. Odd rows handle replacements of triple-7 patterns with [8,6,8] (introducing "pink" 6s), while even rows start with 8s, preserve 0s, propagate 6s vertically from adjacent odd rows, and strategically place 3s at segment boundaries, edges, or near 0s based on conditions like zero counts, previous row patterns, and segment analysis to enforce puzzle rules like boundary marking or scoring.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, i.e., rows 1,3,5...): Scan for consecutive [7,7,7] triples and replace them directly with [8,6,8]; non-matching positions copy the input value. This introduces vertical "pink" columns (6s) that propagate to even rows above/below, but only if the even row is within a 3-row window starting from the even row preceding the odd row (e.g., for odd row r=1, affects even rows 0,1,2 but clipped to grid height).
 * Even rows (0,2,4...): Initialize to all 8s, then overlay input 0s (preserving empties). Propagate 6s to positions derived from centers of [7,7,7] in the nearest odd row above (or below if applicable), ensuring no duplicates per row.
 * Placement of 3s in even rows: Highly conditional and subtle—skipped entirely for row 0 (first even row). For other even rows:
   * If no 0s (num_zeros == 0) and row >=2: Use previous odd row's [7,7,7] centers to determine left/right edge placements (e.g., place 3s at columns 0-1 if leftmost center <=4; at width-2 to width-1 if rightmost >= width-5). Special override for the "last end" even row (derived from the lowest odd row with 7s): If previous centers are centrally placed (min >4 and max < width-5), force 3s only at absolute edges (0 and width-1).
   * If 0s present (or fallback): Identify non-zero segments (runs of 8s/6s), but only process those containing at least one 6. For each such segment: Place 3 at start if it's at edge (col 0) or adjacent to a 0 on left; place 3 at end if adjacent to 0 on right and the gap from the segment's last 6 to end >=3.
   * Global right-end handling: If the rightmost segment ends at width-1 and contains a 6, force 3 at width-1. Additionally, for trailing non-zero segments without 6s but after a 0, check if any 6 exists left of the preceding 0—if yes, force 3 at width-1.
 * Last red (lowest odd row with any 7): Used to compute a "last even end" row (last_red//2 *2 +2), which triggers special central-to-edge 3 placement if no 0s and previous centers are middle-only.
 * Edge cases: Grid height/width vary (test is 19 rows x 17 cols); handle j < width-2 for triple scans to avoid index errors; no 3s in row 0; propagation clips to grid bounds; assumes input has no other numbers besides 0,7,8 (others copy as-is in odd rows).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical 6 propagation is not direct above/below but offset by row//2 *2 start, spanning 3 rows; 3 placements depend on segment *having* a 6 (skips pure-8 segments); gap >=3 for end-3 only if post-last-6; trailing no-6 segment after 0 gets end-3 only if prior 6s exist anywhere left; special "no zeros middle" for last end avoids over-placing 3s centrally.
 * All considerations: Preserve 0s exactly; 6s only from valid [7,7,7] centers (j+1 position); segments defined as consecutive non-0s post-6/0 placement; left-3 always if segment starts after 0 or at 0; right-3 conditional on adjacency and gap; no overwriting of 0s or 6s with 3s; handle empty grid or no 7s (last_red=-1, no special end).

No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt—the core logic for scanning triples, propagating 6s, and conditional 3s is functional and relevant, though the no-zeros case has nested special rules that could be refactored for clarity. The segment finder is essential for zero-present cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of odd-row [7,7,7] to [8,6,8] replacement, 6 propagation, 0 preservation, and basic 3 boundary placement.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is robust (direct replacement without errors); even row 6 placement correctly derives from pink centers and avoids overlaps; segment-based 3s work for cases with 0s (e.g., left-3 after 0, right-3 with gap>=3); no-zeros edge 3s based on prev centers align with left/right extensions; special last-end override prevents over-central 3s.
 * What didn't work/missed: In no-zeros case, the double-if for left/right (l_min <=4 for cols 0-1; r_max >=width-5 for width-2/-1) may over-place if multiple centers span edges (e.g., if centers at both ends, might duplicate 3s unintentionally, though code doesn't overwrite); trailing no-6 segment after 0 checks "any prior 6 left of the 0" but scans entire left (inefficient, but correct); potential miss in test for row 10 (0-based even row 10): places 3 at col 0 (edge), col 9 (possibly segment end before 0 at 10?), and col 16 (right end), but if expected no 3 at 9 (if segment lacks sufficient gap or no prior 6), it over-places—unknown if mismatch without expected output; row 18 has 3 at col 6 (possibly erroneous if not a valid left-3 or gap), 3 at 8 (after 0 at 7, but as left of next segment?), suggesting possible bug in consecutive 0/segment handling or rightmost logic applying too broadly; row 4 has 3 at col 8 (immediately after 0 at 7, as left-3) and col 16 (right end), which seems correct, but 3 at 16 might be forced despite no trailing check needed.
 * extract_objects equivalent (pink centers finder) is essential for 6 propagation and no-zeros 3s; the last_red finder is key for special end-row handling.
 * No irrelevant functions; all code ties to puzzle (no broken parts, but monolithic structure misses modularity for debugging subtleties like gap calculations).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output mostly makes sense and aligns with inferred rules: Odd rows correctly show [8,6,8] patterns (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10; row 12 has 6 at 10; row 16 has 6s at 3,7,12), 0s preserved in even rows (e.g., row 1 all 0s except 8,6,8 at 9-11; row 14 has 0s with 8,6,8 at 6-8), 6s propagated vertically (e.g., col 10 has 6s in rows 1,3,13,15 aligning with odd-row pinks), and 3s at boundaries (e.g., row 4: 3 after 0 at col8 start, 3 at end col16; row 10: 3 at start col0, 3 before 0 at col9?, 3 at end; row 18: 3s at edges, around central 0 at col7).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots: Row 10 has 3 at col9 (position before 0 at10), but if this is a short segment without gap>=3 from last6 or no prior6 left of the 0, it might be invalid over-placement (expected perhaps no 3 there, leaving 8); row 18 has 3 at col6 (possibly a right-3 from prior segment ending before 0? but followed by 0 at7 then 3 at8 as left-3, suggesting correct adjacency but potential double-3 if segments merge incorrectly); row 4's 3 at col8 is correct as left after 0, but trailing 3 at16 seems forced by rightmost-has6, which is good, but if test expects no end-3 without 0 adjacency, it's a mismatch. Overall, core patterns (6s, 0s, edge 3s) look correct, but segment-end 3s in mid-0 areas (e.g., col9 in row10, col6/8 in row18) may violate gap or has6 conditions—unknown exact expectation, but differs from a "cleaner" boundary-only placement without internal 3s near isolated 0s. Account for test's taller grid (19 rows) by ensuring last_red/end propagation doesn't clip or misapply specials to non-final rows.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (ensuring consistency across both train examples; test input not used for pattern identification, only noted for potential extension), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably affect or transform into each other in every train example. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., isolated Greens without clear ties, varying Maroon spans without direct causation) are included. Unknowns (e.g., exact rules for Maroon merging or Green placement) are noted as such rather than speculated.

#### 1. **Dark Red Components → Pink Components (Direct Transformation via Position and Orientation)**
   - **Description**: Each Dark Red horizontal bar in the input (always 3 pixels wide, positioned at odd y-coordinates, no holes) consistently transforms into a corresponding Pink vertical bar in the output. This is a one-to-one mapping per Dark Red instance.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - **Color**: Dark Red (input) → Pink (output).
     - **Position (x-coordinate)**: Center x-position of the input Dark Red bar (calculated as midpoint of its bbox, e.g., bbox [3,1,5,1] → center x=4) directly determines the exact x-position of the output Pink bar (single-column vertical at that x).
     - **Position (y-coordinate)**: The odd y of the input Dark Red determines the vertical span of the output Pink, which covers from the nearest even y above (inclusive) to the nearest even y below (inclusive), creating a 3-pixel-high vertical (e.g., Dark Red at y=1 → Pink spans y=0 to y=2).
     - **Shape/Orientation**: Horizontal rectangle (width=3, height=1) → Vertical rectangle (width=1, height=3). Pixel count remains 3 (area preserved).
     - **Consistency**: Holds in every train example. All Dark Red instances map uniquely; number and positions match exactly (e.g., Train 1: 11 Dark Red → 11 Pink; Train 2: 6 Dark Red → 6 Pink). No exceptions or unmapped Dark Red.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The Dark Red acts as a "seed" or indicator that enforces a vertical divider/barrier in the output, changing orientation and color while preserving positional essence. No other input elements (e.g., Maroon or Green) directly alter this mapping.
   - **Unknown**: Why the color shifts to Pink (possible semantic role like "active wall," but not inferable from data alone).

#### 2. **Input Maroon Horizontal Bars → Output Maroon Larger Blocks (Merging via Position and Pink Influence)**
   - **Description**: Input Maroon horizontal bars (thin, 1-pixel high, spanning variable widths at even y-coordinates) consistently merge into larger, multi-row Maroon blocks in the output. Merging occurs vertically across adjacent even y-levels but is interrupted/separated by the positions of the new Pink verticals (from above interaction).
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - **Color**: Maroon (input) → Maroon (output); no change.
     - **Position (y-coordinate)**: Even y-positions of input Maroon bars stack vertically into output blocks, spanning multiple rows (e.g., input Maroon at y=0,2,4 → output block covering y=0-4 or similar, unless split).
     - **Position (x-coordinate) and Pink Interaction**: Output Maroon blocks are bounded on left/right by either image edges (x=0 or x=max width) or Pink vertical positions. Input Maroon spans at a given even y directly influence the x-extent of output blocks at that y-level (e.g., a full-span input Maroon at y=2 becomes part of an output block extending x=1 to near-max, split at Pink x-positions like x=6 and x=13).
     - **Shape/Size**: Multiple thin horizontals (pixels variable per bar, e.g., 14-17 pixels each) → Single larger connected block (pixels summed and expanded, e.g., Train 1 total input Maroon ~150 pixels → output Maroon blocks totaling ~150+ pixels, with bbox heights >1). Gaps in input Maroon (e.g., missing x-segments at even y) consistently prevent full merging, creating separate output blocks or edges for Green (see below).
     - **Consistency**: Holds in every train example. All input Maroon contribute to output Maroon; no Maroon pixels are lost or ignored. Pink positions (derived from Dark Red) consistently act as "dividers" that segment the merging (e.g., Train 2: Pinks at x=4,12 split a potential full-width merge into left/center/right blocks).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Input Maroon provide the "base material" for vertical stacking, but their interaction with Pink positions (indirect via Dark Red) enforces boundaries, transforming lines into filled areas. Gaps in input Maroon x-spans consistently create "breaks" that limit block width.
   - **Unknown**: Exact pixel filling within output Maroon bboxes (e.g., why pixels=7 for bbox [0,0,3,2] when 4x3=12; possibly partial fill, but consistent across examples without clear rule).

#### 3. **Input Green Side Markers and Maroon Gaps → Output Green Markers (Boundary Placement)**
   - **Description**: Input Green single-pixel markers (always at x=0 and x=max width, at even y) and gaps in Maroon horizontals consistently influence small Green markers in the output, which appear as boundaries or edge indicators around Maroon blocks.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - **Color**: Green (input) → Green (output); no change.
     - **Position (x-coordinate)**: Input Greens at x=0 and x=max consistently map to output Greens at or near x=0-1 and x=(max-1)-max (e.g., [0,2,0,2] input → [0,2,1,2] output, extending to 2-pixel horizontal).
     - **Position (y-coordinate) and Maroon Gap Interaction**: Output Greens appear at even y where input has side Greens or Maroon gaps (e.g., Train 1 y=8 gap at x=15 → output Green near x=14 y=8). They often span 1-2 pixels horizontally at even y, aligning with Maroon block edges.
     - **Shape/Size**: Single-pixel verticals (input, pixels=1) → Small horizontals or singles (output, pixels=1-2). Limited expansion, not full verticals.
     - **Consistency**: Holds in every train example. All input Greens influence output edge Greens; Maroon gaps always correlate with nearby output Greens (e.g., Train 2 no gaps → fewer internal Greens, but side ones preserved). No output Greens without input Green or gap tie.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Input Greens and Maroon gaps "preserve" boundaries in output, preventing Maroon from extending to image edges and creating explicit markers. Pink positions indirectly affect this by defining where edge Greens start/stop relative to blocks.
   - **Unknown**: Precise extension rule (e.g., why some output Greens are 2-pixel horizontals vs. singles; consistent but not fully predictable from position alone without solving).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no direct hole count effects as all=0; no color-to-color without position tie; no irrelevant elements like varying widths without causation). These connections are positional and transformative, with Dark Red/Pink as the primary "trigger" affecting Maroon/Green indirectly.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:47:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (ensuring consistency across both train examples; test input not used for pattern identification, only noted for potential extension), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably affect or transform into each other in every train example. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., isolated Greens without clear ties, varying Maroon spans without direct causation) are included. Unknowns (e.g., exact rules for Maroon merging or Green placement) are noted as such rather than speculated.

#### 1. **Dark Red Components → Pink Components (Direct Transformation via Position and Orientation)**
   - **Description**: Each Dark Red horizontal bar in the input (always 3 pixels wide, positioned at odd y-coordinates, no holes) consistently transforms into a corresponding Pink vertical bar in the output. This is a one-to-one mapping per Dark Red instance.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - **Color**: Dark Red (input) → Pink (output).
     - **Position (x-coordinate)**: Center x-position of the input Dark Red bar (calculated as midpoint of its bbox, e.g., bbox [3,1,5,1] → center x=4) directly determines the exact x-position of the output Pink bar (single-column vertical at that x).
     - **Position (y-coordinate)**: The odd y of the input Dark Red determines the vertical span of the output Pink, which covers from the nearest even y above (inclusive) to the nearest even y below (inclusive), creating a 3-pixel-high vertical (e.g., Dark Red at y=1 → Pink spans y=0 to y=2).
     - **Shape/Orientation**: Horizontal rectangle (width=3, height=1) → Vertical rectangle (width=1, height=3). Pixel count remains 3 (area preserved).
     - **Consistency**: Holds in every train example. All Dark Red instances map uniquely; number and positions match exactly (e.g., Train 1: 11 Dark Red → 11 Pink; Train 2: 6 Dark Red → 6 Pink). No exceptions or unmapped Dark Red.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The Dark Red acts as a "seed" or indicator that enforces a vertical divider/barrier in the output, changing orientation and color while preserving positional essence. No other input elements (e.g., Maroon or Green) directly alter this mapping.
   - **Unknown**: Why the color shifts to Pink (possible semantic role like "active wall," but not inferable from data alone).

#### 2. **Input Maroon Horizontal Bars → Output Maroon Larger Blocks (Merging via Position and Pink Influence)**
   - **Description**: Input Maroon horizontal bars (thin, 1-pixel high, spanning variable widths at even y-coordinates) consistently merge into larger, multi-row Maroon blocks in the output. Merging occurs vertically across adjacent even y-levels but is interrupted/separated by the positions of the new Pink verticals (from above interaction).
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - **Color**: Maroon (input) → Maroon (output); no change.
     - **Position (y-coordinate)**: Even y-positions of input Maroon bars stack vertically into output blocks, spanning multiple rows (e.g., input Maroon at y=0,2,4 → output block covering y=0-4 or similar, unless split).
     - **Position (x-coordinate) and Pink Interaction**: Output Maroon blocks are bounded on left/right by either image edges (x=0 or x=max width) or Pink vertical positions. Input Maroon spans at a given even y directly influence the x-extent of output blocks at that y-level (e.g., a full-span input Maroon at y=2 becomes part of an output block extending x=1 to near-max, split at Pink x-positions like x=6 and x=13).
     - **Shape/Size**: Multiple thin horizontals (pixels variable per bar, e.g., 14-17 pixels each) → Single larger connected block (pixels summed and expanded, e.g., Train 1 total input Maroon ~150 pixels → output Maroon blocks totaling ~150+ pixels, with bbox heights >1). Gaps in input Maroon (e.g., missing x-segments at even y) consistently prevent full merging, creating separate output blocks or edges for Green (see below).
     - **Consistency**: Holds in every train example. All input Maroon contribute to output Maroon; no Maroon pixels are lost or ignored. Pink positions (derived from Dark Red) consistently act as "dividers" that segment the merging (e.g., Train 2: Pinks at x=4,12 split a potential full-width merge into left/center/right blocks).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Input Maroon provide the "base material" for vertical stacking, but their interaction with Pink positions (indirect via Dark Red) enforces boundaries, transforming lines into filled areas. Gaps in input Maroon x-spans consistently create "breaks" that limit block width.
   - **Unknown**: Exact pixel filling within output Maroon bboxes (e.g., why pixels=7 for bbox [0,0,3,2] when 4x3=12; possibly partial fill, but consistent across examples without clear rule).

#### 3. **Input Green Side Markers and Maroon Gaps → Output Green Markers (Boundary Placement)**
   - **Description**: Input Green single-pixel markers (always at x=0 and x=max width, at even y) and gaps in Maroon horizontals consistently influence small Green markers in the output, which appear as boundaries or edge indicators around Maroon blocks.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - **Color**: Green (input) → Green (output); no change.
     - **Position (x-coordinate)**: Input Greens at x=0 and x=max consistently map to output Greens at or near x=0-1 and x=(max-1)-max (e.g., [0,2,0,2] input → [0,2,1,2] output, extending to 2-pixel horizontal).
     - **Position (y-coordinate) and Maroon Gap Interaction**: Output Greens appear at even y where input has side Greens or Maroon gaps (e.g., Train 1 y=8 gap at x=15 → output Green near x=14 y=8). They often span 1-2 pixels horizontally at even y, aligning with Maroon block edges.
     - **Shape/Size**: Single-pixel verticals (input, pixels=1) → Small horizontals or singles (output, pixels=1-2). Limited expansion, not full verticals.
     - **Consistency**: Holds in every train example. All input Greens influence output edge Greens; Maroon gaps always correlate with nearby output Greens (e.g., Train 2 no gaps → fewer internal Greens, but side ones preserved). No output Greens without input Green or gap tie.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Input Greens and Maroon gaps "preserve" boundaries in output, preventing Maroon from extending to image edges and creating explicit markers. Pink positions indirectly affect this by defining where edge Greens start/stop relative to blocks.
   - **Unknown**: Precise extension rule (e.g., why some output Greens are 2-pixel horizontals vs. singles; consistent but not fully predictable from position alone without solving).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no direct hole count effects as all=0; no color-to-color without position tie; no irrelevant elements like varying widths without causation). These connections are positional and transformative, with Dark Red/Pink as the primary "trigger" affecting Maroon/Green indirectly.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:03:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids with numbers like 0 (gaps/empty), 3 (potential markers), and 7 (likely line segments or connectors) are processed to output a new grid marking structures: 8's for filled frames/walls, 6's for "pink" connection points (e.g., on triple 7 patterns), and 3's for corner or endpoint markers, with distinct rules for even (frame) rows and odd (data) rows to simulate visual assembly like circuits, frames, or linked objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (data rows, indexed 1,3,...) are scanned for consecutive triples of 7's to place a central 6 (pink) with flanking 8's, and vertically propagate 6's to adjacent even rows at the same column, skipping ahead by 3 columns after matches to avoid overlap.
 * Even rows (frame rows, indexed 0,2,...) are filled with 8's where input is non-zero (except 0's stay 0), but 3's are overlaid based on gap presence: no gaps lead to edge or adjacent-to-pink 3's (e.g., left/right of first/last pink, or full edges for bottom row); gaps trigger 3's at transitions from 8 to 0 or where input has 3 and output would be 8.
 * Subtle vertical interactions: 6's in odd rows influence 3 placements in even rows above/below via checks on adjacent 8's and pinks in neighboring rows (e.g., for internal no-gap rows, check i-1 row for 8 next to 6).
 * Bottom row (last even i) has special no-gap handling (just edge 3's if 8) vs. gap handling (3's right before gaps from left, plus right edge).
 * Gaps are detected per even row via any 0 in input; internal gap rows also check input 3's directly for overriding 8's to 3's at edges.
 * Easy to miss: j-indexing must handle width boundaries (e.g., p-1 >=0, q+1 <width); propagation only if ii-1/ii+1 in bounds; no 3 placements on top row (i==0); incremental j+=1 or j+=3 in odd row loop to cover all without overlap.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes modular structure detection (e.g., triple 7's as units) and conditional filling/marking to avoid over-writing (e.g., 3's only if underlying is 8, not on existing 6 or 0).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure out grid initializes to 0's; handle empty grid edge case; no modifications to odd rows beyond initial pink/8 placements (no 3's there); vertical 6 propagation only at pink columns, not flanks.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new types or functions introduced in this attempt; the core logic is inline in the main function. Previous attempts might have benefited from a helper to detect triples:

```python
def find_triple_sevens(row: List[int], width: int) -> List[int]:
    """Returns starting indices of consecutive 7-7-7 triples in row."""
    starts = []
    j = 0
    while j < width - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j+1] == 7 and row[j+2] == 7:
            starts.append(j)
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
    return starts
```

This could replace the inline while loop in odd rows for clarity, but the current inline version works fine and is not broken.

No unhelpful functions noted; the logic avoids extraneous tools like full object extraction, as the puzzle is row-wise procedural rather than holistic blob detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled training example 1 and 2, correctly placing 6's on triple 7's, filling 8's in even rows based on non-zero input, and overlaying 3's for edges/gaps/pink adjacencies without over-writing.
 * Worked well: Odd row triple detection and vertical 6 propagation; even row gap detection via any(0); basic filling of 8's where input !=0.
 * Did not work or potential issues: In complex test cases with multiple pinks/gaps per row, the 3 placement logic for internal no-gap rows relies on min/max pink positions and checks like out[i-1][p+1]==6, which might miss if pinks are not aligned or if adjacent row checks fail boundary conditions (e.g., p=0 or q=width-1); bottom gap handling scans left-to-right for 0 followed by 8 but may not catch rightmost transitions symmetrically.
 * Earlier attempts (inferred from code evolution) likely missed vertical propagation or gap-based 3's, but this version incorporates them, passing training.
 * No extraction functions used or needed, as puzzle is rule-based per row pair, not object-oriented; avoid blob-extraction helpers as they overcomplicate simple pattern matching.
 * Subtle miss in prior logic (possibly): For internal no-gap, 3's are placed at row[0]/row[1] or row[width-1]/row[width-2] only if conditions on first/last pink hold, which might skip if no pinks or misaligned—training passed, but test may expose.
 * Overall, core row alternation and pattern skipping (j+=3) are solid; unhelpful would be global searches ignoring row types.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, width=17) shows consistent 8/6/3/0 placements: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 with 8's at 9/11, matching triple 7 pattern; vertical 6's propagate to row 0/2 at col 10/13; row 2 (even) has 3's at 0/1 and 15/16? Wait, output shows [3,3,8,...6,8,8,6,8,8,8]—3's at start, but logic for i=2 (internal) with possible gaps needs check.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 [3,8,8,...3,0,8,...6,8,8,3], the 0 at col 7 with 8 at col 8 suggests a gap transition, but 3 is not placed at col 7 (stays 0) or immediately before—logic for internal gap should place 3 at j-1 if row_in[j]==0 and out[j-1]==8, but here if input has 0 at 7 and 8 at 8, it should set out[7-1? wait j=7]==3? Scanning shows no 3 at col 6/7, instead 3 at col 6? Wait, row 4 starts 3,8,8,...3,0,8— the 3 before 0 might be misplaced if input 3 there, but vertical from row 3's 6 at col 13 affects row 4 col 13=6, ok; however, end has 3 at col 16, correct for edge.
 * Missing or incorrect: Row 10 [3,8,8,...3,0,8,...8,3] has 0 at col 10 with 8 at 11, but no 3 at col 10 (0) or col 9? Logic should place 3 at j=10 if row_in[10]==0 and out[10]==0 and out[9]==8, but output has 3 at col 9? Wait, [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3]—yes, 3 at col 9 before 0 at 10, then 8 at 11, so it caught the transition at j=10 (set out[9]=3); seems correct there.
 * Looks partially correct but suspicious in row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8]—multiple 6's, no 3's, assuming no gaps and internal, but if adjacent to pinks in row 15/17, might need 3's near them (e.g., near col 3/7/12 6's, check for left/right 8's next to upper 6's); output has no 3's, which might miss if conditions like out[15][j-1]==6 trigger edge 3's.
 * Row 18 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] has 0 at col 7, 3 at col 8 (after 0?), and 3 at end— for bottom row (i=18? assuming height=19 even), gap handling should place 3 at j+1 if row_in[j]==0 and out[j]==0 and out[j+1]==8, so for j=7 (0) and out[8]==8, set out[8]=3, yes matches; but why 0 at 7 stays 0, correct. Overall, most placements align with logic, but potential under-placement of 3's in no-gap internals (e.g., row 6 [8,8,...8] all 8's, no 3's despite possible pinks above/below at col 7).
 * The test output makes sense for simple cases but may not handle all subtle vertical pink-to-3 interactions, leading to missing edge 3's in multi-structure grids; differences from expected: fewer 3's near clustered pinks (e.g., row 8 ends with 3,3 but logic might place only if conditions met—unknown if input triggers).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 22:03:58] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs/outputs and test input (without attempting to solve or interpret the overall puzzle mechanics), the following are the **only obvious, consistent interactions/connections** observed across **every example** (train 1, train 2, and test 1). These are limited to elements that directly interact or affect each other in a repeatable way, such as through position, color, shape, or size transformations. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., all holes=0 with no variation or effect; variable grid widths without consistent impact; isolated Maroon segments without direct ties to other changes) are excluded. No high-level patterns or solutions are inferred—only direct, verifiable links are listed. Unknowns (e.g., exact merging rules for Maroon beyond basic reconfiguration around transforms) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Dark Red Horizontal Bars → Pink Vertical Bars (Core Transformation Interaction)**
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input/output pair; every Dark Red bar in inputs directly corresponds to exactly one Pink bar in outputs, with no extras or misses.
   - **Color Interaction**: Dark Red (input interrupting elements) → Pink (output elements). This color shift is consistent for all such bars; no other colors transform this way.
   - **Position Interaction**: 
     - Input: Horizontal bar at row `r` (always odd-numbered rows: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17), spanning columns `c-1` to `c+1` (center at column `c`).
     - Output: Vertical bar at column `c` (same center column), spanning rows `r-1` to `r+1` (shifted up by 1 row, covering the input row and adjacent even rows above/below).
     - Effect: The input position precisely determines the output position; no deviations across examples.
   - **Shape/Orientation Interaction**: Horizontal (width=3, height=1 in input) → Vertical (width=1, height=3 in output). This reorientation is consistent and tied directly to the position shift.
   - **Size Interaction**: Pixels=3 (input) → Pixels=3 (output). Size is preserved but redistributed (horizontal to vertical).
   - **Unknown**: Why this specific row shift (up by 1) or orientation flip occurs—not explainable from data alone, but the mapping is consistent.

#### 2. **Dark Red/Pink Positions → Maroon Region Reconfiguration (Boundary/Interruption Effect)**
   - **Consistency**: In every example, Maroon fills (horizontal strips in inputs) are consistently fragmented or merged in outputs specifically around the positions of transformed Pink bars (derived from Dark Red).
   - **Position Interaction**:
     - Input: Maroon horizontal strips (always on even rows: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) between Green borders, occasionally split.
     - Output: Maroon regions expand into larger, irregular blocks (vertical/horizontal merges), but are always bounded or interrupted exactly at Pink positions (e.g., Pinks "cut" or define edges of Maroon bbox).
     - Effect: Pink placements (from Dark Red) directly affect Maroon bbox extensions/merges; Maroon pixels increase overall (e.g., input ~100-200 pixels → output ~100-150+ per block), but only where not overlapping Pink areas.
   - **Shape Interaction**: Horizontal strips (input) → Layered/enclosed blocks (output), with Pink verticals creating divisions or pathways in Maroon areas.
   - **Unknown**: Exact rules for Maroon merging (e.g., why some splits close while others persist)—consistent effect on boundaries, but transformation logic unclear.

#### 3. **Green Borders → Edge Preservation with Minor Extensions (Framing Interaction)**
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example; Green elements always frame the left (col 0) and right (col max, e.g., 15/16/18) edges, unaffected by Dark Red/Pink but interacting with Maroon fills.
   - **Position Interaction**:
     - Input: Single-pixel vertical Greens at col 0 and col max, on even rows (matching Maroon strips).
     - Output: Same edge positions preserved, but occasionally extended horizontally (e.g., bbox widens to 2 pixels, like [0,2,1,2] or [17,6,18,6]), incorporating adjacent space only where Maroon reconfiguration leaves gaps near Pinks.
     - Effect: Green positions constrain Maroon expansions (Maroon never overlaps Green edges); extensions happen consistently near Pink-induced Maroon changes.
   - **Size Interaction**: Pixels=1 (most cases) → Pixels=1 or 2 (output extensions); increase tied to adjacent Maroon/Pink adjustments.
   - **Shape Interaction**: Vertical singles (input) → Occasionally short horizontal stubs (output) at edges.
   - **Unknown**: When/why horizontal extensions occur (e.g., only at certain rows near Pinks)—pattern is consistent but not fully mappable.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no color shifts for Green/Maroon; no hole effects; no standalone position-to-position links without the above; Dark Red/Pink are the only elements with direct transformative ties across all examples). Elements like bottom-row Maroon splits in train 1 appear incidental and not consistently interactive.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 22:05:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

     - Output: Vertical bar at column `c` (same center column), spanning rows `r-1` to `r+1` (shifted up by 1 row, covering the input row and adjacent even rows above/below).
     - Effect: The input position precisely determines the output position; no deviations across examples.
   - **Shape/Orientation Interaction**: Horizontal (width=3, height=1 in input) → Vertical (width=1, height=3 in output). This reorientation is consistent and tied directly to the position shift.
   - **Size Interaction**: Pixels=3 (input) → Pixels=3 (output). Size is preserved but redistributed (horizontal to vertical).
   - **Unknown**: Why this specific row shift (up by 1) or orientation flip occurs—not explainable from data alone, but the mapping is consistent.

#### 2. **Dark Red/Pink Positions → Maroon Region Reconfiguration (Boundary/Interruption Effect)**
   - **Consistency**: In every example, Maroon fills (horizontal strips in inputs) are consistently fragmented or merged in outputs specifically around the positions of transformed Pink bars (derived from Dark Red).
   - **Position Interaction**:
     - Input: Maroon horizontal strips (always on even rows: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) between Green borders, occasionally split.
     - Output: Maroon regions expand into larger, irregular blocks (vertical/horizontal merges), but are always bounded or interrupted exactly at Pink positions (e.g., Pinks "cut" or define edges of Maroon bbox).
     - Effect: Pink placements (from Dark Red) directly affect Maroon bbox extensions/merges; Maroon pixels increase overall (e.g., input ~100-200 pixels → output ~100-150+ per block), but only where not overlapping Pink areas.
   - **Shape Interaction**: Horizontal strips (input) → Layered/enclosed blocks (output), with Pink verticals creating divisions or pathways in Maroon areas.
   - **Unknown**: Exact rules for Maroon merging (e.g., why some splits close while others persist)—consistent effect on boundaries, but transformation logic unclear.

#### 3. **Green Borders → Edge Preservation with Minor Extensions (Framing Interaction)**
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example; Green elements always frame the left (col 0) and right (col max, e.g., 15/16/18) edges, unaffected by Dark Red/Pink but interacting with Maroon fills.
   - **Position Interaction**:
     - Input: Single-pixel vertical Greens at col 0 and col max, on even rows (matching Maroon strips).
     - Output: Same edge positions preserved, but occasionally extended horizontally (e.g., bbox widens to 2 pixels, like [0,2,1,2] or [17,6,18,6]), incorporating adjacent space only where Maroon reconfiguration leaves gaps near Pinks.
     - Effect: Green positions constrain Maroon expansions (Maroon never overlaps Green edges); extensions happen consistently near Pink-induced Maroon changes.
   - **Size Interaction**: Pixels=1 (most cases) → Pixels=1 or 2 (output extensions); increase tied to adjacent Maroon/Pink adjustments.
   - **Shape Interaction**: Vertical singles (input) → Occasionally short horizontal stubs (output) at edges.
   - **Unknown**: When/why horizontal extensions occur (e.g., only at certain rows near Pinks)—pattern is consistent but not fully mappable.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no color shifts for Green/Maroon; no hole effects; no standalone position-to-position links without the above; Dark Red/Pink are the only elements with direct transformative ties across all examples). Elements like bottom-row Maroon splits in train 1 appear incidental and not consistently interactive.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

[2025-10-01 22:22:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows process groups of three 7s into 8-6-8 patterns (with surrounding zeros), even rows place 6s at vertical centers from adjacent odd rows and fill non-zero areas with 8s or 3s based on adjacency to zeros and border conditions, aiming to create a coherent visual structure like a stylized image or diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other starting from row 1): Initialize to zeros, then replace every non-overlapping group of three consecutive 7s with 8-6-8; isolated or partial 7s remain zero; centers of these groups (the middle 6 position) are collected for vertical alignment.
 * Even rows (0-based indexing, every other starting from row 0): Place 6s at column positions matching collected centers from the nearest odd rows above/below; default non-zero input cells (from original grid) to 8 unless overridden; special top row (r=0) sets all non-zero non-6 to 8 without further adjacency checks.
 * Adjacency to zeros in even rows: For segments between zeros, if a segment adjacent to a zero contains a 6, set the edge cell(s) of that segment (closest to the zero) to 3 instead of 8; this applies differently for bottom row (only forward/after) vs. internal rows (both directions); zeros themselves stay zero.
 * Border extensions in even rows: For left/right edges, if no zeros in prefix/suffix and certain center position conditions hold (e.g., min/max centers from adjacent rows satisfy inequalities like upper <= lower for left), extend 3s into the border (position 0 or cols-1, and possibly one more if distance <=4); if condition holds but zero present, retain original input value.
 * Subtleties: Overlapping or skipped 7 groups in odd rows advance i by 1 if not exact three 7s, potentially leaving gaps as zero; 6 placements in even rows use set union from adjacent centers, ignoring duplicates; INF=100 as sentinel for missing centers; right border condition always true for bottom row or if lower max center <= upper max; code assumes rectangular grid with cols fixed; potential off-by-one in segment bounds (e.g., seg_end_b = c-1 could be negative); no handling for cols <3 in odd row groups.
 * Key considerations across attempts: Preserve original zeros in even rows unless overridden; non-6 non-zero defaults to 8 but can become 3 via adjacency or border rules; centers only from exact 7-7-7 groups, not partial; vertical alignment prioritizes nearest odd rows; border logic uses min/max centers for "stretching" decisions, with left/right asymmetry (e.g., left uses min centers comparison, right uses max); potential for multiple 6s per row leading to sorted list for first/last; no diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond centers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Main transformation function (core of the attempt, handles all rules)
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (full code as provided; it's the primary tool for grid processing)
    # Extracts centers implicitly via loop over odd rows
    # Uses sets for efficient 6 position lookups
    # No separate types, but assumes g is List[List[int]] with uniform cols
```

```python
# Implicit center extraction (embedded in main function, helpful for vertical alignment)
def extract_centers_odd_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    centers = [[] for _ in range(rows)]
    for r in range(1, rows, 2):
        i = 0
        cols = len(g[0])
        while i < cols - 2:
            if g[r][i] == 7 and g[r][i + 1] == 7 and g[r][i + 2] == 7:
                centers[r].append(i + 1)
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
    return centers
# This is helpful for isolating the 7-group detection and center collection
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid understanding of odd-row 7-to-8-6-8 replacement, center-based 6 placement in even rows, default 8 filling, and basic zero-adjacency 3 overrides.
 * Worked well: Precise non-overlapping group detection in odd rows (advancing i+=3 only on matches), set-based 6 positions for efficiency, top-row simplification (no adjacency checks), and border extensions using min/max centers with conditions like k_upper_l <= k_lower_l.
 * Did not work or incomplete: Adjacent zero rules in even rows have potential bugs in segment calculation (e.g., has_six_b checks max(0, seg_start_b) but seg_end_b could be -1 unhandled; next segment min(cols-1, seg_end_a) may clip incorrectly); bottom row only applies forward 3s, but code uses r == rows-1 check which assumes 0-based indexing correctly; border left/right extensions set to 3 even if original was non-zero, potentially overriding without preservation; no handling for empty centers (uses INF or -1 sentinels, but comparisons like -1 <= something may fail subtly); right border condition "(r + 1 >= rows) or (k_lower_r <= k_upper_r)" is always true for bottom but uses max centers which could misalign if no lower centers.
 * extract_centers_odd_rows (derived from code) is essential and correct for vertical 6 placement; main program loop for even rows adjacency is helpful but buggy in edge cases (e.g., z_idx loop assumes sorted zero_pos, which it is via list comp).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all embedded logic is relevant, though the complex while loop for zero segments could be refactored for clarity (not broken, just dense).
 * General: Code assumes all rows have same cols (no validation); INF=100 works but arbitrary (could use float('inf')); no output validation (e.g., ensure no leftover 7s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (18x17 grid) mostly makes sense and follows the code's logic: Odd rows show 8-6-8 patterns where expected (e.g., row 1 [index 1]: zeros except 8-6-8 at cols 9-11; row 3: 8-6-8 at 12-14), even rows have 6s at aligned centers (e.g., row 0 col 10=6 from row1 center; row 2 col10=6 and col13=6 from row1/3), defaults to 8s in non-zero areas, and 3s near zeros or borders (e.g., row 2 starts with 3s, ends with 6-8; row 4 has 3s at edges and near zero at col7).
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 (even, internal), there's a 0 at col7 but adjacent segments set to 3 only at col8? (code sets output[r][8]=3, but expected might propagate more or handle isolated zero differently; unclear without input, but output has 8-0-3 which may violate "edge to zero" if segment before/after has 6); row 10 (even) has 3-3 at start but then 8s jumping to 0 at col10 (keeps zero, but border left extension sets col0-1=3, seems correct but if input had non-zero there, override might be wrong); row 16 (even, near bottom) has 3-3 at start and end, with 6s at cols3,7,12 but code's right extension sets col16=3 only if cond and no suffix zero—output has 3 at end, plausible but if suffix had zero, should retain input (unknown without input); overall, scattered 0s in even rows are preserved, but some 3 placements look asymmetric (e.g., row 8 ends with 3 but no clear suffix zero); row 18? (last line seems cut off or extra, but assuming 18 rows total); the output visually resembles a pattern (perhaps a figure or map) but has inconsistencies like isolated 6s without vertical alignment in some spots (e.g., row 6 col7=6 but check adjacent odd centers); without test input grid, hard to verify exactly, but differences suggest bugs in segment has_six checks or border conds leading to missed 3s or extra 8s.

- **Grid structure**: Multi-row (approximately 6-8 rows) and multi-column layout forming a rectangular frame, with consistent vertical green borders on left and right sides across all images.
- **Background color**: Predominantly maroon (dark red/purple) filling horizontal strips or bands in each row.
- **Black elements**: Solid black rectangular blocks or bars, varying in width (short to full-row spanning) and positioned horizontally or vertically, creating dividers, frames, or paths; appear as opaque obstacles or lines.
- **Purple/magenta elements**: Solid purple rectangular blocks, typically shorter than black ones, placed within maroon backgrounds, often aligned horizontally and acting as accents or fillers between black sections.
- **Green elements**: Thin vertical green strips or borders enclosing the overall figure; occasional small green accents or extensions at edges, but minimal internal use.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 22:22:53] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Grid structure**: Multi-row (approximately 6-8 rows) and multi-column layout forming a rectangular frame, with consistent vertical green borders on left and right sides across all images.
- **Background color**: Predominantly maroon (dark red/purple) filling horizontal strips or bands in each row.
- **Black elements**: Solid black rectangular blocks or bars, varying in width (short to full-row spanning) and positioned horizontally or vertically, creating dividers, frames, or paths; appear as opaque obstacles or lines.
- **Purple/magenta elements**: Solid purple rectangular blocks, typically shorter than black ones, placed within maroon backgrounds, often aligned horizontally and acting as accents or fillers between black sections.
- **Green elements**: Thin vertical green strips or borders enclosing the overall figure; occasional small green accents or extensions at edges, but minimal internal use.
- **Spatial arrangement**: Overlapping or adjacent colored rectangles forming layered patterns, with empty (transparent/white) spaces implied between blocks; progression from structured rows in inputs to more fragmented or maze-like in output, but all share modular block-based composition without text or icons.

[2025-10-01 22:24:54] Response:
### Identified Consistent Interactions and Connections

Based on analysis of the two training examples (input/output pairs), the following interactions are obvious and consistent across **both** examples. These focus solely on elements with clear, repeatable connections or effects (e.g., positional or transformational links). No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Interactions not present in every example, or those without clear cause-effect (e.g., exact Maroon merging rules, full Green placements), are noted as unknown. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon strips without impact on other components) are excluded.

- **Dark Red (input) position → Pink (output) position and orientation transformation**:
  - Horizontal Dark Red rectangles (always width=3 pixels, height=1, holes=0, placed at odd y-coordinates like 1,3,5,7,9,11) consistently transform into vertical Pink rectangles (width=1, height=3 spanning 3 units, pixels=3, holes=0).
  - The center x-coordinate of each input Dark Red directly determines the x-position of the corresponding output Pink (e.g., input bbox [3,1,5,1] center x=4 → output Pink at x=4).
  - The y-position of the input Dark Red determines the vertical span of the output Pink, specifically covering y-1 to y+1 relative to the input y (e.g., input y=1 → output y=0 to 2; input y=3 → output y=2 to 4). This shift and rotation (horizontal to vertical) is identical in both training examples, with one-to-one mapping per Dark Red instance.
  - No other input elements (e.g., Maroon or Green) directly affect this transformation; it is isolated to Dark Red properties (position and size).

- **Input grid width (via Green borders) → Output grid width preservation**:
  - Vertical Green border elements at fixed left (x=0) and right (varying total width, e.g., x=18 in train1, x=15 in train2) in inputs consistently frame the overall layout, and this total width is preserved in outputs (e.g., output elements span to matching right edge like x=18 or x=15).
  - Green elements in outputs often include segments at or near these borders (e.g., thin vertical or short horizontal Greens at x=0 and right edge), suggesting a framing interaction where input border positions constrain output boundary placements. This is consistent but does not affect internal components like Pink.

- **Maroon (input/output) adjacency → Maroon (output) merging or extension**:
  - Adjacent or overlapping Maroon horizontal strips/bands in inputs (predominantly at even y-coordinates, filling between Greens and Dark Reds) consistently result in larger, vertically/tall Maroon rectangles in outputs that fill spaces around Pink and Green elements (e.g., pixels increase from small input strips to 5-42 in outputs).
  - Position of input Maroon gaps (created by Dark Reds) affects output Maroon bbox extensions, where outputs merge Maroon to border or enclose Pinks (e.g., input Maroon at y=0,2,4,... leads to output Maroon spanning multiple y-levels adjacent to Pinks). This adjacency-based filling is consistent, but the exact aggregation rule (e.g., how specific gaps combine) is unknown.

### Unknown or Inconsistent Elements
- **Green internal placements and transformations**: Input Greens are mostly thin vertical borders with no internal variation, but output Greens include short horizontal segments (e.g., width=2, pixels=2 at even y) or split verticals (e.g., at non-border x like 14). No clear consistent mapping from input Green positions to output (e.g., appears in varying spots possibly tied to Maroon gaps, but not repeatable across examples without variation). Cannot identify interaction; marked as unknown.
- **Pixel count effects**: Input pixels for Dark Red (always 3) directly match output Pink pixels (3), suggesting a size preservation interaction, but Maroon pixel changes (e.g., from 14-17 to 5-42) lack a consistent formula (e.g., no direct sum or multiplication rule evident). Unknown beyond adjacency.
- **Holes property**: All elements have holes=0 in both inputs and outputs across examples; no interaction or effect observed (irrelevant as it remains constant without variation).
- **Background color shifts**: No consistent color change interaction beyond Dark Red → Pink; Maroon remains Maroon, Green remains Green. Any other color effects (e.g., no Purple in data despite description) are absent or inconsistent.

No other connections (e.g., shape silhouettes, edge counts, or color-to-movement effects) are obvious or consistent in every example. Analysis limited to provided data; no assumptions for test input.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 22:24:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where input grids with numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) represent frames and content areas; the goal is to transform the grid by replacing patterns in content rows (odd indices) and adjusting frame rows (even indices) to draw borders with 3s, place 6s based on adjacent content, fill with 8s, and handle zeros/segments specially, likely simulating some kind of enclosed drawing or puzzle visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Content rows (odd indices) must scan for consecutive 7-7-7 patterns and replace them specifically with 8-6-8, skipping ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlaps; this seems to "draw" vertical elements or supports in content.
 * Frame rows (even indices) collect 6 positions from adjacent content rows (above and below) and place 6s there, but only if the frame cell isn't already non-zero (avoids overwriting).
 * Borders on upper frames use 3s conditionally: left/right edges get 3s if the first/last 6 from above is within 4 positions of the edge or if the row has any zero; this seems intended to extend borders inward but is over-triggering in attempts.
 * Closing 3s: For non-bottom frames, place a 3 left of any zero if the zero is after the max 6 position; this handles "gaps" but is applying too broadly, creating unwanted borders.
 * Bottom frame is special: Treat zeros as segment dividers, and for each segment (between zeros), place a left 3 only if it contains a 6; always place a rightmost 3; if no zeros, it's a single segment with left 3 only if it has a 6.
 * Zeros represent empty/unfilled areas that shouldn't extend frames; frames should be full 8s where no content influence, but attempts add 3s too aggressively, especially on edges without justification.
 * Subtlety: Frames don't always border on every edge—e.g., top frames may not need left/right 3s if content 6s are centered, and bottom handles segments to avoid over-bordering empty parts.
 * Has_zero flag in upper borders seems to force edge 3s if any zero exists, but this is too loose and causes mismatches (e.g., adding 3s where expected is 8).
 * Max_six for closing only applies after max 6, but in attempts, it leads to 3s in wrong places like mid-row.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal bordering: 3s only where needed to close/enclose 6-influenced areas, not blanket edges; 8s fill everything else in frames.
 * Easy to miss: No overwriting of existing non-zeros in frames; bottom segment logic must skip empty segments (start > end).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., w=19 in ex1, w=16 in ex2), so code must be width-agnostic; assume all rows same length.
 * Process content first, then frames top-to-bottom, but upper frames look at above content only for borders (below for 6s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import inf

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for replacing 7 patterns in content rows to create vertical 6 supports.)

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> set:
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```
(Useful for extracting 6 positions from content to propagate to frames.)

```python
def place_sixes(row: List[int], six_pos: set) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in six_pos:
        if 0 <= j < w and row[j] != 0:
            row[j] = 6
```
(Helpful for safely placing 6s in frames without overwriting non-zeros, but note: the condition row[j] != 0 might be too strict if frames start as 0s everywhere.)

The main program structure (copy grid, process odd rows first, then even rows with 6 propagation and border logic) is a good skeleton, but border/closing functions are flawed.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def handle_upper_frame_borders(out: List[List[int]], i: int, six_pos_above_first: int, six_pos_above_last: int, has_zero: bool) -> None:
    # ... (as in code)
```
(This is broken: over-places 3s on edges if has_zero is true anywhere in row, leading to extra borders; the <=4 condition doesn't align with examples where centered content leaves edges as 8.)

```python
def handle_closing_threes(row: List[int], six_pos: set, max_six: int) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in range(w):
        if row[j] == 0 and max_six <= j and j > 0:
            row[j - 1] = 3
```
(This is unhelpful/broken: applies closing 3s too early and without segment awareness, creating mid-frame borders where expected is continuous 8s; ignores right-side symmetry.)

```python
def handle_bottom_frame(out: List[int], i: int, six_pos: set) -> None:  # Note: param is List[int], should be List[List[int]]
    # ... (as in code)
```
(Broken: param type error (out is grid, but func takes List[int]); segment logic misses some cases like no left 3 for empty segments, and always adds right 3 even for empty full row; in ex1, it generates correct-ish bottom but with wrong left 3s in segments.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it partially succeeds: content row processing (7->8-6-8) appears correct in both trainings (e.g., 6s placed where expected in odd rows), and 6 propagation to frames works (matches 6 positions in evens).
 * What worked: Pattern replacement in content is accurate; collecting 6s from adjacent rows is right; bottom segment detection identifies zeros correctly in some cases (e.g., ex1 bottom has 8,8,0,3... matching expected start).
 * What didn't work: Frame borders over-place 3s, e.g., in train1 row0 (top frame), generated [3,8,...3] vs expected [8,8,...8]—no reason for edge 3s since content below starts 6s centered; similarly, row2 [3,3,8...] vs [3,3,8...] wait, actually row2 left 3s match but right ends with 3 vs 8.
 * Train1 mismatches: Row0 full edges 3s (wrong, should be 8s); row4 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row6 right [3,3] matches but left over-3? Wait, left [3,3] matches; row8 [3,8,...3] matches but internal 3 at pos15 wrong (expected no 3 there, it's 3,0,8,8,3 but generated has 3 before 0); row10 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row12 [8,8,0,3,...] matches expected [8,8,0,3,...].
 * Train2 mismatches: Row0 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row2 right [8,3] vs [8,8]; row4 [3,8,...3,3] vs [8,8,...3,3] (left 3 wrong); row6 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row8 [3,3,...3,3] matches; row10 [3,8,...3] vs expected [3,8,...3] wait, but expected ends 8,3? Wait, generated ends 8,3 matching, but left 3 might be extra.
 * General issue: has_zero forces too many edge 3s (e.g., any zero triggers full borders, but examples show edges stay 8 if content doesn't reach edges); closing_threes adds 3s after max_6 even in filled areas.
 * Bottom handling somewhat works but fails empty segments (e.g., adds left 3 where no 6).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs of 6s or enclosures) were attempted, but might be needed for better segment/border decisions—current code lacks holistic view of enclosed areas.
 * Attempts show understanding of alternating row types and 6 propagation, but miss subtlety that 3s are only for actual enclosure edges, not prophylactic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It has excessive 3s on frame edges and internals, e.g., row0 [3,8,...3] likely should be full 8s like train1 top (content below has 6s centered at pos10-11, not near edges); row2 [3,8,...3] probably wrong left 3 (content below sparse); row4 ends [3,3] but has internal 0 without proper closing; row6 [3,8,...3] vs likely [8,8,...8]; row10 [3,3,...3] has early left 3s and internal 3 before 0; row12 [3,8,...3] wrong edges; row14 [3,8,...3] wrong; row16 [3,8,...3] wrong; row18 [3,8,...0,3,...3] has 0 with 3 before but possibly wrong internal 3 at pos8.
 * Mentally simulating rules on test input (assuming similar to trains: input has 7s in odds replaced to 6s, frames start 0s): After content process, odds will have 6s at specific spots (e.g., row1 likely 6 at 10-11, row3 at 13-14, etc.); frames should propagate those 6s and add 3s only to enclose (e.g., left 3 only if 6 near left, no blanket edges); bottom row18 should segment on 0 at ~pos7 and pos? , adding 3s per has_6 but generated has extra 3 at pos8 and ends 3 correctly but left likely wrong. Overall, output looks over-bordered, missing continuous 8 fills where no enclosure needed—doesn't match inferred correct (more 8-heavy frames like train expects).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing line segments, colors, or structural elements in a diagram like a floor plan or abstract pattern) that undergoes transformation rules to generate a new grid. The rules focus on detecting and modifying patterns in odd rows (e.g., sequences of 7s) and applying conditional overlays (e.g., 3s for edges or boundaries) to even rows based on adjacent "centers," zeros, and positional logic between upper/lower elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by identifying non-overlapping sequences of three consecutive 7s, replacing them with [8, 6, 8] to mark a "center" at the middle position; this skips over the triple to avoid overlap, but misses if 7s are isolated or in pairs.
 * Even rows start with a base layer: positions with 0 stay 0, centers from adjacent odd rows get 6, and all other non-zero positions get 8; this creates a foundational "fill" that gets overlaid.
 * Overlays for even rows vary by position: top rows have no overlays (pure base), bottom rows add 3s to the start of non-zero segments (if base is 8) and always to the end if 8; internal even rows use complex left/right placement logic based on the relative positions of min/max centers from upper and lower odd rows (e.g., place left 3 if no lower centers or if upper min < lower min), plus pre-pending 3 before zeros if adjacent base is 8, and boundary adjustments only if no zeros.
 * Subtle edge cases: Zeros in input rows block or trigger specific 3 placements (e.g., sides always get 3 if zeros present); segments in bottom overlays are contiguous non-zeros, and 3s only apply if the base is 8; centers are sets to handle multiples without overlap.
 * Global considerations: Grid dimensions (m rows, n cols) must be handled dynamically; assume even rows are 0,2,... and odd 1,3,...; no modifications to input zeros except in base; potential for multiple centers per row affecting adjacents; rules seem to simulate "structural supports" or "boundaries" around detected objects (7-triples as holes or features).
 * Easy-to-miss: The left/right placement in internal evens depends on comparative positions of entire center sets (min/max), not individual; if no upper/lower, defaults to full placement; bottom end always gets 3 if 8, regardless of segments; the i+=3 skip in odd processing ensures non-overlapping but may leave trailing 7s untouched if not in triples.
 * All attempts considered: No object extraction needed (rules are row-wise, not holistic); focus on adjacency between odd/even pairs; potential for visual alignment (e.g., 6 as vertical supports, 3/8 as horizontals, 0 as voids); test grids may have irregular zero placements or multiple centers requiring precise min/max logic.

(The overlay functions like apply_internal_even_overlays, apply_bottom_overlays are helpful for specific row types but overly complex; simplify left/right logic if min/max comparisons fail edge cases. No types beyond List[List[int]] needed. No extraction functions for full objects, as rules are local to rows/adjacencies.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row processing (triple 7 detection and replacement) and base even row computation, as evidenced by both training examples passing.
 * Internal even row overlays work for simple cases (e.g., no zeros, single centers) but may mishandle complex min/max comparisons for left/right placement when multiple upper/lower centers overlap or are symmetric, potentially placing 3s incorrectly on boundaries.
 * Bottom row overlays correctly add 3s to segment starts and ends but might over-apply if segments are short (<3) or if zeros interrupt in ways that create unintended 8-to-3 changes before zeros (the pre-pend logic is in internal, not bottom, which could be a miss).
 * Top rows are correctly left as base (no overlays), which is simple and likely right.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core row-wise processing; however, the adj_centers union from upper/lower is essential but assumes centers are only in odd rows (correct per code).
 * The has_zero flag and pre-pending 3 before zeros (in internal) is a good subtlety but only applies if base left is 8, which might miss if zero is at edge.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and correct for non-overlapping triples; process_odd_row is solid but doesn't handle overlapping possibles (though puzzle likely doesn't have them).
 * apply_internal_even_overlays is helpful but convoluted—its place_left/place_right logic based on min/max could be broken for test cases with equal min/max (defaults to False, potentially no side 3s when needed).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though overlay apps could be merged for clarity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns), with visible patterns like repeated [8,8,...,6,8,...] in evens and [0,... ,6,8,...] in odds, plus 3s at edges/segments, which looks visually consistent with a structural overlay puzzle (e.g., 6s as supports under 7-triple centers, 3s as boundaries around voids/0s).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows show processed 6s where triples were, evens have bases with 6s at adj centers and 3s on sides/bottoms; for example, row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10, matching a likely 7-triple, and adjacent evens (rows 0/2) have 6 there with 8s elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots—e.g., row 4 (even, internal?) has 3s at cols 0,6,16 but a 0 at col7, suggesting pre-pend logic applied, but if this is bottom-like, the segment 3s might be over-applied (row 4: [3,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] ends with 3 at col16, but trailing 8s after 0 might need different handling); row 8 (even) has 3s at end [...,3,3] which seems like bottom rule but positionally odd if not bottom row.
 * Differences from expected: Without exact expected output, hard to confirm, but potential issues include extra 3s in internal rows (e.g., row 14: [8,... ,3,3] at end, possibly misplaced if not bottom) or missed 3s before zeros (e.g., row 17: [3,8,8,6,... ,0,3] has 0 at col6? Wait, listed as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,...]—the 0 at col7 followed by 3 at col8 suggests segment start 3, but if base was 8 before 0, why no pre-pend? This indicates the internal pre-pend logic might be broken or not triggered, differing from expected boundary reinforcement).
 * Another mismatch: Row 2 (even) has [3,3,8,... ,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] with leading 3s and internal 6s, but if adj centers are at cols 10 and 13?, the double 3 at start might be over-placement if has_zero=True (many 0s in input?); looks like it places left even with zeros, but expected might skip if lower centers dominate.
 * Overall, test output is plausible (80% match vibe) but likely incorrect in 2-3 rows due to left/right logic or zero-handling subtleties—e.g., row 16 (odd? Wait, output row16: [8,8,8,6,...] seems even-like, but indexing off); needs adjustment for comparative center positions in multi-center tests.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving row-by-row processing of a binary-like grid (using numbers 0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special markers like holes or anchors, 3 for boundary/edge markers, and 7 as a temporary pattern in odd rows). The goal is to transform the input grid by first modifying odd rows to detect and replace patterns of three 7s with an 8-6-8 sequence (indicating a detected "object" or segment with a hole), then updating even rows to fill with 8s everywhere non-zero in the original, place 6s at positions aligned with 6s in adjacent odd rows, and insert 3s at segment edges, gaps, or boundaries to denote closures or starts, while handling top/bottom edges differently.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, i.e., rows 1,3,5...) are pre-processed only for sequences of exactly three consecutive 7s, replacing them with 8-6-8 to mark a "hole" or internal feature; longer or shorter 7 sequences are ignored, and this scan advances by 3 only on match, otherwise by 1.
 * Even rows (0-based indexing, i.e., rows 0,2,4...) start as 8s where original was non-zero (ignoring zeros as gaps), with 6s overlaid from the union of 6 positions in the immediately above and below odd rows (if they exist); top row (i=0) has no above, bottom row (i=m-1 if even) has no below.
 * 3s are placed as "edge closures": for non-top even rows, opening 3s replace leading 8s after a 0-gap if the following segment has a 6; closing 3s replace trailing 8s before a 0-gap if the segment has a 6 (but only for non-bottom rows).
 * Edge 3s (left/rightmost positions): For bottom even rows, left 3 at position 0 if there's a left segment with 6s before the first 0, extending to position 1 if the min 6 is <=4 positions away; similarly right 3 at w-1, extending to w-2 if max 6 is <=4 from end. For internal even rows (not top/bottom), left/right 3s only if both above and below have 6-segments and the upper segment protrudes (min/max mismatch with lower).
 * Subtleties: 3s only apply to segments containing at least one 6 (no 3s for 8-only segments); zeros in original even rows create gaps that split segments but don't propagate 6s across; top row gets no edge 3s; bottom row skips internal closing 3s but gets special edge handling; overlapping 6s from above/below union without conflict; process odd rows first on a copy, then even rows using original for non-zero check but modified odds for 6 positions.
 * Gaps between segments: Internal gaps (zeros) trigger opening/closing 3s only if the adjacent segment has 6s, and scans must handle multiple segments per row without overlapping modifications.
 * Easy to miss: The 7-pattern replacement is greedy but non-overlapping (j+=3 on match); edge extensions for 3s are distance-limited (<=4 positions); no 3s on top row; bottom row's edge 3s use original zeros for "first/last zero" boundaries; internal edge 3s require both adjacent odds to have 6s and protrusion.
 * All considerations: Preserve zeros in even rows initially but override with 8/6/3; no changes to odd rows after initial 7-processing; width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

            row[j + 2] = 8

    """Extracts set of indices where value is 6, useful for unioning above/below influences on even rows."""
    return {j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 6}
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles the 7-to-8-6-8 replacement in odd rows and basic 6 placement in even rows via union of adjacent 6s.
 * Correctly processes training example 1 and 2 fully, indicating core rules for segment filling with 8s, 6 overlays, and basic edge/gap 3s are captured.
 * Handles top row by skipping above 6s and no edge 3s; bottom row skips closing 3s but applies special left/right edge 3s based on first/last zero and proximity (<=4).
 * Internal edge 3s correctly condition on both above/below having 6s and protrusion (min/max mismatch).
 * Gap handling separates opening 3s (after 0 to 8 with 6 in segment) and closing 3s (8 to 0 with 6 in segment), but closing only for non-bottom; scans are careful to skip zeros and process segment-by-segment.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; process_content_row and get_six_positions are essential and correct for detecting 7-patterns and extracting 6 anchors.
 * Potential misses: Edge extensions might over-apply if w is small; internal gap scans could loop inefficiently but work; no handling for overlapping segments or non-uniform w (assumes uniform).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output processes 19 rows (odd count, so last is even? Wait, listed as 19 lines but may be 18+1; assumes m=18 or similar), with odd rows showing 7-replacements (e.g., row 1 has 6 at pos 10, row 3 at 13, row 5 at 13? Wait, output shows modified odds implicitly via evens).
 * Even rows mostly fill with 8s where original non-zero, 6s at union positions (e.g., row 0 has 6 at 10, matching below; row 2 has 6s at 10 and 13; row 4 has 6 at 13, 3 at 8?).
 * 3s appear at edges/gaps: e.g., row 2 starts with 3 (opening after implied gap? But row 2: [3,8,...6 at 10,8,6 at 13,...]); row 4 has 3 at 8 (internal?); row 8 ends with 3; row 10 has 3 at 9; row 14 ends with 3; row 16 has no leading 3 but 6s; row 18 has leading 3s at 0-1, ends with 3s at 15-16.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8], the 3 at position 8 seems like a closing 3 before a 0 at 7? But position 7 is 0, and segment before has no 6 (all 8s from 0-6), so no 3 should be there per rules (3s only for segments with 6); this indicates bug in closing 3 logic applying without 6 check in some gaps. Similarly, row 18 [3,3,8,6,...3,3] has double 3s at start/end, which matches edge extension (<=4 from min/max 6), but if no protrusion or wrong first_zero, it over-applies. Row 10 [8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] has 3 at 9 before 0 at 10, but segment 4-9 has 6 at 4, so closing 3 ok, but why 0 at 10 preserved while later 8s? Expected: more consistent gap handling without stray 0s in output even rows unless original. Overall, core 6/8 placement seems correct, but 3 placements have errors in non-6 segments and possibly bottom edge miscalculation; test mismatches expected by applying 3s to 8-only segments and incorrect internal closings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements such as empty space (0), lines (8), holes or dips (6), corners or starts/ends (3), and temporary patterns (7)) where even and odd rows are processed differently to simulate structural transformations, such as replacing sequences in content rows and propagating influences like holes (6) to adjacent structure rows to form boundaries or edges (3).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based index 1,3,5,...) are "content" rows processed for patterns like three consecutive 7s, which are replaced by 8-6-8 to introduce a "hole" or dip in a line.
 * Even rows (0-based index 0,2,4,...) are "structure" rows: non-zero cells are initially set to 8 (solid line), but positions aligned with 6s in adjacent odd rows are overridden to 6 (creating vertical alignment for holes), and edges of segments containing 6s are marked as 3 (possibly corners or boundary starts/ends).
 * Boundary handling is crucial: top row (i=0) skips some propagations; bottom row (i=m-1 if even) treats right edge specially if it ends with 8; middle even rows check left/right adjacency to 0s for placing 3s at segment starts/ends if the segment has a 6.
 * Additional edge logic for non-bottom even rows uses min/max positions of 6s in adjacent odd rows to decide left/right 3 placements, with distance-based rules (e.g., if min_a <=4, set position 1 to 3), suggesting asymmetry or specific visual flaring/crowning at edges influenced by hole positions.
 * Subtlety: Segments in even rows are contiguous non-zero runs; 3s are only placed at the very start/end of such runs if they border 0 and the run contains a 6, but only if the end cell is 8 (not already 6).
 * Zero cells act as separators; empty rows (all 0s) may indicate dividers or unused space.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes fixed alternation of even/odd row types starting with even as structure, but grids may have varying heights; also, 7s only appear in odd rows initially.
 * All_six union from above/below ensures bidirectional influence of holes on structure rows.
 * The j-increment in process_content_row skips after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-777 advances by 1.
 * For bottom even row, right-edge 3 only if e==w and last is 8, differing from middle rows' check for out[i][e-1].

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    # In-place replaces 777 with 868 in odd/content rows, skipping after replacement.
    j = 0

    j = 0

            j += 1
        e = j
        segments.append((s, e, has6))
    return segments
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, 777 replacement, 6-propagation to override 8s, and basic segment-based 3-placement at edges bordering 0s when containing 6s.
 * Worked: process_content_row accurately handles pattern replacement without overlap; get_six_positions enables vertical alignment of holes; initial 8-setting in even rows solidifies structure.
 * Didn't work fully: The additional min/max logic for left/right 3s in non-bottom even rows (e.g., using min_a < min_b to set out[i][0]=3 or out[i][1]=3 if min_a<=4) seems ad-hoc and may over-apply 3s based on hole distances, potentially incorrect for asymmetric hole influences; bottom row's special e==w check for right 3 is handled but may miss if last cell is already 6.
 * The code mutates out in-place but copies input initially, which is good; however, it skips some logic for i==0 and i==m-1 appropriately but has redundant code for bottom/middle 3-placement (could be unified with find_segments-like logic).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (process_content_row, get_six_positions) are relevant and correct for their purposes, though the main program could benefit from extracting segment finding to reduce duplication.
 * Training successes suggest core pattern replacement and propagation work, but test reveals potential issues in edge flaring (3 placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, mostly 17 columns) shows processed structure (even) and content (odd) rows with 8s dominant, 6s aligned vertically in places (e.g., column 10 in rows 1/2, column 13-14 in rows 3/4), and 3s at various edges/starts (e.g., left 3 in row 2 col0, right 3s in row 4 cols15-16, isolated 3 in row 8 col16).
 * Does not look fully correct: Several 3 placements seem erroneous or over-applied, e.g., row 4 (even, index 4) has 3 at col0, col8 (odd position, possibly from segment start), and clustered 3s at cols15-16 which may violate "only at bordering 0 if 8" rule—row 4 ends with 3,3 but input likely has non-zero run; compare to expected where 3s should only mark true corners without clustering. Row 10 (even, index 10) starts with 3,3 at cols0-1, suggesting the min_a<=4 logic wrongly set col1 to 3 despite no bordering 0 or segment start. Row 16 has 3 at col16 but the row seems full 8/6 without clear end-border 0, indicating bottom-row special case misfired. Overall, vertical 6 alignments look correct (e.g., col4 in rows 8/9), but 3s appear too frequent on left/right, possibly from flawed min/max distance rules creating unintended "flares"; this mismatches expected cleaner boundaries around hole-influenced segments. Anomalies like empty row 5 (all 0s) preserved correctly, but row 18 (odd? wait, output has 19 rows, possibly including extra) ends abruptly with 3s that don't align with above 6s in col3/12.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids with numbers like 0 (gaps/empty), 3 (potential markers), and 7 (likely line segments or connectors) are processed to output a new grid marking structures: 8's for filled frames/walls, 6's for "pink" connection points (e.g., on triple 7 patterns), and 3's for corner or endpoint markers, with distinct rules for even (frame) rows and odd (data) rows to simulate visual assembly like circuits, frames, or linked objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (data rows, indexed 1,3,...) are scanned for consecutive triples of 7's to place a central 6 (pink) with flanking 8's, and vertically propagate 6's to adjacent even rows at the same column, skipping ahead by 3 columns after matches to avoid overlap.
 * Even rows (frame rows, indexed 0,2,...) are filled with 8's where input is non-zero (except 0's stay 0), but 3's are overlaid based on gap presence: no gaps lead to edge or adjacent-to-pink 3's (e.g., left/right of first/last pink, or full edges for bottom row); gaps trigger 3's at transitions from 8 to 0 or where input has 3 and output would be 8.
 * Subtle vertical interactions: 6's in odd rows influence 3 placements in even rows above/below via checks on adjacent 8's and pinks in neighboring rows (e.g., for internal no-gap rows, check i-1 row for 8 next to 6).
 * Bottom row (last even i) has special no-gap handling (just edge 3's if 8) vs. gap handling (3's right before gaps from left, plus right edge).
 * Gaps are detected per even row via any 0 in input; internal gap rows also check input 3's directly for overriding 8's to 3's at edges.
 * Easy to miss: j-indexing must handle width boundaries (e.g., p-1 >=0, q+1 <width); propagation only if ii-1/ii+1 in bounds; no 3 placements on top row (i==0); incremental j+=1 or j+=3 in odd row loop to cover all without overlap.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes modular structure detection (e.g., triple 7's as units) and conditional filling/marking to avoid over-writing (e.g., 3's only if underlying is 8, not on existing 6 or 0).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure out grid initializes to 0's; handle empty grid edge case; no modifications to odd rows beyond initial pink/8 placements (no 3's there); vertical 6 propagation only at pink columns, not flanks.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new types or functions introduced in this attempt; the core logic is inline in the main function. Previous attempts might have benefited from a helper to detect triples:

```python
def find_triple_sevens(row: List[int], width: int) -> List[int]:
    """Returns starting indices of consecutive 7-7-7 triples in row."""
    starts = []
    j = 0
    while j < width - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j+1] == 7 and row[j+2] == 7:
            starts.append(j)
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
    return starts
```

This could replace the inline while loop in odd rows for clarity, but the current inline version works fine and is not broken.

No unhelpful functions noted; the logic avoids extraneous tools like full object extraction, as the puzzle is row-wise procedural rather than holistic blob detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled training example 1 and 2, correctly placing 6's on triple 7's, filling 8's in even rows based on non-zero input, and overlaying 3's for edges/gaps/pink adjacencies without over-writing.
 * Worked well: Odd row triple detection and vertical 6 propagation; even row gap detection via any(0); basic filling of 8's where input !=0.
 * Did not work or potential issues: In complex test cases with multiple pinks/gaps per row, the 3 placement logic for internal no-gap rows relies on min/max pink positions and checks like out[i-1][p+1]==6, which might miss if pinks are not aligned or if adjacent row checks fail boundary conditions (e.g., p=0 or q=width-1); bottom gap handling scans left-to-right for 0 followed by 8 but may not catch rightmost transitions symmetrically.
 * Earlier attempts (inferred from code evolution) likely missed vertical propagation or gap-based 3's, but this version incorporates them, passing training.
 * No extraction functions used or needed, as puzzle is rule-based per row pair, not object-oriented; avoid blob-extraction helpers as they overcomplicate simple pattern matching.
 * Subtle miss in prior logic (possibly): For internal no-gap, 3's are placed at row[0]/row[1] or row[width-1]/row[width-2] only if conditions on first/last pink hold, which might skip if no pinks or misaligned—training passed, but test may expose.
 * Overall, core row alternation and pattern skipping (j+=3) are solid; unhelpful would be global searches ignoring row types.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, width=17) shows consistent 8/6/3/0 placements: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 with 8's at 9/11, matching triple 7 pattern; vertical 6's propagate to row 0/2 at col 10/13; row 2 (even) has 3's at 0/1 and 15/16? Wait, output shows [3,3,8,...6,8,8,6,8,8,8]—3's at start, but logic for i=2 (internal) with possible gaps needs check.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 [3,8,8,...3,0,8,...6,8,8,3], the 0 at col 7 with 8 at col 8 suggests a gap transition, but 3 is not placed at col 7 (stays 0) or immediately before—logic for internal gap should place 3 at j-1 if row_in[j]==0 and out[j-1]==8, but here if input has 0 at 7 and 8 at 8, it should set out[7-1? wait j=7]==3? Scanning shows no 3 at col 6/7, instead 3 at col 6? Wait, row 4 starts 3,8,8,...3,0,8— the 3 before 0 might be misplaced if input 3 there, but vertical from row 3's 6 at col 13 affects row 4 col 13=6, ok; however, end has 3 at col 16, correct for edge.
 * Missing or incorrect: Row 10 [3,8,8,...3,0,8,...8,3] has 0 at col 10 with 8 at 11, but no 3 at col 10 (0) or col 9? Logic should place 3 at j=10 if row_in[10]==0 and out[10]==0 and out[9]==8, but output has 3 at col 9? Wait, [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3]—yes, 3 at col 9 before 0 at 10, then 8 at 11, so it caught the transition at j=10 (set out[9]=3); seems correct there.
 * Looks partially correct but suspicious in row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8]—multiple 6's, no 3's, assuming no gaps and internal, but if adjacent to pinks in row 15/17, might need 3's near them (e.g., near col 3/7/12 6's, check for left/right 8's next to upper 6's); output has no 3's, which might miss if conditions like out[15][j-1]==6 trigger edge 3's.
 * Row 18 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] has 0 at col 7, 3 at col 8 (after 0?), and 3 at end— for bottom row (i=18? assuming height=19 even), gap handling should place 3 at j+1 if row_in[j]==0 and out[j]==0 and out[j+1]==8, so for j=7 (0) and out[8]==8, set out[8]=3, yes matches; but why 0 at 7 stays 0, correct. Overall, most placements align with logic, but potential under-placement of 3's in no-gap internals (e.g., row 6 [8,8,...8] all 8's, no 3's despite possible pinks above/below at col 7).
 * The test output makes sense for simple cases but may not handle all subtle vertical pink-to-3 interactions, leading to missing edge 3's in multi-structure grids; differences from expected: fewer 3's near clustered pinks (e.g., row 8 ends with 3,3 but logic might place only if conditions met—unknown if input triggers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows process groups of three 7s into 8-6-8 patterns (with surrounding zeros), even rows place 6s at vertical centers from adjacent odd rows and fill non-zero areas with 8s or 3s based on adjacency to zeros and border conditions, aiming to create a coherent visual structure like a stylized image or diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other starting from row 1): Initialize to zeros, then replace every non-overlapping group of three consecutive 7s with 8-6-8; isolated or partial 7s remain zero; centers of these groups (the middle 6 position) are collected for vertical alignment.
 * Even rows (0-based indexing, every other starting from row 0): Place 6s at column positions matching collected centers from the nearest odd rows above/below; default non-zero input cells (from original grid) to 8 unless overridden; special top row (r=0) sets all non-zero non-6 to 8 without further adjacency checks.
 * Adjacency to zeros in even rows: For segments between zeros, if a segment adjacent to a zero contains a 6, set the edge cell(s) of that segment (closest to the zero) to 3 instead of 8; this applies differently for bottom row (only forward/after) vs. internal rows (both directions); zeros themselves stay zero.
 * Border extensions in even rows: For left/right edges, if no zeros in prefix/suffix and certain center position conditions hold (e.g., min/max centers from adjacent rows satisfy inequalities like upper <= lower for left), extend 3s into the border (position 0 or cols-1, and possibly one more if distance <=4); if condition holds but zero present, retain original input value.
 * Subtleties: Overlapping or skipped 7 groups in odd rows advance i by 1 if not exact three 7s, potentially leaving gaps as zero; 6 placements in even rows use set union from adjacent centers, ignoring duplicates; INF=100 as sentinel for missing centers; right border condition always true for bottom row or if lower max center <= upper max; code assumes rectangular grid with cols fixed; potential off-by-one in segment bounds (e.g., seg_end_b = c-1 could be negative); no handling for cols <3 in odd row groups.
 * Key considerations across attempts: Preserve original zeros in even rows unless overridden; non-6 non-zero defaults to 8 but can become 3 via adjacency or border rules; centers only from exact 7-7-7 groups, not partial; vertical alignment prioritizes nearest odd rows; border logic uses min/max centers for "stretching" decisions, with left/right asymmetry (e.g., left uses min centers comparison, right uses max); potential for multiple 6s per row leading to sorted list for first/last; no diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond centers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

# Main transformation function (core of the attempt, handles all rules)
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (full code as provided; it's the primary tool for grid processing)
    # Extracts centers implicitly via loop over odd rows
    # Uses sets for efficient 6 position lookups
    # No separate types, but assumes g is List[List[int]] with uniform cols
```

```python
# Implicit center extraction (embedded in main function, helpful for vertical alignment)
def extract_centers_odd_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    centers = [[] for _ in range(rows)]
    for r in range(1, rows, 2):
        i = 0
        cols = len(g[0])
        while i < cols - 2:
            if g[r][i] == 7 and g[r][i + 1] == 7 and g[r][i + 2] == 7:
                centers[r].append(i + 1)
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
    return centers
# This is helpful for isolating the 7-group detection and center collection
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid understanding of odd-row 7-to-8-6-8 replacement, center-based 6 placement in even rows, default 8 filling, and basic zero-adjacency 3 overrides.
 * Worked well: Precise non-overlapping group detection in odd rows (advancing i+=3 only on matches), set-based 6 positions for efficiency, top-row simplification (no adjacency checks), and border extensions using min/max centers with conditions like k_upper_l <= k_lower_l.
 * Did not work or incomplete: Adjacent zero rules in even rows have potential bugs in segment calculation (e.g., has_six_b checks max(0, seg_start_b) but seg_end_b could be -1 unhandled; next segment min(cols-1, seg_end_a) may clip incorrectly); bottom row only applies forward 3s, but code uses r == rows-1 check which assumes 0-based indexing correctly; border left/right extensions set to 3 even if original was non-zero, potentially overriding without preservation; no handling for empty centers (uses INF or -1 sentinels, but comparisons like -1 <= something may fail subtly); right border condition "(r + 1 >= rows) or (k_lower_r <= k_upper_r)" is always true for bottom but uses max centers which could misalign if no lower centers.
 * extract_centers_odd_rows (derived from code) is essential and correct for vertical 6 placement; main program loop for even rows adjacency is helpful but buggy in edge cases (e.g., z_idx loop assumes sorted zero_pos, which it is via list comp).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all embedded logic is relevant, though the complex while loop for zero segments could be refactored for clarity (not broken, just dense).
 * General: Code assumes all rows have same cols (no validation); INF=100 works but arbitrary (could use float('inf')); no output validation (e.g., ensure no leftover 7s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (18x17 grid) mostly makes sense and follows the code's logic: Odd rows show 8-6-8 patterns where expected (e.g., row 1 [index 1]: zeros except 8-6-8 at cols 9-11; row 3: 8-6-8 at 12-14), even rows have 6s at aligned centers (e.g., row 0 col 10=6 from row1 center; row 2 col10=6 and col13=6 from row1/3), defaults to 8s in non-zero areas, and 3s near zeros or borders (e.g., row 2 starts with 3s, ends with 6-8; row 4 has 3s at edges and near zero at col7).
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 (even, internal), there's a 0 at col7 but adjacent segments set to 3 only at col8? (code sets output[r][8]=3, but expected might propagate more or handle isolated zero differently; unclear without input, but output has 8-0-3 which may violate "edge to zero" if segment before/after has 6); row 10 (even) has 3-3 at start but then 8s jumping to 0 at col10 (keeps zero, but border left extension sets col0-1=3, seems correct but if input had non-zero there, override might be wrong); row 16 (even, near bottom) has 3-3 at start and end, with 6s at cols3,7,12 but code's right extension sets col16=3 only if cond and no suffix zero—output has 3 at end, plausible but if suffix had zero, should retain input (unknown without input); overall, scattered 0s in even rows are preserved, but some 3 placements look asymmetric (e.g., row 8 ends with 3 but no clear suffix zero); row 18? (last line seems cut off or extra, but assuming 18 rows total); the output visually resembles a pattern (perhaps a figure or map) but has inconsistencies like isolated 6s without vertical alignment in some spots (e.g., row 6 col7=6 but check adjacent odd centers); without test input grid, hard to verify exactly, but differences suggest bugs in segment has_six checks or border conds leading to missed 3s or extra 8s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a rule-based grid transformation puzzle, likely simulating a visual logic or matching game (e.g., similar to a match-3 or pattern-filling puzzle) where an input grid of numbers (0 for empty/zeros, 7 for "pink" elements, 8 for background/fillers, etc.) is processed row-by-row to generate an output grid. Odd rows handle replacements of triple-7 patterns with [8,6,8] (introducing "pink" 6s), while even rows start with 8s, preserve 0s, propagate 6s vertically from adjacent odd rows, and strategically place 3s at segment boundaries, edges, or near 0s based on conditions like zero counts, previous row patterns, and segment analysis to enforce puzzle rules like boundary marking or scoring.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, i.e., rows 1,3,5...): Scan for consecutive [7,7,7] triples and replace them directly with [8,6,8]; non-matching positions copy the input value. This introduces vertical "pink" columns (6s) that propagate to even rows above/below, but only if the even row is within a 3-row window starting from the even row preceding the odd row (e.g., for odd row r=1, affects even rows 0,1,2 but clipped to grid height).
 * Even rows (0,2,4...): Initialize to all 8s, then overlay input 0s (preserving empties). Propagate 6s to positions derived from centers of [7,7,7] in the nearest odd row above (or below if applicable), ensuring no duplicates per row.
 * Placement of 3s in even rows: Highly conditional and subtle—skipped entirely for row 0 (first even row). For other even rows:
   * If no 0s (num_zeros == 0) and row >=2: Use previous odd row's [7,7,7] centers to determine left/right edge placements (e.g., place 3s at columns 0-1 if leftmost center <=4; at width-2 to width-1 if rightmost >= width-5). Special override for the "last end" even row (derived from the lowest odd row with 7s): If previous centers are centrally placed (min >4 and max < width-5), force 3s only at absolute edges (0 and width-1).
   * If 0s present (or fallback): Identify non-zero segments (runs of 8s/6s), but only process those containing at least one 6. For each such segment: Place 3 at start if it's at edge (col 0) or adjacent to a 0 on left; place 3 at end if adjacent to 0 on right and the gap from the segment's last 6 to end >=3.
   * Global right-end handling: If the rightmost segment ends at width-1 and contains a 6, force 3 at width-1. Additionally, for trailing non-zero segments without 6s but after a 0, check if any 6 exists left of the preceding 0—if yes, force 3 at width-1.
 * Last red (lowest odd row with any 7): Used to compute a "last even end" row (last_red//2 *2 +2), which triggers special central-to-edge 3 placement if no 0s and previous centers are middle-only.
 * Edge cases: Grid height/width vary (test is 19 rows x 17 cols); handle j < width-2 for triple scans to avoid index errors; no 3s in row 0; propagation clips to grid bounds; assumes input has no other numbers besides 0,7,8 (others copy as-is in odd rows).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical 6 propagation is not direct above/below but offset by row//2 *2 start, spanning 3 rows; 3 placements depend on segment *having* a 6 (skips pure-8 segments); gap >=3 for end-3 only if post-last-6; trailing no-6 segment after 0 gets end-3 only if prior 6s exist anywhere left; special "no zeros middle" for last end avoids over-placing 3s centrally.
 * All considerations: Preserve 0s exactly; 6s only from valid [7,7,7] centers (j+1 position); segments defined as consecutive non-0s post-6/0 placement; left-3 always if segment starts after 0 or at 0; right-3 conditional on adjacency and gap; no overwriting of 0s or 6s with 3s; handle empty grid or no 7s (last_red=-1, no special end).

No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt—the core logic for scanning triples, propagating 6s, and conditional 3s is functional and relevant, though the no-zeros case has nested special rules that could be refactored for clarity. The segment finder is essential for zero-present cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of odd-row [7,7,7] to [8,6,8] replacement, 6 propagation, 0 preservation, and basic 3 boundary placement.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is robust (direct replacement without errors); even row 6 placement correctly derives from pink centers and avoids overlaps; segment-based 3s work for cases with 0s (e.g., left-3 after 0, right-3 with gap>=3); no-zeros edge 3s based on prev centers align with left/right extensions; special last-end override prevents over-central 3s.
 * What didn't work/missed: In no-zeros case, the double-if for left/right (l_min <=4 for cols 0-1; r_max >=width-5 for width-2/-1) may over-place if multiple centers span edges (e.g., if centers at both ends, might duplicate 3s unintentionally, though code doesn't overwrite); trailing no-6 segment after 0 checks "any prior 6 left of the 0" but scans entire left (inefficient, but correct); potential miss in test for row 10 (0-based even row 10): places 3 at col 0 (edge), col 9 (possibly segment end before 0 at 10?), and col 16 (right end), but if expected no 3 at 9 (if segment lacks sufficient gap or no prior 6), it over-places—unknown if mismatch without expected output; row 18 has 3 at col 6 (possibly erroneous if not a valid left-3 or gap), 3 at 8 (after 0 at 7, but as left of next segment?), suggesting possible bug in consecutive 0/segment handling or rightmost logic applying too broadly; row 4 has 3 at col 8 (immediately after 0 at 7, as left-3) and col 16 (right end), which seems correct, but 3 at 16 might be forced despite no trailing check needed.
 * extract_objects equivalent (pink centers finder) is essential for 6 propagation and no-zeros 3s; the last_red finder is key for special end-row handling.
 * No irrelevant functions; all code ties to puzzle (no broken parts, but monolithic structure misses modularity for debugging subtleties like gap calculations).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output mostly makes sense and aligns with inferred rules: Odd rows correctly show [8,6,8] patterns (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10; row 12 has 6 at 10; row 16 has 6s at 3,7,12), 0s preserved in even rows (e.g., row 1 all 0s except 8,6,8 at 9-11; row 14 has 0s with 8,6,8 at 6-8), 6s propagated vertically (e.g., col 10 has 6s in rows 1,3,13,15 aligning with odd-row pinks), and 3s at boundaries (e.g., row 4: 3 after 0 at col8 start, 3 at end col16; row 10: 3 at start col0, 3 before 0 at col9?, 3 at end; row 18: 3s at edges, around central 0 at col7).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots: Row 10 has 3 at col9 (position before 0 at10), but if this is a short segment without gap>=3 from last6 or no prior6 left of the 0, it might be invalid over-placement (expected perhaps no 3 there, leaving 8); row 18 has 3 at col6 (possibly a right-3 from prior segment ending before 0? but followed by 0 at7 then 3 at8 as left-3, suggesting correct adjacency but potential double-3 if segments merge incorrectly); row 4's 3 at col8 is correct as left after 0, but trailing 3 at16 seems forced by rightmost-has6, which is good, but if test expects no end-3 without 0 adjacency, it's a mismatch. Overall, core patterns (6s, 0s, edge 3s) look correct, but segment-end 3s in mid-0 areas (e.g., col9 in row10, col6/8 in row18) may violate gap or has6 conditions—unknown exact expectation, but differs from a "cleaner" boundary-only placement without internal 3s near isolated 0s. Account for test's taller grid (19 rows) by ensuring last_red/end propagation doesn't clip or misapply specials to non-final rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines, fills, or shapes in a diagram) where rules transform input patterns, particularly propagating "6" markers vertically and horizontally while modifying edges with "3"s and handling special sequences like three consecutive "7"s in odd rows to create asymmetric or directional effects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content rows) are processed by scanning for sequences of three consecutive 7s and replacing them with [8, 6, 8], which introduces a "6" marker in the middle; this skips ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-7 sequences just increment by 1.
 * Even rows start by converting non-zero cells to 8 (like a base fill), then override positions directly above or below a 6 (from adjacent odd rows) to 6, creating vertical propagation of "6" influences.
 * In even rows, after base filling, identify segments of zeros (empty gaps) and add "3"s to the left or right edges of these segments if the segment contains a 6 nearby; left edges get 3 if above/below 6 favors left (e.g., min position comparison), right edges get 3 conditionally based on max positions or bottom-row presence of 6s, with special handling for the very last segment.
 * Top even row only considers below 6s (no above), bottom even row only considers above 6s and treats it as "is_bottom=True" (no below), internal even rows consider both above and below 6s.
 * Extra rules for even rows: If position 0 is set to 3 and the above min-6 is <=4 positions away, extend 3 to position 1 if it's 8; similarly, if last position is 3 and distance to above max-6 is <=4, extend to second-last if 8— these seem like proximity-based extensions for subtle edge blending.
 * Zeros remain 0 unless overridden, and the process assumes uniform width across rows; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtle: The 3 placements are directional (left-favoring based on min comparisons, right based on max), and bottom row's right-edge logic differs (uses has6_last instead of max comparison); also, the "extras" extensions are asymmetric and only trigger under specific distance thresholds (e.g., <=4), which might handle visual tapering or connection rules.
 * Overall, the rules seem to simulate drawing connections or fills between "object" outlines (8s) with hooks (3s) and markers (6s), possibly for a connect-the-dots or pattern completion puzzle; misses could occur in edge cases like no 6s (inf/-inf mins/maxes), single-row grids, or wide gaps without 6s (no 3s added).
 * Considerations from code: Use sets for 6 positions for efficiency; handle m=1 or m=2 specially to avoid index errors; the segment processing iterates zeros and appends w to catch the end.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt provided, so no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Training example 1 result: CORRECT (program handled the rules accurately for that case).
 * Training example 2 result: CORRECT (demonstrates robustness for varied inputs, like different 7 sequences or 6 propagations).
 * The process_content_row function works well for odd-row 777 replacements but is in-place and assumes no overlapping triples (skips 3 after match, which is correct for non-overlapping).
 * get_six_positions is essential and correct for identifying vertical influences.
 * process_top_even and process_internal_even capture core even-row logic, including 3 placements, but the segment-based 3 logic might be overly complex or miss cases where gaps are at edges (e.g., leading/trailing zeros without 6s get no 3s unless extras trigger).
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the min/max inf handling in internal_even could be brittle if no 6s (defaults to no left/right favoritism).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns), generated by running the program on an unseen test input; it shows consistent application of rules, e.g., odd rows have 6s and 8s (likely from 777 replacements), even rows have base 8s with 6 overrides (e.g., vertical 6s aligning), and 3s on edges of zero gaps near 6s (e.g., row 4 has 3 at pos 8 and 15-16 near 6 at 13; row 18 has multiple 3s framing 6s and gaps).
 * It makes sense overall: Patterns like repeated [8s, 6, 8s] in odd rows propagate 6s down to even rows, zero segments get 3-bounded where adjacent to 6s (e.g., row 2 has 3 at start and near end 6), and extras extend 3s in places like row 10's leading 3s or row 18's paired 3s— this visually suggests connecting or outlining shapes without breaks.
 * No obvious errors: Zeros stay empty, no invalid numbers, width=17 consistent, bottom row (18) has 3s only where has6_last or above influences (e.g., 6s at 3,12 propagate). If incorrect, it might over-extend 3s in wide gaps (unknown without expected output), but it aligns with rule intent for a coherent visual transformation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interactions and Connections

Based on analysis of the two training examples (input/output pairs), the following interactions are obvious and consistent across **both** examples. These focus solely on elements with clear, repeatable connections or effects (e.g., positional or transformational links). No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Interactions not present in every example, or those without clear cause-effect (e.g., exact Maroon merging rules, full Green placements), are noted as unknown. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon strips without impact on other components) are excluded.

- **Dark Red (input) position → Pink (output) position and orientation transformation**:
  - Horizontal Dark Red rectangles (always width=3 pixels, height=1, holes=0, placed at odd y-coordinates like 1,3,5,7,9,11) consistently transform into vertical Pink rectangles (width=1, height=3 spanning 3 units, pixels=3, holes=0).
  - The center x-coordinate of each input Dark Red directly determines the x-position of the corresponding output Pink (e.g., input bbox [3,1,5,1] center x=4 → output Pink at x=4).
  - The y-position of the input Dark Red determines the vertical span of the output Pink, specifically covering y-1 to y+1 relative to the input y (e.g., input y=1 → output y=0 to 2; input y=3 → output y=2 to 4). This shift and rotation (horizontal to vertical) is identical in both training examples, with one-to-one mapping per Dark Red instance.
  - No other input elements (e.g., Maroon or Green) directly affect this transformation; it is isolated to Dark Red properties (position and size).

- **Input grid width (via Green borders) → Output grid width preservation**:
  - Vertical Green border elements at fixed left (x=0) and right (varying total width, e.g., x=18 in train1, x=15 in train2) in inputs consistently frame the overall layout, and this total width is preserved in outputs (e.g., output elements span to matching right edge like x=18 or x=15).
  - Green elements in outputs often include segments at or near these borders (e.g., thin vertical or short horizontal Greens at x=0 and right edge), suggesting a framing interaction where input border positions constrain output boundary placements. This is consistent but does not affect internal components like Pink.

- **Maroon (input/output) adjacency → Maroon (output) merging or extension**:
  - Adjacent or overlapping Maroon horizontal strips/bands in inputs (predominantly at even y-coordinates, filling between Greens and Dark Reds) consistently result in larger, vertically/tall Maroon rectangles in outputs that fill spaces around Pink and Green elements (e.g., pixels increase from small input strips to 5-42 in outputs).
  - Position of input Maroon gaps (created by Dark Reds) affects output Maroon bbox extensions, where outputs merge Maroon to border or enclose Pinks (e.g., input Maroon at y=0,2,4,... leads to output Maroon spanning multiple y-levels adjacent to Pinks). This adjacency-based filling is consistent, but the exact aggregation rule (e.g., how specific gaps combine) is unknown.

### Unknown or Inconsistent Elements
- **Green internal placements and transformations**: Input Greens are mostly thin vertical borders with no internal variation, but output Greens include short horizontal segments (e.g., width=2, pixels=2 at even y) or split verticals (e.g., at non-border x like 14). No clear consistent mapping from input Green positions to output (e.g., appears in varying spots possibly tied to Maroon gaps, but not repeatable across examples without variation). Cannot identify interaction; marked as unknown.
- **Pixel count effects**: Input pixels for Dark Red (always 3) directly match output Pink pixels (3), suggesting a size preservation interaction, but Maroon pixel changes (e.g., from 14-17 to 5-42) lack a consistent formula (e.g., no direct sum or multiplication rule evident). Unknown beyond adjacency.
- **Holes property**: All elements have holes=0 in both inputs and outputs across examples; no interaction or effect observed (irrelevant as it remains constant without variation).
- **Background color shifts**: No consistent color change interaction beyond Dark Red → Pink; Maroon remains Maroon, Green remains Green. Any other color effects (e.g., no Purple in data despite description) are absent or inconsistent.

No other connections (e.g., shape silhouettes, edge counts, or color-to-movement effects) are obvious or consistent in every example. Analysis limited to provided data; no assumptions for test input.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:29:31] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a rule-based cellular automaton-style puzzle on a grid of integers (likely representing visual elements like lines, supports, or shapes in a 2D diagram), where odd rows (content rows) are transformed by pattern replacement, and even rows (structural rows) are updated based on "support" positions marked by 6s from adjacent rows, incorporating protrusions, closures, and edge effects with values like 8 (solid), 6 (support), 3 (cap/protrusion), and 0 (empty/gap).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content) replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, effectively inserting a "support" (6) in the middle of a solid run, but only in non-overlapping triplets; this must be done iteratively without backtracking, so overlapping patterns like 7777 would only catch the first three.
 * Even rows start as all 8s (solids) where input is non-zero, then overlay 6s at positions supported by 6s in adjacent odd rows (above or below); top even row only looks below, bottom only above, internal look both ways and union the sets.
 * Protrusions (3s) on even rows occur at edges if the above 6-range extends beyond the below 6-range (left/right asymmetry), limited to positions 0,1 (left) or w-2,w-1 (right), and only if within 4 units of the extreme 6; this simulates "overhangs" but is capped and conditional on existing 8s.
 * Closing 3s on non-bottom even rows: Scan for contiguous non-zero segments; if a segment contains a 6 and ends with an 8 adjacent to a 0, cap the end with 3 (but only the right end of the segment).
 * Bottom even rows apply symmetric "bottom threes": For each non-zero segment with a 6, cap the start (left) with 3 if it's 8, and the end (right) with 3 if it's 8 and at grid edge.
 * Subtleties: 0s act as gaps/dividers, so processing skips or respects them in segment scans; min/max 6 positions determine asymmetry for protrusions, using inf/-inf for empty sets; no processing if grid empty or single row; copies input to output before mutating.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion logic is asymmetric and distance-limited (≤4 from extreme), potentially missing long overhangs; closing threes only apply to right ends adjacent to 0s, not left or internal; bottom threes cap both ends but only if at edge for right; unions of above/below 6s for internal evens ensure shared supports; iterative j-increment in content processing avoids rechecking modified cells.
 * All rows copied from input initially, but only even rows fully rebuilt; odd rows only get content replacement; width w assumed uniform across rows.
 * Considerations: Handles multi-row grids (m rows), but assumes even number? No, works for odd m; edge cases like no 6s (no protrusions/closures), all 0s (remains 0s), or isolated 6s (may create single 6 segments without 3s).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (and only shown) submission; no prior attempts detailed, but the code structure suggests iterative refinement from simpler row processors to full grid handling.
 * Content row processing works correctly for 777 replacement, as training passed, but may miss if input has non-7 solids or overlaps not handled.
 * Even row logic separates top/internal/bottom well, with union of 6s helpful for shared supports; training success indicates core support overlay and segment scanning are solid.
 * Protrusion function captures asymmetry but is limited to edges +1 position and ≤4 distance, which worked for training but might under-apply in wider test grids with long overhangs.
 * Closing threes only right-cap adjacent to 0s, which is subtle and likely correct per training, but could miss if segments aren't gap-adjacent or lack 6s.
 * Bottom threes symmetric to closing but left+edge-right, helpful for base cases; no known misses here.
 * Overall program flow (process odds first, then evens with dependencies) is essential and correct, as it allows 6s from content to influence structures.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though protrusion distance cap (hardcoded 4) might be a tuning parameter that's puzzle-specific and not general.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (9 even, 10 odd? Wait, listed as 19 lines but alternating), with patterns like long 8-runs interrupted by 6s, edge 3s, and 0-gaps; it looks visually consistent with a structural diagram (e.g., bridges or shapes supported by 6s, capped by 3s), and since training examples passed, it likely makes sense overall.
 * Specific observations: Row 0 (even): Mostly 8s with a 6 at pos 10, no protrusions visible; Row 1 (odd): 0s then 8-6-8 then 0s, post-content process. Row 2: Starts with 3 (protrusion?), has internal 6s at 10 and 13. Seems to apply rules sequentially.
 * Potential issues: In row 4 (even?): 3 at start, 6 at 13, 3s at 15-16 (protrusion or closing?); row 5 all 0s (gap row?). Row 8: 6 at 4 and 7, 3 at end. Row 10: 3s at 0-1 and 9, 6 at 4, 3 at end – shows multiple 3s, possibly over-applying if protrusions + closing overlap without checks.
 * Row 16 (even?): 6s at 3,12, but no 3s shown, yet below has 8-6-8 at 2-4 and 12-14; might miss closing if no adjacent 0. Row 18: 3 at 0 and 7? 6 at 3 and 12, 3 at end – looks like bottom caps + internal.
 * Overall, test output appears mostly correct and rule-compliant (e.g., 6s aligned across rows, 3s at edges/gaps), but subtle differences possible in protrusion application (e.g., why row 2 has leading 3 but not others? Expected if min_u < min_l); no major mismatches observed without expected output, but distance limit might cause under-protrusion in wide sections (e.g., pos 13-16 in row 2 has extra 6 but no extra 3s beyond edge).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 22:29:41] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (ensuring consistency across both), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties that demonstrably affect or transform into other elements in the outputs, without inferring a full puzzle solution. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts not affecting structure, sporadic gaps in Maroon that do not repeat predictably, or non-interacting bbox edges) are excluded. Unknown aspects of transformations are noted explicitly.

1. **Dark Red horizontal segments → Pink vertical segments (color and shape transformation driven by position)**:
   - **Description**: Each Dark Red component in the input (always horizontal, 3 pixels wide, located at odd y-positions) consistently transforms into a corresponding Pink component in the output. The transformation affects color (Dark Red → Pink), orientation (horizontal → vertical), and extent (3 pixels wide at fixed y → 3 pixels high at fixed x).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - Position (x-center of Dark Red bbox) → Position (x of Pink bbox): The central x-position of the input Dark Red (e.g., midpoint of [3,1,5,1] is x=4) directly determines the fixed x-position of the output Pink.
     - Position (y of Dark Red) → Position (y-span of Pink bbox): The y-position of the input Dark Red determines the vertical span of the Pink, extending from y-1 to y+1 (e.g., Dark Red at y=1 → Pink bbox y=0 to 2).
     - Size (pixels=3) → Size (pixels=3): The pixel count is preserved, but reoriented vertically.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every Dark Red instance across both training inputs/outputs (e.g., input 1 has Dark Red at y=1 centers x=4,10 → output Pinks at x=4/10, y=0-2; input 2 has Dark Red at y=7 centers x=3,11 → output Pinks at x=3/11, y=6-8). No exceptions or non-interacting Dark Red elements.
   - **Notes**: This is the only fully explainable transformation. Pink components do not appear in inputs and are absent in outputs where no corresponding Dark Red exists.

2. **Dark Red/Pink positions → Maroon structure (position affecting segmentation and vertical extension)**:
   - **Description**: Positions of input Dark Red (or their output Pink equivalents) consistently influence the bounding boxes and connectivity of Maroon components, causing Maroon horizontals to segment or extend vertically around Pink locations. Maroon remains the same color but reorganizes from sparse horizontals into larger, multi-row spans.
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - Position (x/y of Dark Red/Pink) → Position and extent (Maroon bbox): Pink verticals act as barriers, splitting adjacent Maroon into separate components or forcing vertical extensions where no Pink interrupts (e.g., in input 1, Dark Red at y=5 x=3/8/15 → output Maroon spans like [1,0,6,8] avoid crossing those x at y=4-6; similar in input 2 around y=5 x=6).
     - Absence of Dark Red/Pink → Maroon vertical connectivity: Rows without Dark Red allow Maroon to merge vertically across multiple even/odd y-levels (e.g., input 2 has no Dark Red at y=9-10 → output Maroon [0,4,6,10] spans y=4-10 uninterrupted).
   - **Consistency**: Holds across all Maroon in both training examples, where output Maroon always aligns with (and avoids overlapping) Pink positions, resulting in linear, grid-aligned structures. No Maroon in outputs ignores Pink placements.
   - **Unknowns**: The exact rule for how input Maroon horizontals are selected/recombined (e.g., why some gaps are filled vertically vs. horizontally) cannot be explained from the data; it is consistent in outcome (sparser, connected lines) but the mapping mechanism is unknown.

3. **Green edge positions → Green edge preservation/adjustment (position affecting horizontal extension)**:
   - **Description**: Input Green components (single-pixel borders at x=0 and x=max-width, primarily at even y) consistently persist in outputs at the same edges, with minor adjustments to maintain boundary coverage alongside Maroon.
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - Position (x=0 or x=max, even y) → Position (x=0 or x=max in output Green bbox): Edge locations are preserved, but bbox may extend horizontally (e.g., from 1 pixel to 2 pixels wide) if adjacent Maroon does not cover the edge (e.g., input 1 Green at [0,2,0,2] → output [0,2,1,2] pixels=2 to bridge to Maroon starting at x=1).
     - Interaction with Maroon coverage → Green size (pixels and bbox width): Green extends (pixels=1 → 2) only where input/output Maroon leaves an edge gap; otherwise, it remains single-pixel or is absorbed (e.g., input 2 at y=10 has Maroon covering edges → output Green single-pixel at [0,10,0,10]).
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all edge Greens in both training examples; outputs never omit edge coverage, and extensions occur precisely where Maroon abuts but does not overlap the edge.
   - **Unknowns**: Mid-grid Greens in outputs (e.g., output 1 at y=12 x=3/9, not present in inputs) have no clear input connection and are inconsistent in placement; their origin or interaction is unknown and not reliably tied to other components.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., hole counts are uniformly 0 and non-interactive; total pixels or overall grid width vary without affecting transformations; no color shifts beyond Dark Red → Pink; no reliable position → color mappings outside the above). Elements like isolated Maroon gaps in inputs do not consistently affect outputs and are excluded.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 22:30:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where input grids with numbers (primarily 0s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s) represent frames and content areas; the goal is to transform the grid by replacing patterns in content rows (odd indices) and adjusting frame rows (even indices) to draw borders with 3s, place 6s based on adjacent content, fill with 8s, and handle zeros/segments specially, likely simulating some kind of enclosed drawing or puzzle visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Content rows (odd indices) must scan for consecutive 7-7-7 patterns and replace them specifically with 8-6-8, skipping ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlaps; this seems to "draw" vertical elements or supports in content.
 * Frame rows (even indices) collect 6 positions from adjacent content rows (above and below) and place 6s there, but only if the frame cell isn't already non-zero (avoids overwriting).
 * Borders on upper frames use 3s conditionally: left/right edges get 3s if the first/last 6 from above is within 4 positions of the edge or if the row has any zero; this seems intended to extend borders inward but is over-triggering in attempts.
 * Closing 3s: For non-bottom frames, place a 3 left of any zero if the zero is after the max 6 position; this handles "gaps" but is applying too broadly, creating unwanted borders.
 * Bottom frame is special: Treat zeros as segment dividers, and for each segment (between zeros), place a left 3 only if it contains a 6; always place a rightmost 3; if no zeros, it's a single segment with left 3 only if it has a 6.
 * Zeros represent empty/unfilled areas that shouldn't extend frames; frames should be full 8s where no content influence, but attempts add 3s too aggressively, especially on edges without justification.
 * Subtlety: Frames don't always border on every edge—e.g., top frames may not need left/right 3s if content 6s are centered, and bottom handles segments to avoid over-bordering empty parts.
 * Has_zero flag in upper borders seems to force edge 3s if any zero exists, but this is too loose and causes mismatches (e.g., adding 3s where expected is 8).
 * Max_six for closing only applies after max 6, but in attempts, it leads to 3s in wrong places like mid-row.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal bordering: 3s only where needed to close/enclose 6-influenced areas, not blanket edges; 8s fill everything else in frames.
 * Easy to miss: No overwriting of existing non-zeros in frames; bottom segment logic must skip empty segments (start > end).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., w=19 in ex1, w=16 in ex2), so code must be width-agnostic; assume all rows same length.
 * Process content first, then frames top-to-bottom, but upper frames look at above content only for borders (below for 6s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import inf

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for replacing 7 patterns in content rows to create vertical 6 supports.)

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> set:
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```
(Useful for extracting 6 positions from content to propagate to frames.)

```python
def place_sixes(row: List[int], six_pos: set) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in six_pos:
        if 0 <= j < w and row[j] != 0:
            row[j] = 6
```
(Helpful for safely placing 6s in frames without overwriting non-zeros, but note: the condition row[j] != 0 might be too strict if frames start as 0s everywhere.)

The main program structure (copy grid, process odd rows first, then even rows with 6 propagation and border logic) is a good skeleton, but border/closing functions are flawed.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def handle_upper_frame_borders(out: List[List[int]], i: int, six_pos_above_first: int, six_pos_above_last: int, has_zero: bool) -> None:
    # ... (as in code)
```
(This is broken: over-places 3s on edges if has_zero is true anywhere in row, leading to extra borders; the <=4 condition doesn't align with examples where centered content leaves edges as 8.)

```python
def handle_closing_threes(row: List[int], six_pos: set, max_six: int) -> None:
    w = len(row)
    for j in range(w):
        if row[j] == 0 and max_six <= j and j > 0:
            row[j - 1] = 3
```
(This is unhelpful/broken: applies closing 3s too early and without segment awareness, creating mid-frame borders where expected is continuous 8s; ignores right-side symmetry.)

```python
def handle_bottom_frame(out: List[int], i: int, six_pos: set) -> None:  # Note: param is List[int], should be List[List[int]]
    # ... (as in code)
```
(Broken: param type error (out is grid, but func takes List[int]); segment logic misses some cases like no left 3 for empty segments, and always adds right 3 even for empty full row; in ex1, it generates correct-ish bottom but with wrong left 3s in segments.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it partially succeeds: content row processing (7->8-6-8) appears correct in both trainings (e.g., 6s placed where expected in odd rows), and 6 propagation to frames works (matches 6 positions in evens).
 * What worked: Pattern replacement in content is accurate; collecting 6s from adjacent rows is right; bottom segment detection identifies zeros correctly in some cases (e.g., ex1 bottom has 8,8,0,3... matching expected start).
 * What didn't work: Frame borders over-place 3s, e.g., in train1 row0 (top frame), generated [3,8,...3] vs expected [8,8,...8]—no reason for edge 3s since content below starts 6s centered; similarly, row2 [3,3,8...] vs [3,3,8...] wait, actually row2 left 3s match but right ends with 3 vs 8.
 * Train1 mismatches: Row0 full edges 3s (wrong, should be 8s); row4 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row6 right [3,3] matches but left over-3? Wait, left [3,3] matches; row8 [3,8,...3] matches but internal 3 at pos15 wrong (expected no 3 there, it's 3,0,8,8,3 but generated has 3 before 0); row10 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row12 [8,8,0,3,...] matches expected [8,8,0,3,...].
 * Train2 mismatches: Row0 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row2 right [8,3] vs [8,8]; row4 [3,8,...3,3] vs [8,8,...3,3] (left 3 wrong); row6 [3,8,...3] vs [8,8,...8]; row8 [3,3,...3,3] matches; row10 [3,8,...3] vs expected [3,8,...3] wait, but expected ends 8,3? Wait, generated ends 8,3 matching, but left 3 might be extra.
 * General issue: has_zero forces too many edge 3s (e.g., any zero triggers full borders, but examples show edges stay 8 if content doesn't reach edges); closing_threes adds 3s after max_6 even in filled areas.
 * Bottom handling somewhat works but fails empty segments (e.g., adds left 3 where no 6).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs of 6s or enclosures) were attempted, but might be needed for better segment/border decisions—current code lacks holistic view of enclosed areas.
 * Attempts show understanding of alternating row types and 6 propagation, but miss subtlety that 3s are only for actual enclosure edges, not prophylactic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It has excessive 3s on frame edges and internals, e.g., row0 [3,8,...3] likely should be full 8s like train1 top (content below has 6s centered at pos10-11, not near edges); row2 [3,8,...3] probably wrong left 3 (content below sparse); row4 ends [3,3] but has internal 0 without proper closing; row6 [3,8,...3] vs likely [8,8,...8]; row10 [3,3,...3] has early left 3s and internal 3 before 0; row12 [3,8,...3] wrong edges; row14 [3,8,...3] wrong; row16 [3,8,...3] wrong; row18 [3,8,...0,3,...3] has 0 with 3 before but possibly wrong internal 3 at pos8.
 * Mentally simulating rules on test input (assuming similar to trains: input has 7s in odds replaced to 6s, frames start 0s): After content process, odds will have 6s at specific spots (e.g., row1 likely 6 at 10-11, row3 at 13-14, etc.); frames should propagate those 6s and add 3s only to enclose (e.g., left 3 only if 6 near left, no blanket edges); bottom row18 should segment on 0 at ~pos7 and pos? , adding 3s per has_6 but generated has extra 3 at pos8 and ends 3 correctly but left likely wrong. Overall, output looks over-bordered, missing continuous 8 fills where no enclosure needed—doesn't match inferred correct (more 8-heavy frames like train expects).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing line segments, colors, or structural elements in a diagram like a floor plan or abstract pattern) that undergoes transformation rules to generate a new grid. The rules focus on detecting and modifying patterns in odd rows (e.g., sequences of 7s) and applying conditional overlays (e.g., 3s for edges or boundaries) to even rows based on adjacent "centers," zeros, and positional logic between upper/lower elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows are processed by identifying non-overlapping sequences of three consecutive 7s, replacing them with [8, 6, 8] to mark a "center" at the middle position; this skips over the triple to avoid overlap, but misses if 7s are isolated or in pairs.
 * Even rows start with a base layer: positions with 0 stay 0, centers from adjacent odd rows get 6, and all other non-zero positions get 8; this creates a foundational "fill" that gets overlaid.
 * Overlays for even rows vary by position: top rows have no overlays (pure base), bottom rows add 3s to the start of non-zero segments (if base is 8) and always to the end if 8; internal even rows use complex left/right placement logic based on the relative positions of min/max centers from upper and lower odd rows (e.g., place left 3 if no lower centers or if upper min < lower min), plus pre-pending 3 before zeros if adjacent base is 8, and boundary adjustments only if no zeros.
 * Subtle edge cases: Zeros in input rows block or trigger specific 3 placements (e.g., sides always get 3 if zeros present); segments in bottom overlays are contiguous non-zeros, and 3s only apply if the base is 8; centers are sets to handle multiples without overlap.
 * Global considerations: Grid dimensions (m rows, n cols) must be handled dynamically; assume even rows are 0,2,... and odd 1,3,...; no modifications to input zeros except in base; potential for multiple centers per row affecting adjacents; rules seem to simulate "structural supports" or "boundaries" around detected objects (7-triples as holes or features).
 * Easy-to-miss: The left/right placement in internal evens depends on comparative positions of entire center sets (min/max), not individual; if no upper/lower, defaults to full placement; bottom end always gets 3 if 8, regardless of segments; the i+=3 skip in odd processing ensures non-overlapping but may leave trailing 7s untouched if not in triples.
 * All attempts considered: No object extraction needed (rules are row-wise, not holistic); focus on adjacency between odd/even pairs; potential for visual alignment (e.g., 6 as vertical supports, 3/8 as horizontals, 0 as voids); test grids may have irregular zero placements or multiple centers requiring precise min/max logic.

(The overlay functions like apply_internal_even_overlays, apply_bottom_overlays are helpful for specific row types but overly complex; simplify left/right logic if min/max comparisons fail edge cases. No types beyond List[List[int]] needed. No extraction functions for full objects, as rules are local to rows/adjacencies.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles odd row processing (triple 7 detection and replacement) and base even row computation, as evidenced by both training examples passing.
 * Internal even row overlays work for simple cases (e.g., no zeros, single centers) but may mishandle complex min/max comparisons for left/right placement when multiple upper/lower centers overlap or are symmetric, potentially placing 3s incorrectly on boundaries.
 * Bottom row overlays correctly add 3s to segment starts and ends but might over-apply if segments are short (<3) or if zeros interrupt in ways that create unintended 8-to-3 changes before zeros (the pre-pend logic is in internal, not bottom, which could be a miss).
 * Top rows are correctly left as base (no overlays), which is simple and likely right.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core row-wise processing; however, the adj_centers union from upper/lower is essential but assumes centers are only in odd rows (correct per code).
 * The has_zero flag and pre-pending 3 before zeros (in internal) is a good subtlety but only applies if base left is 8, which might miss if zero is at edge.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and correct for non-overlapping triples; process_odd_row is solid but doesn't handle overlapping possibles (though puzzle likely doesn't have them).
 * apply_internal_even_overlays is helpful but convoluted—its place_left/place_right logic based on min/max could be broken for test cases with equal min/max (defaults to False, potentially no side 3s when needed).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though overlay apps could be merged for clarity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating even/odd patterns), with visible patterns like repeated [8,8,...,6,8,...] in evens and [0,... ,6,8,...] in odds, plus 3s at edges/segments, which looks visually consistent with a structural overlay puzzle (e.g., 6s as supports under 7-triple centers, 3s as boundaries around voids/0s).
 * It makes sense overall: odd rows show processed 6s where triples were, evens have bases with 6s at adj centers and 3s on sides/bottoms; for example, row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10, matching a likely 7-triple, and adjacent evens (rows 0/2) have 6 there with 8s elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots—e.g., row 4 (even, internal?) has 3s at cols 0,6,16 but a 0 at col7, suggesting pre-pend logic applied, but if this is bottom-like, the segment 3s might be over-applied (row 4: [3,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] ends with 3 at col16, but trailing 8s after 0 might need different handling); row 8 (even) has 3s at end [...,3,3] which seems like bottom rule but positionally odd if not bottom row.
 * Differences from expected: Without exact expected output, hard to confirm, but potential issues include extra 3s in internal rows (e.g., row 14: [8,... ,3,3] at end, possibly misplaced if not bottom) or missed 3s before zeros (e.g., row 17: [3,8,8,6,... ,0,3] has 0 at col6? Wait, listed as [3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,...]—the 0 at col7 followed by 3 at col8 suggests segment start 3, but if base was 8 before 0, why no pre-pend? This indicates the internal pre-pend logic might be broken or not triggered, differing from expected boundary reinforcement).
 * Another mismatch: Row 2 (even) has [3,3,8,... ,6,8,8,6,8,8,8] with leading 3s and internal 6s, but if adj centers are at cols 10 and 13?, the double 3 at start might be over-placement if has_zero=True (many 0s in input?); looks like it places left even with zeros, but expected might skip if lower centers dominate.
 * Overall, test output is plausible (80% match vibe) but likely incorrect in 2-3 rows due to left/right logic or zero-handling subtleties—e.g., row 16 (odd? Wait, output row16: [8,8,8,6,...] seems even-like, but indexing off); needs adjustment for comparative center positions in multi-center tests.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving row-by-row processing of a binary-like grid (using numbers 0 for empty, 8 for filled, 6 for special markers like holes or anchors, 3 for boundary/edge markers, and 7 as a temporary pattern in odd rows). The goal is to transform the input grid by first modifying odd rows to detect and replace patterns of three 7s with an 8-6-8 sequence (indicating a detected "object" or segment with a hole), then updating even rows to fill with 8s everywhere non-zero in the original, place 6s at positions aligned with 6s in adjacent odd rows, and insert 3s at segment edges, gaps, or boundaries to denote closures or starts, while handling top/bottom edges differently.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, i.e., rows 1,3,5...) are pre-processed only for sequences of exactly three consecutive 7s, replacing them with 8-6-8 to mark a "hole" or internal feature; longer or shorter 7 sequences are ignored, and this scan advances by 3 only on match, otherwise by 1.
 * Even rows (0-based indexing, i.e., rows 0,2,4...) start as 8s where original was non-zero (ignoring zeros as gaps), with 6s overlaid from the union of 6 positions in the immediately above and below odd rows (if they exist); top row (i=0) has no above, bottom row (i=m-1 if even) has no below.
 * 3s are placed as "edge closures": for non-top even rows, opening 3s replace leading 8s after a 0-gap if the following segment has a 6; closing 3s replace trailing 8s before a 0-gap if the segment has a 6 (but only for non-bottom rows).
 * Edge 3s (left/rightmost positions): For bottom even rows, left 3 at position 0 if there's a left segment with 6s before the first 0, extending to position 1 if the min 6 is <=4 positions away; similarly right 3 at w-1, extending to w-2 if max 6 is <=4 from end. For internal even rows (not top/bottom), left/right 3s only if both above and below have 6-segments and the upper segment protrudes (min/max mismatch with lower).
 * Subtleties: 3s only apply to segments containing at least one 6 (no 3s for 8-only segments); zeros in original even rows create gaps that split segments but don't propagate 6s across; top row gets no edge 3s; bottom row skips internal closing 3s but gets special edge handling; overlapping 6s from above/below union without conflict; process odd rows first on a copy, then even rows using original for non-zero check but modified odds for 6 positions.
 * Gaps between segments: Internal gaps (zeros) trigger opening/closing 3s only if the adjacent segment has 6s, and scans must handle multiple segments per row without overlapping modifications.
 * Easy to miss: The 7-pattern replacement is greedy but non-overlapping (j+=3 on match); edge extensions for 3s are distance-limited (<=4 positions); no 3s on top row; bottom row's edge 3s use original zeros for "first/last zero" boundaries; internal edge 3s require both adjacent odds to have 6s and protrusion.
 * All considerations: Preserve zeros in even rows initially but override with 8/6/3; no changes to odd rows after initial 7-processing; width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```

def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> Set[int]:
    """Extracts set of indices where value is 6, useful for unioning above/below influences on even rows."""
    return {j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 6}
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles the 7-to-8-6-8 replacement in odd rows and basic 6 placement in even rows via union of adjacent 6s.
 * Correctly processes training example 1 and 2 fully, indicating core rules for segment filling with 8s, 6 overlays, and basic edge/gap 3s are captured.
 * Handles top row by skipping above 6s and no edge 3s; bottom row skips closing 3s but applies special left/right edge 3s based on first/last zero and proximity (<=4).
 * Internal edge 3s correctly condition on both above/below having 6s and protrusion (min/max mismatch).
 * Gap handling separates opening 3s (after 0 to 8 with 6 in segment) and closing 3s (8 to 0 with 6 in segment), but closing only for non-bottom; scans are careful to skip zeros and process segment-by-segment.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; process_content_row and get_six_positions are essential and correct for detecting 7-patterns and extracting 6 anchors.
 * Potential misses: Edge extensions might over-apply if w is small; internal gap scans could loop inefficiently but work; no handling for overlapping segments or non-uniform w (assumes uniform).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output processes 19 rows (odd count, so last is even? Wait, listed as 19 lines but may be 18+1; assumes m=18 or similar), with odd rows showing 7-replacements (e.g., row 1 has 6 at pos 10, row 3 at 13, row 5 at 13? Wait, output shows modified odds implicitly via evens).
 * Even rows mostly fill with 8s where original non-zero, 6s at union positions (e.g., row 0 has 6 at 10, matching below; row 2 has 6s at 10 and 13; row 4 has 6 at 13, 3 at 8?).
 * 3s appear at edges/gaps: e.g., row 2 starts with 3 (opening after implied gap? But row 2: [3,8,...6 at 10,8,6 at 13,...]); row 4 has 3 at 8 (internal?); row 8 ends with 3; row 10 has 3 at 9; row 14 ends with 3; row 16 has no leading 3 but 6s; row 18 has leading 3s at 0-1, ends with 3s at 15-16.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8], the 3 at position 8 seems like a closing 3 before a 0 at 7? But position 7 is 0, and segment before has no 6 (all 8s from 0-6), so no 3 should be there per rules (3s only for segments with 6); this indicates bug in closing 3 logic applying without 6 check in some gaps. Similarly, row 18 [3,3,8,6,...3,3] has double 3s at start/end, which matches edge extension (<=4 from min/max 6), but if no protrusion or wrong first_zero, it over-applies. Row 10 [8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,...] has 3 at 9 before 0 at 10, but segment 4-9 has 6 at 4, so closing 3 ok, but why 0 at 10 preserved while later 8s? Expected: more consistent gap handling without stray 0s in output even rows unless original. Overall, core 6/8 placement seems correct, but 3 placements have errors in non-6 segments and possibly bottom edge miscalculation; test mismatches expected by applying 3s to 8-only segments and incorrect internal closings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like elements such as empty space (0), lines (8), holes or dips (6), corners or starts/ends (3), and temporary patterns (7)) where even and odd rows are processed differently to simulate structural transformations, such as replacing sequences in content rows and propagating influences like holes (6) to adjacent structure rows to form boundaries or edges (3).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (0-based index 1,3,5,...) are "content" rows processed for patterns like three consecutive 7s, which are replaced by 8-6-8 to introduce a "hole" or dip in a line.
 * Even rows (0-based index 0,2,4,...) are "structure" rows: non-zero cells are initially set to 8 (solid line), but positions aligned with 6s in adjacent odd rows are overridden to 6 (creating vertical alignment for holes), and edges of segments containing 6s are marked as 3 (possibly corners or boundary starts/ends).
 * Boundary handling is crucial: top row (i=0) skips some propagations; bottom row (i=m-1 if even) treats right edge specially if it ends with 8; middle even rows check left/right adjacency to 0s for placing 3s at segment starts/ends if the segment has a 6.
 * Additional edge logic for non-bottom even rows uses min/max positions of 6s in adjacent odd rows to decide left/right 3 placements, with distance-based rules (e.g., if min_a <=4, set position 1 to 3), suggesting asymmetry or specific visual flaring/crowning at edges influenced by hole positions.
 * Subtlety: Segments in even rows are contiguous non-zero runs; 3s are only placed at the very start/end of such runs if they border 0 and the run contains a 6, but only if the end cell is 8 (not already 6).
 * Zero cells act as separators; empty rows (all 0s) may indicate dividers or unused space.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes fixed alternation of even/odd row types starting with even as structure, but grids may have varying heights; also, 7s only appear in odd rows initially.
 * All_six union from above/below ensures bidirectional influence of holes on structure rows.
 * The j-increment in process_content_row skips after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-777 advances by 1.
 * For bottom even row, right-edge 3 only if e==w and last is 8, differing from middle rows' check for out[i][e-1].

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    # In-place replaces 777 with 868 in odd/content rows, skipping after replacement.
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:

    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```

def find_segments(row: List[int]) -> List[tuple[int, int, bool]]:
    # Helpful for future: identifies contiguous non-zero segments with start/end indices and whether they contain a 6.
    # Not in previous code, but useful for clearer 3-placement logic.
    segments = []
    w = len(row)
    j = 0

        if row[j] == 0:
            j += 1

            j += 1
        e = j
        segments.append((s, e, has6))
    return segments
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of core row alternation, 777 replacement, 6-propagation to override 8s, and basic segment-based 3-placement at edges bordering 0s when containing 6s.
 * Worked: process_content_row accurately handles pattern replacement without overlap; get_six_positions enables vertical alignment of holes; initial 8-setting in even rows solidifies structure.
 * Didn't work fully: The additional min/max logic for left/right 3s in non-bottom even rows (e.g., using min_a < min_b to set out[i][0]=3 or out[i][1]=3 if min_a<=4) seems ad-hoc and may over-apply 3s based on hole distances, potentially incorrect for asymmetric hole influences; bottom row's special e==w check for right 3 is handled but may miss if last cell is already 6.
 * The code mutates out in-place but copies input initially, which is good; however, it skips some logic for i==0 and i==m-1 appropriately but has redundant code for bottom/middle 3-placement (could be unified with find_segments-like logic).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (process_content_row, get_six_positions) are relevant and correct for their purposes, though the main program could benefit from extracting segment finding to reduce duplication.
 * Training successes suggest core pattern replacement and propagation work, but test reveals potential issues in edge flaring (3 placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, mostly 17 columns) shows processed structure (even) and content (odd) rows with 8s dominant, 6s aligned vertically in places (e.g., column 10 in rows 1/2, column 13-14 in rows 3/4), and 3s at various edges/starts (e.g., left 3 in row 2 col0, right 3s in row 4 cols15-16, isolated 3 in row 8 col16).
 * Does not look fully correct: Several 3 placements seem erroneous or over-applied, e.g., row 4 (even, index 4) has 3 at col0, col8 (odd position, possibly from segment start), and clustered 3s at cols15-16 which may violate "only at bordering 0 if 8" rule—row 4 ends with 3,3 but input likely has non-zero run; compare to expected where 3s should only mark true corners without clustering. Row 10 (even, index 10) starts with 3,3 at cols0-1, suggesting the min_a<=4 logic wrongly set col1 to 3 despite no bordering 0 or segment start. Row 16 has 3 at col16 but the row seems full 8/6 without clear end-border 0, indicating bottom-row special case misfired. Overall, vertical 6 alignments look correct (e.g., col4 in rows 8/9), but 3s appear too frequent on left/right, possibly from flawed min/max distance rules creating unintended "flares"; this mismatches expected cleaner boundaries around hole-influenced segments. Anomalies like empty row 5 (all 0s) preserved correctly, but row 18 (odd? wait, output has 19 rows, possibly including extra) ends abruptly with 3s that don't align with above 6s in col3/12.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids with numbers like 0 (gaps/empty), 3 (potential markers), and 7 (likely line segments or connectors) are processed to output a new grid marking structures: 8's for filled frames/walls, 6's for "pink" connection points (e.g., on triple 7 patterns), and 3's for corner or endpoint markers, with distinct rules for even (frame) rows and odd (data) rows to simulate visual assembly like circuits, frames, or linked objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (data rows, indexed 1,3,...) are scanned for consecutive triples of 7's to place a central 6 (pink) with flanking 8's, and vertically propagate 6's to adjacent even rows at the same column, skipping ahead by 3 columns after matches to avoid overlap.
 * Even rows (frame rows, indexed 0,2,...) are filled with 8's where input is non-zero (except 0's stay 0), but 3's are overlaid based on gap presence: no gaps lead to edge or adjacent-to-pink 3's (e.g., left/right of first/last pink, or full edges for bottom row); gaps trigger 3's at transitions from 8 to 0 or where input has 3 and output would be 8.
 * Subtle vertical interactions: 6's in odd rows influence 3 placements in even rows above/below via checks on adjacent 8's and pinks in neighboring rows (e.g., for internal no-gap rows, check i-1 row for 8 next to 6).
 * Bottom row (last even i) has special no-gap handling (just edge 3's if 8) vs. gap handling (3's right before gaps from left, plus right edge).
 * Gaps are detected per even row via any 0 in input; internal gap rows also check input 3's directly for overriding 8's to 3's at edges.
 * Easy to miss: j-indexing must handle width boundaries (e.g., p-1 >=0, q+1 <width); propagation only if ii-1/ii+1 in bounds; no 3 placements on top row (i==0); incremental j+=1 or j+=3 in odd row loop to cover all without overlap.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes modular structure detection (e.g., triple 7's as units) and conditional filling/marking to avoid over-writing (e.g., 3's only if underlying is 8, not on existing 6 or 0).
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure out grid initializes to 0's; handle empty grid edge case; no modifications to odd rows beyond initial pink/8 placements (no 3's there); vertical 6 propagation only at pink columns, not flanks.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new types or functions introduced in this attempt; the core logic is inline in the main function. Previous attempts might have benefited from a helper to detect triples:

```python
def find_triple_sevens(row: List[int], width: int) -> List[int]:
    """Returns starting indices of consecutive 7-7-7 triples in row."""
    starts = []
    j = 0
    while j < width - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j+1] == 7 and row[j+2] == 7:
            starts.append(j)
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
    return starts
```

This could replace the inline while loop in odd rows for clarity, but the current inline version works fine and is not broken.

No unhelpful functions noted; the logic avoids extraneous tools like full object extraction, as the puzzle is row-wise procedural rather than holistic blob detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled training example 1 and 2, correctly placing 6's on triple 7's, filling 8's in even rows based on non-zero input, and overlaying 3's for edges/gaps/pink adjacencies without over-writing.
 * Worked well: Odd row triple detection and vertical 6 propagation; even row gap detection via any(0); basic filling of 8's where input !=0.
 * Did not work or potential issues: In complex test cases with multiple pinks/gaps per row, the 3 placement logic for internal no-gap rows relies on min/max pink positions and checks like out[i-1][p+1]==6, which might miss if pinks are not aligned or if adjacent row checks fail boundary conditions (e.g., p=0 or q=width-1); bottom gap handling scans left-to-right for 0 followed by 8 but may not catch rightmost transitions symmetrically.
 * Earlier attempts (inferred from code evolution) likely missed vertical propagation or gap-based 3's, but this version incorporates them, passing training.
 * No extraction functions used or needed, as puzzle is rule-based per row pair, not object-oriented; avoid blob-extraction helpers as they overcomplicate simple pattern matching.
 * Subtle miss in prior logic (possibly): For internal no-gap, 3's are placed at row[0]/row[1] or row[width-1]/row[width-2] only if conditions on first/last pink hold, which might skip if no pinks or misaligned—training passed, but test may expose.
 * Overall, core row alternation and pattern skipping (j+=3) are solid; unhelpful would be global searches ignoring row types.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (19 rows, width=17) shows consistent 8/6/3/0 placements: e.g., row 1 (odd) has 6 at col 10 with 8's at 9/11, matching triple 7 pattern; vertical 6's propagate to row 0/2 at col 10/13; row 2 (even) has 3's at 0/1 and 15/16? Wait, output shows [3,3,8,...6,8,8,6,8,8,8]—3's at start, but logic for i=2 (internal) with possible gaps needs check.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 [3,8,8,...3,0,8,...6,8,8,3], the 0 at col 7 with 8 at col 8 suggests a gap transition, but 3 is not placed at col 7 (stays 0) or immediately before—logic for internal gap should place 3 at j-1 if row_in[j]==0 and out[j-1]==8, but here if input has 0 at 7 and 8 at 8, it should set out[7-1? wait j=7]==3? Scanning shows no 3 at col 6/7, instead 3 at col 6? Wait, row 4 starts 3,8,8,...3,0,8— the 3 before 0 might be misplaced if input 3 there, but vertical from row 3's 6 at col 13 affects row 4 col 13=6, ok; however, end has 3 at col 16, correct for edge.
 * Missing or incorrect: Row 10 [3,8,8,...3,0,8,...8,3] has 0 at col 10 with 8 at 11, but no 3 at col 10 (0) or col 9? Logic should place 3 at j=10 if row_in[10]==0 and out[10]==0 and out[9]==8, but output has 3 at col 9? Wait, [3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3]—yes, 3 at col 9 before 0 at 10, then 8 at 11, so it caught the transition at j=10 (set out[9]=3); seems correct there.
 * Looks partially correct but suspicious in row 16 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8]—multiple 6's, no 3's, assuming no gaps and internal, but if adjacent to pinks in row 15/17, might need 3's near them (e.g., near col 3/7/12 6's, check for left/right 8's next to upper 6's); output has no 3's, which might miss if conditions like out[15][j-1]==6 trigger edge 3's.
 * Row 18 [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3] has 0 at col 7, 3 at col 8 (after 0?), and 3 at end— for bottom row (i=18? assuming height=19 even), gap handling should place 3 at j+1 if row_in[j]==0 and out[j]==0 and out[j+1]==8, so for j=7 (0) and out[8]==8, set out[8]=3, yes matches; but why 0 at 7 stays 0, correct. Overall, most placements align with logic, but potential under-placement of 3's in no-gap internals (e.g., row 6 [8,8,...8] all 8's, no 3's despite possible pinks above/below at col 7).
 * The test output makes sense for simple cases but may not handle all subtle vertical pink-to-3 interactions, leading to missing edge 3's in multi-structure grids; differences from expected: fewer 3's near clustered pinks (e.g., row 8 ends with 3,3 but logic might place only if conditions met—unknown if input triggers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid transformation where odd rows process groups of three 7s into 8-6-8 patterns (with surrounding zeros), even rows place 6s at vertical centers from adjacent odd rows and fill non-zero areas with 8s or 3s based on adjacency to zeros and border conditions, aiming to create a coherent visual structure like a stylized image or diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, every other starting from row 1): Initialize to zeros, then replace every non-overlapping group of three consecutive 7s with 8-6-8; isolated or partial 7s remain zero; centers of these groups (the middle 6 position) are collected for vertical alignment.
 * Even rows (0-based indexing, every other starting from row 0): Place 6s at column positions matching collected centers from the nearest odd rows above/below; default non-zero input cells (from original grid) to 8 unless overridden; special top row (r=0) sets all non-zero non-6 to 8 without further adjacency checks.
 * Adjacency to zeros in even rows: For segments between zeros, if a segment adjacent to a zero contains a 6, set the edge cell(s) of that segment (closest to the zero) to 3 instead of 8; this applies differently for bottom row (only forward/after) vs. internal rows (both directions); zeros themselves stay zero.
 * Border extensions in even rows: For left/right edges, if no zeros in prefix/suffix and certain center position conditions hold (e.g., min/max centers from adjacent rows satisfy inequalities like upper <= lower for left), extend 3s into the border (position 0 or cols-1, and possibly one more if distance <=4); if condition holds but zero present, retain original input value.
 * Subtleties: Overlapping or skipped 7 groups in odd rows advance i by 1 if not exact three 7s, potentially leaving gaps as zero; 6 placements in even rows use set union from adjacent centers, ignoring duplicates; INF=100 as sentinel for missing centers; right border condition always true for bottom row or if lower max center <= upper max; code assumes rectangular grid with cols fixed; potential off-by-one in segment bounds (e.g., seg_end_b = c-1 could be negative); no handling for cols <3 in odd row groups.
 * Key considerations across attempts: Preserve original zeros in even rows unless overridden; non-6 non-zero defaults to 8 but can become 3 via adjacency or border rules; centers only from exact 7-7-7 groups, not partial; vertical alignment prioritizes nearest odd rows; border logic uses min/max centers for "stretching" decisions, with left/right asymmetry (e.g., left uses min centers comparison, right uses max); potential for multiple 6s per row leading to sorted list for first/last; no diagonal or multi-row interactions beyond centers.

            else:
                i += 1
    return centers
# This is helpful for isolating the 7-group detection and center collection
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid understanding of odd-row 7-to-8-6-8 replacement, center-based 6 placement in even rows, default 8 filling, and basic zero-adjacency 3 overrides.
 * Worked well: Precise non-overlapping group detection in odd rows (advancing i+=3 only on matches), set-based 6 positions for efficiency, top-row simplification (no adjacency checks), and border extensions using min/max centers with conditions like k_upper_l <= k_lower_l.
 * Did not work or incomplete: Adjacent zero rules in even rows have potential bugs in segment calculation (e.g., has_six_b checks max(0, seg_start_b) but seg_end_b could be -1 unhandled; next segment min(cols-1, seg_end_a) may clip incorrectly); bottom row only applies forward 3s, but code uses r == rows-1 check which assumes 0-based indexing correctly; border left/right extensions set to 3 even if original was non-zero, potentially overriding without preservation; no handling for empty centers (uses INF or -1 sentinels, but comparisons like -1 <= something may fail subtly); right border condition "(r + 1 >= rows) or (k_lower_r <= k_upper_r)" is always true for bottom but uses max centers which could misalign if no lower centers.
 * extract_centers_odd_rows (derived from code) is essential and correct for vertical 6 placement; main program loop for even rows adjacency is helpful but buggy in edge cases (e.g., z_idx loop assumes sorted zero_pos, which it is via list comp).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all embedded logic is relevant, though the complex while loop for zero segments could be refactored for clarity (not broken, just dense).
 * General: Code assumes all rows have same cols (no validation); INF=100 works but arbitrary (could use float('inf')); no output validation (e.g., ensure no leftover 7s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (18x17 grid) mostly makes sense and follows the code's logic: Odd rows show 8-6-8 patterns where expected (e.g., row 1 [index 1]: zeros except 8-6-8 at cols 9-11; row 3: 8-6-8 at 12-14), even rows have 6s at aligned centers (e.g., row 0 col 10=6 from row1 center; row 2 col10=6 and col13=6 from row1/3), defaults to 8s in non-zero areas, and 3s near zeros or borders (e.g., row 2 starts with 3s, ends with 6-8; row 4 has 3s at edges and near zero at col7).
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4 (even, internal), there's a 0 at col7 but adjacent segments set to 3 only at col8? (code sets output[r][8]=3, but expected might propagate more or handle isolated zero differently; unclear without input, but output has 8-0-3 which may violate "edge to zero" if segment before/after has 6); row 10 (even) has 3-3 at start but then 8s jumping to 0 at col10 (keeps zero, but border left extension sets col0-1=3, seems correct but if input had non-zero there, override might be wrong); row 16 (even, near bottom) has 3-3 at start and end, with 6s at cols3,7,12 but code's right extension sets col16=3 only if cond and no suffix zero—output has 3 at end, plausible but if suffix had zero, should retain input (unknown without input); overall, scattered 0s in even rows are preserved, but some 3 placements look asymmetric (e.g., row 8 ends with 3 but no clear suffix zero); row 18? (last line seems cut off or extra, but assuming 18 rows total); the output visually resembles a pattern (perhaps a figure or map) but has inconsistencies like isolated 6s without vertical alignment in some spots (e.g., row 6 col7=6 but check adjacent odd centers); without test input grid, hard to verify exactly, but differences suggest bugs in segment has_six checks or border conds leading to missed 3s or extra 8s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a rule-based grid transformation puzzle, likely simulating a visual logic or matching game (e.g., similar to a match-3 or pattern-filling puzzle) where an input grid of numbers (0 for empty/zeros, 7 for "pink" elements, 8 for background/fillers, etc.) is processed row-by-row to generate an output grid. Odd rows handle replacements of triple-7 patterns with [8,6,8] (introducing "pink" 6s), while even rows start with 8s, preserve 0s, propagate 6s vertically from adjacent odd rows, and strategically place 3s at segment boundaries, edges, or near 0s based on conditions like zero counts, previous row patterns, and segment analysis to enforce puzzle rules like boundary marking or scoring.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (1-based indexing, i.e., rows 1,3,5...): Scan for consecutive [7,7,7] triples and replace them directly with [8,6,8]; non-matching positions copy the input value. This introduces vertical "pink" columns (6s) that propagate to even rows above/below, but only if the even row is within a 3-row window starting from the even row preceding the odd row (e.g., for odd row r=1, affects even rows 0,1,2 but clipped to grid height).
 * Even rows (0,2,4...): Initialize to all 8s, then overlay input 0s (preserving empties). Propagate 6s to positions derived from centers of [7,7,7] in the nearest odd row above (or below if applicable), ensuring no duplicates per row.
 * Placement of 3s in even rows: Highly conditional and subtle—skipped entirely for row 0 (first even row). For other even rows:
   * If no 0s (num_zeros == 0) and row >=2: Use previous odd row's [7,7,7] centers to determine left/right edge placements (e.g., place 3s at columns 0-1 if leftmost center <=4; at width-2 to width-1 if rightmost >= width-5). Special override for the "last end" even row (derived from the lowest odd row with 7s): If previous centers are centrally placed (min >4 and max < width-5), force 3s only at absolute edges (0 and width-1).
   * If 0s present (or fallback): Identify non-zero segments (runs of 8s/6s), but only process those containing at least one 6. For each such segment: Place 3 at start if it's at edge (col 0) or adjacent to a 0 on left; place 3 at end if adjacent to 0 on right and the gap from the segment's last 6 to end >=3.
   * Global right-end handling: If the rightmost segment ends at width-1 and contains a 6, force 3 at width-1. Additionally, for trailing non-zero segments without 6s but after a 0, check if any 6 exists left of the preceding 0—if yes, force 3 at width-1.
 * Last red (lowest odd row with any 7): Used to compute a "last even end" row (last_red//2 *2 +2), which triggers special central-to-edge 3 placement if no 0s and previous centers are middle-only.
 * Edge cases: Grid height/width vary (test is 19 rows x 17 cols); handle j < width-2 for triple scans to avoid index errors; no 3s in row 0; propagation clips to grid bounds; assumes input has no other numbers besides 0,7,8 (others copy as-is in odd rows).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Vertical 6 propagation is not direct above/below but offset by row//2 *2 start, spanning 3 rows; 3 placements depend on segment *having* a 6 (skips pure-8 segments); gap >=3 for end-3 only if post-last-6; trailing no-6 segment after 0 gets end-3 only if prior 6s exist anywhere left; special "no zeros middle" for last end avoids over-placing 3s centrally.
 * All considerations: Preserve 0s exactly; 6s only from valid [7,7,7] centers (j+1 position); segments defined as consecutive non-0s post-6/0 placement; left-3 always if segment starts after 0 or at 0; right-3 conditional on adjacency and gap; no overwriting of 0s or 6s with 3s; handle empty grid or no 7s (last_red=-1, no special end).

No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt—the core logic for scanning triples, propagating 6s, and conditional 3s is functional and relevant, though the no-zeros case has nested special rules that could be refactored for clarity. The segment finder is essential for zero-present cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of odd-row [7,7,7] to [8,6,8] replacement, 6 propagation, 0 preservation, and basic 3 boundary placement.
 * What worked: Odd row processing is robust (direct replacement without errors); even row 6 placement correctly derives from pink centers and avoids overlaps; segment-based 3s work for cases with 0s (e.g., left-3 after 0, right-3 with gap>=3); no-zeros edge 3s based on prev centers align with left/right extensions; special last-end override prevents over-central 3s.
 * What didn't work/missed: In no-zeros case, the double-if for left/right (l_min <=4 for cols 0-1; r_max >=width-5 for width-2/-1) may over-place if multiple centers span edges (e.g., if centers at both ends, might duplicate 3s unintentionally, though code doesn't overwrite); trailing no-6 segment after 0 checks "any prior 6 left of the 0" but scans entire left (inefficient, but correct); potential miss in test for row 10 (0-based even row 10): places 3 at col 0 (edge), col 9 (possibly segment end before 0 at 10?), and col 16 (right end), but if expected no 3 at 9 (if segment lacks sufficient gap or no prior 6), it over-places—unknown if mismatch without expected output; row 18 has 3 at col 6 (possibly erroneous if not a valid left-3 or gap), 3 at 8 (after 0 at 7, but as left of next segment?), suggesting possible bug in consecutive 0/segment handling or rightmost logic applying too broadly; row 4 has 3 at col 8 (immediately after 0 at 7, as left-3) and col 16 (right end), which seems correct, but 3 at 16 might be forced despite no trailing check needed.
 * extract_objects equivalent (pink centers finder) is essential for 6 propagation and no-zeros 3s; the last_red finder is key for special end-row handling.
 * No irrelevant functions; all code ties to puzzle (no broken parts, but monolithic structure misses modularity for debugging subtleties like gap calculations).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output mostly makes sense and aligns with inferred rules: Odd rows correctly show [8,6,8] patterns (e.g., row 2 has 6 at col 10; row 12 has 6 at 10; row 16 has 6s at 3,7,12), 0s preserved in even rows (e.g., row 1 all 0s except 8,6,8 at 9-11; row 14 has 0s with 8,6,8 at 6-8), 6s propagated vertically (e.g., col 10 has 6s in rows 1,3,13,15 aligning with odd-row pinks), and 3s at boundaries (e.g., row 4: 3 after 0 at col8 start, 3 at end col16; row 10: 3 at start col0, 3 before 0 at col9?, 3 at end; row 18: 3s at edges, around central 0 at col7).
 * However, it does not look fully correct in subtle spots: Row 10 has 3 at col9 (position before 0 at10), but if this is a short segment without gap>=3 from last6 or no prior6 left of the 0, it might be invalid over-placement (expected perhaps no 3 there, leaving 8); row 18 has 3 at col6 (possibly a right-3 from prior segment ending before 0? but followed by 0 at7 then 3 at8 as left-3, suggesting correct adjacency but potential double-3 if segments merge incorrectly); row 4's 3 at col8 is correct as left after 0, but trailing 3 at16 seems forced by rightmost-has6, which is good, but if test expects no end-3 without 0 adjacency, it's a mismatch. Overall, core patterns (6s, 0s, edge 3s) look correct, but segment-end 3s in mid-0 areas (e.g., col9 in row10, col6/8 in row18) may violate gap or has6 conditions—unknown exact expectation, but differs from a "cleaner" boundary-only placement without internal 3s near isolated 0s. Account for test's taller grid (19 rows) by ensuring last_red/end propagation doesn't clip or misapply specials to non-final rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a rule-based cellular automaton-style puzzle on a grid of integers (likely representing visual elements like lines, supports, or shapes in a 2D diagram), where odd rows (content rows) are transformed by pattern replacement, and even rows (structural rows) are updated based on "support" positions marked by 6s from adjacent rows, incorporating protrusions, closures, and edge effects with values like 8 (solid), 6 (support), 3 (cap/protrusion), and 0 (empty/gap).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content) replace sequences of three 7s with 8-6-8, effectively inserting a "support" (6) in the middle of a solid run, but only in non-overlapping triplets; this must be done iteratively without backtracking, so overlapping patterns like 7777 would only catch the first three.
 * Even rows start as all 8s (solids) where input is non-zero, then overlay 6s at positions supported by 6s in adjacent odd rows (above or below); top even row only looks below, bottom only above, internal look both ways and union the sets.
 * Protrusions (3s) on even rows occur at edges if the above 6-range extends beyond the below 6-range (left/right asymmetry), limited to positions 0,1 (left) or w-2,w-1 (right), and only if within 4 units of the extreme 6; this simulates "overhangs" but is capped and conditional on existing 8s.
 * Closing 3s on non-bottom even rows: Scan for contiguous non-zero segments; if a segment contains a 6 and ends with an 8 adjacent to a 0, cap the end with 3 (but only the right end of the segment).
 * Bottom even rows apply symmetric "bottom threes": For each non-zero segment with a 6, cap the start (left) with 3 if it's 8, and the end (right) with 3 if it's 8 and at grid edge.
 * Subtleties: 0s act as gaps/dividers, so processing skips or respects them in segment scans; min/max 6 positions determine asymmetry for protrusions, using inf/-inf for empty sets; no processing if grid empty or single row; copies input to output before mutating.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion logic is asymmetric and distance-limited (≤4 from extreme), potentially missing long overhangs; closing threes only apply to right ends adjacent to 0s, not left or internal; bottom threes cap both ends but only if at edge for right; unions of above/below 6s for internal evens ensure shared supports; iterative j-increment in content processing avoids rechecking modified cells.
 * All rows copied from input initially, but only even rows fully rebuilt; odd rows only get content replacement; width w assumed uniform across rows.
 * Considerations: Handles multi-row grids (m rows), but assumes even number? No, works for odd m; edge cases like no 6s (no protrusions/closures), all 0s (remains 0s), or isolated 6s (may create single 6 segments without 3s).

 * Content row processing works correctly for 777 replacement, as training passed, but may miss if input has non-7 solids or overlaps not handled.
 * Even row logic separates top/internal/bottom well, with union of 6s helpful for shared supports; training success indicates core support overlay and segment scanning are solid.
 * Protrusion function captures asymmetry but is limited to edges +1 position and ≤4 distance, which worked for training but might under-apply in wider test grids with long overhangs.
 * Closing threes only right-cap adjacent to 0s, which is subtle and likely correct per training, but could miss if segments aren't gap-adjacent or lack 6s.
 * Bottom threes symmetric to closing but left+edge-right, helpful for base cases; no known misses here.
 * Overall program flow (process odds first, then evens with dependencies) is essential and correct, as it allows 6s from content to influence structures.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though protrusion distance cap (hardcoded 4) might be a tuning parameter that's puzzle-specific and not general.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 19-row grid (9 even, 10 odd? Wait, listed as 19 lines but alternating), with patterns like long 8-runs interrupted by 6s, edge 3s, and 0-gaps; it looks visually consistent with a structural diagram (e.g., bridges or shapes supported by 6s, capped by 3s), and since training examples passed, it likely makes sense overall.
 * Specific observations: Row 0 (even): Mostly 8s with a 6 at pos 10, no protrusions visible; Row 1 (odd): 0s then 8-6-8 then 0s, post-content process. Row 2: Starts with 3 (protrusion?), has internal 6s at 10 and 13. Seems to apply rules sequentially.
 * Potential issues: In row 4 (even?): 3 at start, 6 at 13, 3s at 15-16 (protrusion or closing?); row 5 all 0s (gap row?). Row 8: 6 at 4 and 7, 3 at end. Row 10: 3s at 0-1 and 9, 6 at 4, 3 at end – shows multiple 3s, possibly over-applying if protrusions + closing overlap without checks.
 * Row 16 (even?): 6s at 3,12, but no 3s shown, yet below has 8-6-8 at 2-4 and 12-14; might miss closing if no adjacent 0. Row 18: 3 at 0 and 7? 6 at 3 and 12, 3 at end – looks like bottom caps + internal.
 * Overall, test output appears mostly correct and rule-compliant (e.g., 6s aligned across rows, 3s at edges/gaps), but subtle differences possible in protrusion application (e.g., why row 2 has leading 3 but not others? Expected if min_u < min_l); no major mismatches observed without expected output, but distance limit might cause under-protrusion in wide sections (e.g., pos 13-16 in row 2 has extra 6 but no extra 3s beyond edge).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing visual elements like lines, fills, or shapes in a diagram) where rules transform input patterns, particularly propagating "6" markers vertically and horizontally while modifying edges with "3"s and handling special sequences like three consecutive "7"s in odd rows to create asymmetric or directional effects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content rows) are processed by scanning for sequences of three consecutive 7s and replacing them with [8, 6, 8], which introduces a "6" marker in the middle; this skips ahead by 3 positions after replacement to avoid overlapping, but non-7 sequences just increment by 1.
 * Even rows start by converting non-zero cells to 8 (like a base fill), then override positions directly above or below a 6 (from adjacent odd rows) to 6, creating vertical propagation of "6" influences.
 * In even rows, after base filling, identify segments of zeros (empty gaps) and add "3"s to the left or right edges of these segments if the segment contains a 6 nearby; left edges get 3 if above/below 6 favors left (e.g., min position comparison), right edges get 3 conditionally based on max positions or bottom-row presence of 6s, with special handling for the very last segment.
 * Top even row only considers below 6s (no above), bottom even row only considers above 6s and treats it as "is_bottom=True" (no below), internal even rows consider both above and below 6s.
 * Extra rules for even rows: If position 0 is set to 3 and the above min-6 is <=4 positions away, extend 3 to position 1 if it's 8; similarly, if last position is 3 and distance to above max-6 is <=4, extend to second-last if 8— these seem like proximity-based extensions for subtle edge blending.
 * Zeros remain 0 unless overridden, and the process assumes uniform width across rows; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtle: The 3 placements are directional (left-favoring based on min comparisons, right based on max), and bottom row's right-edge logic differs (uses has6_last instead of max comparison); also, the "extras" extensions are asymmetric and only trigger under specific distance thresholds (e.g., <=4), which might handle visual tapering or connection rules.
 * Overall, the rules seem to simulate drawing connections or fills between "object" outlines (8s) with hooks (3s) and markers (6s), possibly for a connect-the-dots or pattern completion puzzle; misses could occur in edge cases like no 6s (inf/-inf mins/maxes), single-row grids, or wide gaps without 6s (no 3s added).
 * Considerations from code: Use sets for 6 positions for efficiency; handle m=1 or m=2 specially to avoid index errors; the segment processing iterates zeros and appends w to catch the end.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set
from math import inf

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    # In-place modifies odd rows: replaces [7,7,7] with [8,6,8], skipping 3 after match.

    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3

    # Core for even rows: base 8 fill, override 6s from above/below union, then add 3s to zero-segment edges based on 6 proximity/min-max comparisons, with extras for extensions.
    # (Full implementation as in the provided code; key for directional 3 placements and bottom special cases.)
    new_row = [0 if input_row[j] == 0 else 8 for j in range(w)]
    all_six = above_six.union(below_six)
    for j in all_six:

    # ... (rest of min/max, zero segments, 3 placements, extras as in code)
    return new_row
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Main orchestrator: copies input, processes odd rows first (777->868), then even rows with appropriate above/below 6s and top/bottom flags.
    # Handles edge cases like m=0,1,2; assumes all rows same width.
    if not g:
        return []
    m = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]

    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt provided, so no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Training example 1 result: CORRECT (program handled the rules accurately for that case).
 * Training example 2 result: CORRECT (demonstrates robustness for varied inputs, like different 7 sequences or 6 propagations).
 * The process_content_row function works well for odd-row 777 replacements but is in-place and assumes no overlapping triples (skips 3 after match, which is correct for non-overlapping).
 * get_six_positions is essential and correct for identifying vertical influences.
 * process_top_even and process_internal_even capture core even-row logic, including 3 placements, but the segment-based 3 logic might be overly complex or miss cases where gaps are at edges (e.g., leading/trailing zeros without 6s get no 3s unless extras trigger).
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the min/max inf handling in internal_even could be brittle if no 6s (defaults to no left/right favoritism).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 19-row grid (alternating even/odd patterns), generated by running the program on an unseen test input; it shows consistent application of rules, e.g., odd rows have 6s and 8s (likely from 777 replacements), even rows have base 8s with 6 overrides (e.g., vertical 6s aligning), and 3s on edges of zero gaps near 6s (e.g., row 4 has 3 at pos 8 and 15-16 near 6 at 13; row 18 has multiple 3s framing 6s and gaps).
 * It makes sense overall: Patterns like repeated [8s, 6, 8s] in odd rows propagate 6s down to even rows, zero segments get 3-bounded where adjacent to 6s (e.g., row 2 has 3 at start and near end 6), and extras extend 3s in places like row 10's leading 3s or row 18's paired 3s— this visually suggests connecting or outlining shapes without breaks.
 * No obvious errors: Zeros stay empty, no invalid numbers, width=17 consistent, bottom row (18) has 3s only where has6_last or above influences (e.g., 6s at 3,12 propagate). If incorrect, it might over-extend 3s in wide gaps (unknown without expected output), but it aligns with rule intent for a coherent visual transformation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (ensuring consistency across both), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties that demonstrably affect or transform into other elements in the outputs, without inferring a full puzzle solution. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts not affecting structure, sporadic gaps in Maroon that do not repeat predictably, or non-interacting bbox edges) are excluded. Unknown aspects of transformations are noted explicitly.

1. **Dark Red horizontal segments → Pink vertical segments (color and shape transformation driven by position)**:
   - **Description**: Each Dark Red component in the input (always horizontal, 3 pixels wide, located at odd y-positions) consistently transforms into a corresponding Pink component in the output. The transformation affects color (Dark Red → Pink), orientation (horizontal → vertical), and extent (3 pixels wide at fixed y → 3 pixels high at fixed x).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - Position (x-center of Dark Red bbox) → Position (x of Pink bbox): The central x-position of the input Dark Red (e.g., midpoint of [3,1,5,1] is x=4) directly determines the fixed x-position of the output Pink.
     - Position (y of Dark Red) → Position (y-span of Pink bbox): The y-position of the input Dark Red determines the vertical span of the Pink, extending from y-1 to y+1 (e.g., Dark Red at y=1 → Pink bbox y=0 to 2).
     - Size (pixels=3) → Size (pixels=3): The pixel count is preserved, but reoriented vertically.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every Dark Red instance across both training inputs/outputs (e.g., input 1 has Dark Red at y=1 centers x=4,10 → output Pinks at x=4/10, y=0-2; input 2 has Dark Red at y=7 centers x=3,11 → output Pinks at x=3/11, y=6-8). No exceptions or non-interacting Dark Red elements.
   - **Notes**: This is the only fully explainable transformation. Pink components do not appear in inputs and are absent in outputs where no corresponding Dark Red exists.

2. **Dark Red/Pink positions → Maroon structure (position affecting segmentation and vertical extension)**:
   - **Description**: Positions of input Dark Red (or their output Pink equivalents) consistently influence the bounding boxes and connectivity of Maroon components, causing Maroon horizontals to segment or extend vertically around Pink locations. Maroon remains the same color but reorganizes from sparse horizontals into larger, multi-row spans.
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - Position (x/y of Dark Red/Pink) → Position and extent (Maroon bbox): Pink verticals act as barriers, splitting adjacent Maroon into separate components or forcing vertical extensions where no Pink interrupts (e.g., in input 1, Dark Red at y=5 x=3/8/15 → output Maroon spans like [1,0,6,8] avoid crossing those x at y=4-6; similar in input 2 around y=5 x=6).
     - Absence of Dark Red/Pink → Maroon vertical connectivity: Rows without Dark Red allow Maroon to merge vertically across multiple even/odd y-levels (e.g., input 2 has no Dark Red at y=9-10 → output Maroon [0,4,6,10] spans y=4-10 uninterrupted).
   - **Consistency**: Holds across all Maroon in both training examples, where output Maroon always aligns with (and avoids overlapping) Pink positions, resulting in linear, grid-aligned structures. No Maroon in outputs ignores Pink placements.
   - **Unknowns**: The exact rule for how input Maroon horizontals are selected/recombined (e.g., why some gaps are filled vertically vs. horizontally) cannot be explained from the data; it is consistent in outcome (sparser, connected lines) but the mapping mechanism is unknown.

3. **Green edge positions → Green edge preservation/adjustment (position affecting horizontal extension)**:
   - **Description**: Input Green components (single-pixel borders at x=0 and x=max-width, primarily at even y) consistently persist in outputs at the same edges, with minor adjustments to maintain boundary coverage alongside Maroon.
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - Position (x=0 or x=max, even y) → Position (x=0 or x=max in output Green bbox): Edge locations are preserved, but bbox may extend horizontally (e.g., from 1 pixel to 2 pixels wide) if adjacent Maroon does not cover the edge (e.g., input 1 Green at [0,2,0,2] → output [0,2,1,2] pixels=2 to bridge to Maroon starting at x=1).
     - Interaction with Maroon coverage → Green size (pixels and bbox width): Green extends (pixels=1 → 2) only where input/output Maroon leaves an edge gap; otherwise, it remains single-pixel or is absorbed (e.g., input 2 at y=10 has Maroon covering edges → output Green single-pixel at [0,10,0,10]).
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all edge Greens in both training examples; outputs never omit edge coverage, and extensions occur precisely where Maroon abuts but does not overlap the edge.
   - **Unknowns**: Mid-grid Greens in outputs (e.g., output 1 at y=12 x=3/9, not present in inputs) have no clear input connection and are inconsistent in placement; their origin or interaction is unknown and not reliably tied to other components.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., hole counts are uniformly 0 and non-interactive; total pixels or overall grid width vary without affecting transformations; no color shifts beyond Dark Red → Pink; no reliable position → color mappings outside the above). Elements like isolated Maroon gaps in inputs do not consistently affect outputs and are excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:33:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a grid of numbers representing a layered structure (likely walls, empties, and content) to generate an output grid with modified walls, holes (6's), and openings (3's), simulating protrusions, closures, and internal features based on alignments of elements across rows, possibly to render cave-like or symbolic shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Odd rows (content layers) replace sequences of three 7's with 8-6-8 to introduce holes (6's) in a symmetric way, skipping forward after replacement to avoid overlap.
 * Even rows (wall layers) start as 8's (solid walls) where input is non-zero, with 0's as empties; 6's are placed where holes align from adjacent rows (above or below).
 * Protrusions (openings as 3's) on wall rows are applied based on misalignment of 6 positions: left protrusion if min above < min below (affecting leftmost 8's within distance 4), right if max above > max below (similarly on right); only for internal walls, not top/bottom.
 * Internal wall rows (not top or bottom) add 3's for openings adjacent to 0's (empties) at segment starts/ends if a segment contains a 6.
 * Bottom wall rows add 3's at segment starts unconditionally if containing a 6, and at right edge if ending there.
 * Subtle edge cases: No protrusions if no above 6's; infinite/min bounds for empty below sets; distance checks (<=4) limit protrusion spread; segments defined by non-0 runs, skipping pure 0's.
 * Top row (i=0) and bottom row (i=m-1) have special handling: top uses no above, bottom no below and uses bottom-specific closures.
 * All modifications are in-place on a copied grid; assumes uniform width w across rows.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping replacements in content rows; protrusion only on edges or adjacent positions (e.g., row[0], row[1] for left); no top-specific closures; 3's only replace 8's, not 6's or 0's.
 * Grid is 0-indexed, rows alternate even (walls) and odd (content); process content first, then walls.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set
import math

def process_content_row(row: List[int]) -> None:
    # Replaces 7-7-7 with 8-6-8 in odd rows, advancing j by 3 on match.
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w - 2:
        if row[j] == 7 and row[j + 1] == 7 and row[j + 2] == 7:
            row[j] = 8
            row[j + 1] = 6
            row[j + 2] = 8
            j += 3
        else:
            j += 1
```

```python
def get_six_positions(row: List[int]) -> Set[int]:
    # Extracts positions of 6's for alignment checks.
    return {j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 6}
```

```python
def apply_protrusion(row: List[int], above_six: Set[int], below_six: Set[int], w: int) -> None:
    # Adds left/right 3's (openings) based on min/max 6 misalignment, limited to edges and nearby positions.
    if not above_six:
        return
    min_u = min(above_six)
    max_u = max(above_six)
    min_l = min(below_six) if below_six else math.inf
    max_l = max(below_six) if below_six else -math.inf
    # left protrusion
    if min_u < min_l:
        if row[0] == 8:
            row[0] = 3
        if min_u <= 4 and w > 1 and row[1] == 8:
            row[1] = 3
    # right protrusion
    if max_u > max_l:
        if row[w - 1] == 8:
            row[w - 1] = 3
        dist = w - 1 - max_u
        if dist <= 4 and w > 1 and row[w - 2] == 8:
            row[w - 2] = 3
```

```python
def apply_internal_closures(row: List[int], w: int) -> None:
    # Adds 3's at segment ends adjacent to 0's if segment has 6 (for internal walls).
    j = 0
    while j < w:
        if row[j] == 0:
            j += 1
            continue
        s = j
        has_6 = False
        while j < w and row[j] != 0:
            if row[j] == 6:
                has_6 = True
            j += 1
        e = j - 1
        if has_6:
            if s > 0 and row[s - 1] == 0 and row[s] == 8:
                row[s] = 3
            if j < w and row[j] == 0 and row[e] == 8:
                row[e] = 3
```

```python
def apply_bottom_closures(row: List[int], w: int) -> None:
    # Similar to internal but unconditional start 3 and only edge-end 3 for bottom walls.
    j = 0
    while j < w:
        if row[j] == 0:
            j += 1
            continue
        s = j
        has_6 = False
        while j < w and row[j] != 0:
            if row[j] == 6:
                has_6 = True
            j += 1
        e = j - 1
        if has_6:
            if row[s] == 8:
                row[s] = 3
            if e == w - 1 and row[e] == 8:
                row[e] = 3
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt passed both training examples correctly, indicating solid handling of basic 7-replacement, 6-alignment, and simple protrusion/closure cases.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates understanding of row alternation (even walls, odd content) and segment-based processing.
 * Protrusion logic works for training (e.g., left/right min/max checks with distance limits), but may miss complex multi-6 alignments or non-edge protrusions.
 * Internal and bottom closures correctly identify segments with 6's and add 3's conditionally, which aligned with training expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (process_content_row, get_six_positions, apply_protrusion, apply_internal_closures, apply_bottom_closures) are relevant and build toward full grid processing in the main program function.
 * Main program copies input grid, processes odds first, then evens with context from adjacent rows; handles top/bottom specially.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 19 rows (alternating walls and presumed content, but output shows processed walls with 3's/6's/8's/0's and some content-like rows), forming irregular shapes with holes (6's) and openings (3's) that appear to represent protrusions and closures, such as left-side 3's in row 4 [3,8,8,...], right-side 3's in row 8 [...8,3], and clustered 6's suggesting aligned features.
 * It looks mostly correct and consistent with rules: e.g., row 2 has 3 at start and 6's placed, row 4 shows protrusions (3's at ends), bottom rows like row 18 have edge 3's; 0's define empty spaces separating segments.
 * However, some subtleties may be mishandled: row 10 [3,3,8,...] has double 3's at start, possibly over-applying left protrusion or closure without adjacent 0 check; row 16 lacks expected right 3 despite potential max_u > max_l (e.g., 6 at position 3 vs below); row 18 ends with 3's that might be bottom closure but could miss internal if not bottom.
 * Overall, the test output makes sense as a plausible rendering of misaligned hole protrusions (e.g., left extensions in upper sections, right in lower), but differences from expected (unknown without target) include potential extra 3's (e.g., row 10) or missing ones (e.g., no protrusion in row 14 despite 6's), suggesting protrusion distance or segment logic needs tuning for complex grids with multiple disconnected 6 groups.
 * No complete breakdown, but it demonstrates core rules (6 placement, basic 3's) without obvious errors like ignoring 7's or wrong row types.

[2025-10-01 22:33:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
