=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:41:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:01:29] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a SameGame-style puzzle where the goal is to simulate a single "move" on a grid of colored blocks (represented by numbers): identify and remove one connected group of 3 or more identical colors that includes the top-left non-zero cell, then apply gravity to make remaining blocks fall down into empty spaces (packing each column from the bottom). The program processes only one such removal and packing step per input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are 4-way (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * The group to remove must be exactly the connected component containing the top-left cell (position [0][0], assuming it's non-zero); do not remove other disconnected groups of the same color, even if they are also size >=3—this is a key subtlety, as the current program removes all large groups of the top-left color, leading to over-removal.
 * Removal only happens if the connected group size is >=3; if <3, no removal or packing occurs (grid unchanged).
 * After removal, empty spaces (0s) are filled by shifting blocks down in each column independently—no horizontal movement or sliding between columns.
 * The top-left cell determines the color to target, but only its specific connected component is considered; other colors or groups are ignored in this step.
 * Grids are variable size but rectangular (e.g., 12x12 in examples); boundaries must be respected in neighbor checks.
 * Subtlety: After packing, new groups may form, but the program only simulates one removal and one packing—no cascading removals in a single step.
 * If the top-left is already 0, likely no action (but examples suggest inputs have non-zero there).
 * Outputs must match exactly, including positions of remaining blocks after packing; minor shifts (e.g., wrong column packing) cause mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: Packing starts from the bottom of each column, collecting non-zeros and placing them at the bottom, leaving 0s at the top—reversing this (e.g., packing from top) would fail.
 * In examples, removals create "islands" that pack differently; e.g., isolated blocks stay in their columns but shift down.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful and mostly correct, with minor tweaks needed (e.g., to target only the top-left component):
```python
def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
```python
def find_component(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, target_color: int, visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    stack = [(r, c)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != target_color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, len(g), len(g[0])):
            stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Note: This uses DFS via stack; it's correct for finding one component but should be called only once for the top-left cell, not iterated over the whole grid.)
```python
def pack_column_from_bottom(g: List[List[int]], c: int):
    rows = len(g)
    non_zeros = [g[r][c] for r in range(rows) if g[r][c] != 0]
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < rows - len(non_zeros):
            g[r][c] = 0
        else:
            g[r][c] = non_zeros[r - (rows - len(non_zeros))]
```
```python
def apply_packing_gravity(g: List[List[int]]):
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```
(The overall program structure is helpful: deepcopy input, get color from [0][0], conditionally remove and pack.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `remove_large_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> bool`: Broken for this puzzle—it iterates over the entire grid and removes ALL connected components of the target color that are >=3, instead of only the one containing [0][0]. This causes over-removal (e.g., multiple groups cleared when only one should be). Do not use as-is; modify to call `find_component` only on (0,0) and remove if len >=3.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt provided; it succeeded on Training example 1 (likely because the top-left color had only one large group, so removing all large groups of that color coincidentally matched removing just the top-left one).
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output cleared far too many cells (e.g., entire columns to 0s at top, with scattered remnants like 2s and 8s not packed correctly), resulting in a mostly empty grid; expected keeps more structure (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 9s and 5s packed in columns 2-3, 2s in column 5, 7s and 3s lower down)—difference is over-removal of multiple 5/7/3/2/8/9 groups of the top-left color, instead of just one group.
 * Failed on Training example 3: Generated has excessive clearing (e.g., many 0s at top, 2s partially removed and poorly packed, 4s/5s/9s scattered); expected preserves more (e.g., 6 at bottom-left, 8s packed in column 9, 5s/2s/7s/3s/4s in specific lower positions)—again, over-removal of multiple groups of the same color (likely top-left is 6 or similar), leaving wrong packing (e.g., 5s not grouped as in expected).
 * Failed on Training example 4: Generated packs incorrectly after removal (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/7 groups shifted wrong, with 0s not fully at top and blocks like 2s/7s not falling fully); expected has cleaner packing (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 5s/1s stacked in column 4, 3s/6s/5s/7s lower with 0s above)—issue is removing too much (possibly multiple 2/7 groups) and flawed packing (e.g., 1s not consolidated).
 * Failed on Training example 5: Similar to 4, generated has wrong shifts (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/4/7 groups not packed from bottom correctly, 0s misplaced); expected isolates 7 at bottom-left, packs 5s/1s higher with 0s below them incorrectly in generated—over-removal (multiple 2/4 groups) and packing bug (non-zeros not collected properly, leading to mid-column 0s).
 * Across attempts (inferred from pattern), the core issue is treating the move as "remove all large groups of top-left color" instead of "remove only the connected group containing top-left cell"; this works coincidentally for simple cases (train 1) but fails when multiple disconnected groups exist.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level analysis attempted, but not needed—direct component finding suffices.
 * Copy.deepcopy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Visited set prevents re-processing but is underused (iterates whole grid unnecessarily).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows partial removal and packing (e.g., 4s/3s/6s/5s/1s/2s/9s/7 shifted down, but with excessive 0s at top and incomplete consolidation—e.g., 1s/2s/5s not fully packed in columns 6-9, 9s isolated in column 10), suggesting over-removal of multiple groups (likely of color 7 or 3 from bottom-left/top). This mismatches the expected behavior, which should only remove the specific connected group including [0][0] (probably a small 7 or similar at bottom, but wait—grids are printed top-to-bottom, so [0][0] is top-left, likely a high number or 0? Input not shown, but output has 0s at top post-pack, implying removal affected upper areas wrong). To fix, mentally simulating: Assume input has top-left as, say, 7; only remove its connected >=3 group (e.g., the 1s/2s chain at bottom), then pack—expected would have 7 isolated at bottom-left, 3s/4s/6s/5s/8?/9 falling in their columns without clearing unrelated 5s/2s. The output clears too much (e.g., 8s gone, 5s scattered), confirming the multi-group removal bug; it does not make sense as a single-move simulation.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

 * Across attempts (inferred from pattern), the core issue is treating the move as "remove all large groups of top-left color" instead of "remove only the connected group containing top-left cell"; this works coincidentally for simple cases (train 1) but fails when multiple disconnected groups exist.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level analysis attempted, but not needed—direct component finding suffices.
 * Copy.deepcopy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Visited set prevents re-processing but is underused (iterates whole grid unnecessarily).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows partial removal and packing (e.g., 4s/3s/6s/5s/1s/2s/9s/7 shifted down, but with excessive 0s at top and incomplete consolidation—e.g., 1s/2s/5s not fully packed in columns 6-9, 9s isolated in column 10), suggesting over-removal of multiple groups (likely of color 7 or 3 from bottom-left/top). This mismatches the expected behavior, which should only remove the specific connected group including [0][0] (probably a small 7 or similar at bottom, but wait—grids are printed top-to-bottom, so [0][0] is top-left, likely a high number or 0? Input not shown, but output has 0s at top post-pack, implying removal affected upper areas wrong). To fix, mentally simulating: Assume input has top-left as, say, 7; only remove its connected >=3 group (e.g., the 1s/2s chain at bottom), then pack—expected would have 7 isolated at bottom-left, 3s/4s/6s/5s/8?/9 falling in their columns without clearing unrelated 5s/2s. The output clears too much (e.g., 8s gone, 5s scattered), confirming the multi-group removal bug; it does not make sense as a single-move simulation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:16:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored blocks, where connected groups (likely 4-way adjacent) of 3 or more identical numbers are removed, followed by gravity that causes the remaining blocks to fall down in their columns while preserving relative order, filling from the bottom with empty spaces (0s) at the top. The goal of the program is to simulate one step of this process on the input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected groups are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * Only groups of size 3 or more are removed; smaller groups or singles stay.
 * After removal, gravity is applied per column: collect all remaining non-zero values in their original top-to-bottom order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column (row index len-1 downward), with 0s filling the top rows—no gaps allowed in any column after packing.
 * The program always applies gravity, even if no removal occurs, which could incorrectly pack grids that already have no gaps.
 * Row 0 is the top row, row len-1 is the bottom; empty space at top after gravity.
 * Likely only one specific group is removed per step (not all groups), but the current logic picks the wrong one (connected to (0,0) only if non-zero); possible rules include removing the largest group, the group touching the bottom-left, or the group with the topmost/leftmost cell.
 * Subtlety: If top-left (0,0) is 0, no removal happens, but gravity still runs, potentially altering stable grids incorrectly.
 * Repeated removal/gravity cycles may be needed if new groups form after falling, but expected outputs still show remaining groups of 3+, suggesting single removal + single gravity only.
 * Inputs likely have no initial gaps (full or near-full grids), so incorrect removal leads to wrong post-gravity configurations.
 * Expected outputs show configurations with what appear to be gaps in some columns (e.g., non-zeros separated by 0s in the same column), which contradicts full per-column packing—possibly indicating that gravity only fills specific holes from removals (not full repack), or that multiple selective removals occur without full repacking each time, or even that 0s are not treated as empty spaces for falling.
 * Different training examples have varying bottom-left values (e.g., 9 in train1, 4 in train4, 7 in train5), which appear in generated bottoms but in expected "top-left singles," suggesting the removal logic misses the key group containing that cell.
 * Unclear if removal happens before or after any initial gravity, or if the grid wraps/ has special rules for edges.

    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements 4-way connected component finding via DFS/stack, removal by setting to 0, and per-column gravity packing to the bottom preserving order—these are solid building blocks.
 * Gravity packing works as intended (no gaps in columns post-pack in generated outputs), but expected outputs appear to have gaps in some columns (e.g., train1 col4 has non-zeros at rows 2-5 and 8, with 0s at 6-7 and 9-11), suggesting either partial falling (only above removed cells) instead of full repack, or multiple steps, or that 0s don't allow passing through.
 * Removal logic is broken: only targets component from fixed (0,0) if non-zero there, leading to no removal or wrong group in all cases; e.g., train1 generated packs everything to bottom with intact large 2-group at bottom and 9 at bottom-left, but expected isolates 9 at top-left, connects 1's horizontally/vertically, and leaves scattered groups like 5's and 3's with apparent gaps.
 * Train1: Generated fully packs to bottom (e.g., 9 at row11 col0, 4's stacked at row8-11 col1, big 2's at row11 col2-9), but expected has 9 isolated at row0 col0, 4's at row8-11 col1 (correct pack for that column), but gaps in col2 (6's at row5-7, 2 at row8, 0s below) and col4 (5's at row2-4, 3 at row5, 2 at row8, 0s elsewhere)—different because wrong group removed, no gaps in generated.
 * Train2: Generated packs to bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, 6's stacked at row9-11 col1, 9's at row8-10 col2), but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 6's at row9-11 col1 and scattered 0s/gaps in col2 (9 at row6-8, 5 at row9, 0 at row10, etc.)—mismatch in isolated 4 position and gaps; unknown why 5's connect horizontally in row5 but not packed fully.
 * Train3: Similar to train2, generated packs to bottom (6 at row11 col0), expected has 6 at row0 col0, with gaps like 0s interrupting 9's and 5's in lower rows—wrong starting cell for component finding leads to no/different removal.
 * Train4: Generated has 4 at row11 col0, packs big 2's to row11, but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 1's connected but isolated 5's vertical with gaps below—no removal of 1's group in generated, but expected shows partial connections and bottom-packed 2's/7's without the upper clutter.
 * Train5: Generated has 7 at row11 col0, packs to bottom, but expected has 7 at row0 col0, with 5's and 1's scattered low with gaps (e.g., col4 has 5 at row6-8, but 0s below)—mismatch in single 7 position and failure to connect/remove specific groups like 1's.
 * The find_top_left_component function is broken for cases where (0,0) is 0 (skips removal entirely) or when the target group isn't connected to (0,0); not helpful as-is, modify to find the correct starting cell (e.g., bottom-left or largest group).
 * deepcopy is helpful for non-mutating the input.
 * Overall, attempt misunderstands which group to remove (likely not top-left), leading to incorrect configurations; gravity is applied but on wrong post-removal grid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed pattern as training examples: full packing to bottom with no gaps (e.g., 7 at row11 col0, 3's stacked at row9-11 col1, 1's at row11 col2-4, 2's at row11 col6-9, 9's at row10-11 col10), suggesting a removal (possibly of a top group including 4's and others) but wrong one, since training shows similar bottom-packed results are incorrect.
 * It leaves potential groups intact (e.g., vertical 3's in col4 rows4-6? Wait, row4 col4=3, row5=3, row6=3, row7=3? row7 col4=3 yes, 4 connected 3's not removed; horizontal 7's in row7 col7,10? scattered), and isolates pieces like single 6 at row8 col2, but expected likely wants a single at top-left (perhaps the 7) and specific connections/gaps as in training.
 * Does not match likely correct output, which should remove a key group (e.g., the 1's at bottom row11 col2-4 connected to row10 col3-4? or 2's at row11 col6-9), then gravity with possible apparent gaps if partial falling, resulting in something like [7,0,0...] at top and reconnected pieces lower without full bottom-packing of everything.
 * To handle test, update to find/remove the connected group starting from bottom-left cell (row11 col0=7), as patterns suggest bottom-left value ends up isolated at top-left after correct removal + gravity.

 * Connected groups are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * Only groups of size 3 or more are removed; smaller groups or singles stay.
 * After removal, gravity is applied per column: collect all remaining non-zero values in their original top-to-bottom order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column (row index len-1 downward), with 0s filling the top rows—no gaps allowed in any column after packing.
 * The program always applies gravity, even if no removal occurs, which could incorrectly pack grids that already have no gaps.
 * Row 0 is the top row, row len-1 is the bottom; empty space at top after gravity.
 * Likely only one specific group is removed per step (not all groups), but the current logic picks the wrong one (connected to (0,0) only if non-zero); possible rules include removing the largest group, the group touching the bottom-left, or the group with the topmost/leftmost cell.
 * Subtlety: If top-left (0,0) is 0, no removal happens, but gravity still runs, potentially altering stable grids incorrectly.
 * Repeated removal/gravity cycles may be needed if new groups form after falling, but expected outputs still show remaining groups of 3+, suggesting single removal + single gravity only.
 * Inputs likely have no initial gaps (full or near-full grids), so incorrect removal leads to wrong post-gravity configurations.
 * Expected outputs show configurations with what appear to be gaps in some columns (e.g., non-zeros separated by 0s in the same column), which contradicts full per-column packing—possibly indicating that gravity only fills specific holes from removals (not full repack), or that multiple selective removals occur without full repacking each time, or even that 0s are not treated as empty spaces for falling.
 * Different training examples have varying bottom-left values (e.g., 9 in train1, 4 in train4, 7 in train5), which appear in generated bottoms but in expected "top-left singles," suggesting the removal logic misses the key group containing that cell.
 * Unclear if removal happens before or after any initial gravity, or if the grid wraps/ has special rules for edges.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements 4-way connected component finding via DFS/stack, removal by setting to 0, and per-column gravity packing to the bottom preserving order—these are solid building blocks.
 * Gravity packing works as intended (no gaps in columns post-pack in generated outputs), but expected outputs appear to have gaps in some columns (e.g., train1 col4 has non-zeros at rows 2-5 and 8, with 0s at 6-7 and 9-11), suggesting either partial falling (only above removed cells) instead of full repack, or multiple steps, or that 0s don't allow passing through.
 * Removal logic is broken: only targets component from fixed (0,0) if non-zero there, leading to no removal or wrong group in all cases; e.g., train1 generated packs everything to bottom with intact large 2-group at bottom and 9 at bottom-left, but expected isolates 9 at top-left, connects 1's horizontally/vertically, and leaves scattered groups like 5's and 3's with apparent gaps.
 * Train1: Generated fully packs to bottom (e.g., 9 at row11 col0, 4's stacked at row8-11 col1, big 2's at row11 col2-9), but expected has 9 isolated at row0 col0, 4's at row8-11 col1 (correct pack for that column), but gaps in col2 (6's at row5-7, 2 at row8, 0s below) and col4 (5's at row2-4, 3 at row5, 2 at row8, 0s elsewhere)—different because wrong group removed, no gaps in generated.
 * Train2: Generated packs to bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, 6's stacked at row9-11 col1, 9's at row8-10 col2), but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 6's at row9-11 col1 and scattered 0s/gaps in col2 (9 at row6-8, 5 at row9, 0 at row10, etc.)—mismatch in isolated 4 position and gaps; unknown why 5's connect horizontally in row5 but not packed fully.
 * Train3: Similar to train2, generated packs to bottom (6 at row11 col0), expected has 6 at row0 col0, with gaps like 0s interrupting 9's and 5's in lower rows—wrong starting cell for component finding leads to no/different removal.
 * Train4: Generated has 4 at row11 col0, packs big 2's to row11, but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 1's connected but isolated 5's vertical with gaps below—no removal of 1's group in generated, but expected shows partial connections and bottom-packed 2's/7's without the upper clutter.
 * Train5: Generated has 7 at row11 col0, packs to bottom, but expected has 7 at row0 col0, with 5's and 1's scattered low with gaps (e.g., col4 has 5 at row6-8, but 0s below)—mismatch in single 7 position and failure to connect/remove specific groups like 1's.
 * The find_top_left_component function is broken for cases where (0,0) is 0 (skips removal entirely) or when the target group isn't connected to (0,0); not helpful as-is, modify to find the correct starting cell (e.g., bottom-left or largest group).
 * deepcopy is helpful for non-mutating the input.
 * Overall, attempt misunderstands which group to remove (likely not top-left), leading to incorrect configurations; gravity is applied but on wrong post-removal grid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed pattern as training examples: full packing to bottom with no gaps (e.g., 7 at row11 col0, 3's stacked at row9-11 col1, 1's at row11 col2-4, 2's at row11 col6-9, 9's at row10-11 col10), suggesting a removal (possibly of a top group including 4's and others) but wrong one, since training shows similar bottom-packed results are incorrect.
 * It leaves potential groups intact (e.g., vertical 3's in col4 rows4-6? Wait, row4 col4=3, row5=3, row6=3, row7=3? row7 col4=3 yes, 4 connected 3's not removed; horizontal 7's in row7 col7,10? scattered), and isolates pieces like single 6 at row8 col2, but expected likely wants a single at top-left (perhaps the 7) and specific connections/gaps as in training.
 * Does not match likely correct output, which should remove a key group (e.g., the 1's at bottom row11 col2-4 connected to row10 col3-4? or 2's at row11 col6-9), then gravity with possible apparent gaps if partial falling, resulting in something like [7,0,0...] at top and reconnected pieces lower without full bottom-packing of everything.
 * To handle test, update to find/remove the connected group starting from bottom-left cell (row11 col0=7), as patterns suggest bottom-left value ends up isolated at top-left after correct removal + gravity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a SameGame-style puzzle where the goal is to simulate a single "move" on a grid of colored blocks (represented by numbers): identify and remove one connected group of 3 or more identical colors that includes the top-left non-zero cell, then apply gravity to make remaining blocks fall down into empty spaces (packing each column from the bottom). The program processes only one such removal and packing step per input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are 4-way (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * The group to remove must be exactly the connected component containing the top-left cell (position [0][0], assuming it's non-zero); do not remove other disconnected groups of the same color, even if they are also size >=3—this is a key subtlety, as the current program removes all large groups of the top-left color, leading to over-removal.
 * Removal only happens if the connected group size is >=3; if <3, no removal or packing occurs (grid unchanged).
 * After removal, empty spaces (0s) are filled by shifting blocks down in each column independently—no horizontal movement or sliding between columns.
 * The top-left cell determines the color to target, but only its specific connected component is considered; other colors or groups are ignored in this step.
 * Grids are variable size but rectangular (e.g., 12x12 in examples); boundaries must be respected in neighbor checks.
 * Subtlety: After packing, new groups may form, but the program only simulates one removal and one packing—no cascading removals in a single step.
 * If the top-left is already 0, likely no action (but examples suggest inputs have non-zero there).
 * Outputs must match exactly, including positions of remaining blocks after packing; minor shifts (e.g., wrong column packing) cause mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: Packing starts from the bottom of each column, collecting non-zeros and placing them at the bottom, leaving 0s at the top—reversing this (e.g., packing from top) would fail.
 * In examples, removals create "islands" that pack differently; e.g., isolated blocks stay in their columns but shift down.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful and mostly correct, with minor tweaks needed (e.g., to target only the top-left component):
```python
def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
```python
def find_component(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, target_color: int, visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    stack = [(r, c)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != target_color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, len(g), len(g[0])):
            stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Note: This uses DFS via stack; it's correct for finding one component but should be called only once for the top-left cell, not iterated over the whole grid.)
```python
def pack_column_from_bottom(g: List[List[int]], c: int):
    rows = len(g)
    non_zeros = [g[r][c] for r in range(rows) if g[r][c] != 0]
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < rows - len(non_zeros):
            g[r][c] = 0
        else:
            g[r][c] = non_zeros[r - (rows - len(non_zeros))]
```
```python
def apply_packing_gravity(g: List[List[int]]):
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```
(The overall program structure is helpful: deepcopy input, get color from [0][0], conditionally remove and pack.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `remove_large_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> bool`: Broken for this puzzle—it iterates over the entire grid and removes ALL connected components of the target color that are >=3, instead of only the one containing [0][0]. This causes over-removal (e.g., multiple groups cleared when only one should be). Do not use as-is; modify to call `find_component` only on (0,0) and remove if len >=3.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt provided; it succeeded on Training example 1 (likely because the top-left color had only one large group, so removing all large groups of that color coincidentally matched removing just the top-left one).
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output cleared far too many cells (e.g., entire columns to 0s at top, with scattered remnants like 2s and 8s not packed correctly), resulting in a mostly empty grid; expected keeps more structure (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 9s and 5s packed in columns 2-3, 2s in column 5, 7s and 3s lower down)—difference is over-removal of multiple 5/7/3/2/8/9 groups of the top-left color, instead of just one group.
 * Failed on Training example 3: Generated has excessive clearing (e.g., many 0s at top, 2s partially removed and poorly packed, 4s/5s/9s scattered); expected preserves more (e.g., 6 at bottom-left, 8s packed in column 9, 5s/2s/7s/3s/4s in specific lower positions)—again, over-removal of multiple groups of the same color (likely top-left is 6 or similar), leaving wrong packing (e.g., 5s not grouped as in expected).
 * Failed on Training example 4: Generated packs incorrectly after removal (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/7 groups shifted wrong, with 0s not fully at top and blocks like 2s/7s not falling fully); expected has cleaner packing (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 5s/1s stacked in column 4, 3s/6s/5s/7s lower with 0s above)—issue is removing too much (possibly multiple 2/7 groups) and flawed packing (e.g., 1s not consolidated).
 * Failed on Training example 5: Similar to 4, generated has wrong shifts (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/4/7 groups not packed from bottom correctly, 0s misplaced); expected isolates 7 at bottom-left, packs 5s/1s higher with 0s below them incorrectly in generated—over-removal (multiple 2/4 groups) and packing bug (non-zeros not collected properly, leading to mid-column 0s).
 * Across attempts (inferred from pattern), the core issue is treating the move as "remove all large groups of top-left color" instead of "remove only the connected group containing top-left cell"; this works coincidentally for simple cases (train 1) but fails when multiple disconnected groups exist.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level analysis attempted, but not needed—direct component finding suffices.
 * Copy.deepcopy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Visited set prevents re-processing but is underused (iterates whole grid unnecessarily).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows partial removal and packing (e.g., 4s/3s/6s/5s/1s/2s/9s/7 shifted down, but with excessive 0s at top and incomplete consolidation—e.g., 1s/2s/5s not fully packed in columns 6-9, 9s isolated in column 10), suggesting over-removal of multiple groups (likely of color 7 or 3 from bottom-left/top). This mismatches the expected behavior, which should only remove the specific connected group including [0][0] (probably a small 7 or similar at bottom, but wait—grids are printed top-to-bottom, so [0][0] is top-left, likely a high number or 0? Input not shown, but output has 0s at top post-pack, implying removal affected upper areas wrong). To fix, mentally simulating: Assume input has top-left as, say, 7; only remove its connected >=3 group (e.g., the 1s/2s chain at bottom), then pack—expected would have 7 isolated at bottom-left, 3s/4s/6s/5s/8?/9 falling in their columns without clearing unrelated 5s/2s. The output clears too much (e.g., 8s gone, 5s scattered), confirming the multi-group removal bug; it does not make sense as a single-move simulation.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python

[2025-09-30 19:29:33] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a match-3 style puzzle game simulation where groups of 3 or more orthogonally connected cells (4-way adjacency: up, down, left, right) with the same value (color) are identified and removed in a single step, after which the remaining cells in each column fall down due to gravity and pack tightly from the bottom, leaving empty (0) spaces at the top. The program seems intended to process one such step starting from the top-left cell's color, but it includes flawed logic for handling cases where the initial component is too small, leading to incorrect removals and packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are strictly 4-way (no diagonals), and components must be exactly the same value to count as connected; isolated or smaller groups (<3 cells) are not removed.
 * Removal happens only for components of size >=3; the program searches for such components of the initial top-left color (C) if the starting one is too small, but this leads to over-removal or incorrect targeting in some cases.
 * After removal, gravity applies per column independently: non-zero cells slide down to the bottom, filling from row len-1 upward, with zeros pushed to the top; this must preserve the exact order of surviving cells in each column.
 * Subtle issue: The program modifies the grid in-place but has a hacky restoration step (if initial component <3, reset h[0][0] to C and set h[-1][0] to 0), which incorrectly reinserts or clears cells unrelated to the puzzle rules, causing mismatches like extra zeros or misplaced values.
 * Empty grid or all-zero top-left (C=0) should return unchanged; deep copy is used to avoid mutating input.
 * Puzzle likely assumes fixed 12x12 grid size based on outputs, but rows/cols are dynamic; no horizontal shifting or wrapping.
 * Multiple components of the same color may exist, but only those >=3 are removed—program attempts to find them but visits incorrectly, potentially missing or double-counting.
 * After packing, no further matches are resolved in this step; it's a single removal + gravity operation.
 * Expected outputs show specific patterns like horizontal lines of 1's or 5's forming after packing, vertical stacks preserving order, and isolated cells dropping correctly without merging different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Packing must collect non-zeros in their original top-to-bottom order and place them at the bottom; reversing or shuffling breaks this (e.g., in Train 1, generated has duplicated rows like [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] twice, indicating failed packing).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from copy import deepcopy

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```

```python
def find_connected_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not g or g[start_r][start_c] == 0:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    color = g[start_r][start_c]
    visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(start_r, start_c)]
    component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
            if (nr, nc) not in visited and g[nr][nc] == color:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```

```python
def remove_component_cells(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    for r, c in component:
        g[r][c] = 0
```

```python
def pack_column_from_bottom(g: List[List[int]], col: int) -> None:
    rows = len(g)
    non_zeros = [g[r][col] for r in range(rows) if g[r][col] != 0]
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < rows - len(non_zeros):
            g[r][col] = 0
        else:
            g[r][col] = non_zeros[r - (rows - len(non_zeros))]
```

```python
def apply_gravity_packing(g: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```
These functions correctly handle neighbor finding, DFS-based component extraction (using stack for iterative search), in-place zeroing, and per-column gravity packing (preserves order by collecting non-zeros top-to-bottom and placing at bottom).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a deep copy and correctly identifies the initial color C from top-left, but fails to remove only valid (>=3) components of that color without side effects.
 * Component finding works for isolated groups (e.g., stack-based DFS avoids recursion issues), but the main logic over-searches: if initial component <3, it scans the entire grid for other C-components >=3 and removes them, which succeeds in some vertical drops but causes incorrect packing in others (e.g., duplicates rows or fails to drop properly).
 * Packing functions are helpful and mostly correct, but applied after flawed removal, leading to zeros not fully propagating to top (e.g., in Train 1 generated, row 7 has [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] which should have dropped further to match expected horizontal 1's and 5's).
 * The restoration hack (if len(component)<3, set h[0][0]=C and h[-1][0]=0) is broken and unhelpful: it reinserts C incorrectly (e.g., in Train 1, places 9 at top but messes bottom-left), causing mismatches like extra 9's or cleared cells unrelated to rules—remove this entirely.
 * Train 1: Generated has incorrect packing (e.g., duplicated [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] rows, 1's not horizontally connected/dropped as in expected [0,0,0,0,5,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]), and bottom row [0,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,0] misses expected vertical 7's stacking; differs from expected by failing to remove a >=3 group of 1's or 5's properly.
 * Train 2: Generated packs some 2's and 5's but leaves gaps (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] instead of expected merged 5's), and bottom [0,6,5,5,0,1,7,7,7,7,3,0] has extra 5's not dropped; differs by not removing a horizontal 7's or vertical 5's group.
 * Train 3: Generated drops 2's but fails to connect 5's horizontally (row 4 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,2,5,5,5,8,0,0]), and 4's/3's not packed correctly; differs by missing removal of 4's group and incorrect 7's/3's stacking.
 * Train 4: Similar to Train 1, generated has undropped 1's/5's (row 7 [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] vs expected row 5 equivalent), and 3's not horizontally removed/packed; bottom row correct but mid-grid gaps persist.
 * Train 5: Generated clears too much (e.g., row 8 [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,0,0,0] misses expected 1's connection), and packs 2's/3's incorrectly without horizontal 1's forming; differs by not removing scattered 1's or 5's properly, leading to partial drops.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of components and gravity but fails due to flawed main logic (over-removal + hack); no extraction of all objects attempted, but component finder could be extended to scan all >=3 groups regardless of starting color (subtle: puzzle may remove all matching groups in one step, not just of C).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows partial drops (e.g., row 4 [0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] with isolated 4/3 not packed down fully, row 8 [0,0,6,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0] with 5's not connected horizontally as likely expected, bottom row [0,3,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,9,0] suggesting a 1's group and 2's group were removed but 5/9 not handled right).
 * Compared to puzzle rules, it seems to have removed some >=3 groups (e.g., possible 1's horizontal and 2's horizontal at bottom), but packing is incomplete—e.g., column 2 has 4's stacked mid-grid instead of bottom, column 10 has 9's not dropping alone; expected likely has tighter bottom-packing like vertical 3's/5's/9's and horizontal connections post-drop (e.g., 5's merging in col 6-7).
 * Differs from sensible output by leaving mid-grid gaps (e.g., row 9 [0,3,6,3,1,0,2,5,0,0,9,0] has scattered values that should drop per column), and top 7 unchanged but possibly irrelevant; unknown why 8's in col 6 didn't drop fully or if a 5's group was missed—output looks like partial simulation without full grid scan for all removable components.
 * To handle test, program needs to find/remove ALL >=3 components of ANY color (not just C), then pack; current version ties to top-left, causing misses.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 19:30:19] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs (1-5), below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** between components or properties. These are limited to patterns that hold **in every train example** (including cases with no change, like train 1). I focused only on elements with clear, direct effects or dependencies (e.g., one property influencing another's presence or state). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., components that never interact) are excluded. Inconsistent or sporadic patterns (e.g., variable downward shifts in position, which occur but vary by example without a clear uniform trigger across all) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided—only pairwise connections.

Components are defined by their key properties: **color** (categorical identifier), **bbox** (position and extent: [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y]), **pixels** (size indicator), and **holes** (always 0, no variation or interaction observed).

#### 1. **Top-Left 1x1 Component's Color → Removal of Matching-Color Components**
   - **Description**: The color of the isolated 1x1 component (always at bbox=[0,0,0,0], pixels=1) directly determines the fate of all other components with the exact same color. All matching-color components (excluding the top-left itself) are completely removed/absent in the output. No partial removal, color change, or relocation occurs for them.
   - **Affected Properties**: Presence of components (removed if color matches); no effect on bbox, pixels, or holes of non-matching components.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Top-left Light Blue; no other Light Blue components → 0 removals (consistent, no action needed).
     - Train 2: Top-left Yellow; other Yellow components (mid-horizontal at [3,6,5,6] pixels=3; bottom-right vertical at [10,9,10,11] pixels=3) → both removed.
     - Train 3: Top-left Pink; other Pink component (bottom-left vertical at [1,9,1,11] pixels=3) → removed.
     - Train 4: Top-left Yellow; other Yellow component (bottom-left vertical at [1,8,1,11] pixels=4) → removed.
     - Train 5: Top-left Dark Red; other Dark Red components (mid-right vertical at [9,5,9,7] pixels=3; bottom-right vertical at [10,8,10,11] pixels=4) → both removed.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color → presence (unidirectional effect; top-left color acts as a "filter" for removal).
   - **Notes**: This is the only transformation observed in **every** example. Total pixels in output are reduced by the exact sum of removed components' pixels (no compensation or redistribution observed consistently). No effect if no matches exist.

#### 2. **Top-Left 1x1 Component → Its Own Stability (No Interaction with Others)**
   - **Description**: The top-left 1x1 component (bbox=[0,0,0,0], pixels=1) remains completely unchanged, regardless of other components or transformations. Its color, position, and size are isolated and unaffected by any other elements.
   - **Affected Properties**: Its own bbox, pixels, color, and presence (fixed).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**: Identical input/output for this component in every pair (e.g., Light Blue in train 1; Yellow in trains 2/4; Pink in train 3; Dark Red in train 5).
   - **Interaction Type**: Self-contained stability (no observed effect on/from other components; it does not influence non-removal transformations like position shifts).
   - **Notes**: While isolated, this is consistently "interconnected" to the removal rule above (its color affects others, but nothing affects it). It never integrates or moves, even when other components shift.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Interactions
- **Position (bbox) Changes in Remaining Components**: Many non-removed components exhibit bbox shifts (often downward in min_y/max_y, e.g., +2 to +5 units in trains 2-5), but the trigger, amount, and direction vary (e.g., uniform +3 in train 4 vs. mixed +2/+3 in train 2 vs. 0 in train 1). No single property (e.g., adjacency to removed components, color, or pixels) consistently explains the transformation across all examples. Some cases extend bbox height or alter shape (e.g., Red pixels 4→5 in train 2), but this is not uniform.
- **Merging of Same-Color Components**: Observed in train 4 (two Dark Red components combine post-shift: pixels 3+4=7, bbox union [9,8,10,11]), but absent in other trains (no opportunity or no occurrence in trains 1-3/5). Not consistent across every example, so not listed as a core interaction—possibly dependent on post-removal position proximity (unknown).
- **Pixels Changes in Non-Merged Components**: Total pixels decrease by removed amounts (consistent with rule 1), but isolated increases (e.g., Red pixels +1 in train 2) occur sporadically without a clear trigger (e.g., no consistent link to adjacent removals or colors).
- **Color → Color Effects**: No color changes or new colors created in any output. Colors are preserved for non-removed components, but no further interactions (e.g., no blending or propagation) observed consistently.
- **Holes**: Always 0 in input/output; no interaction or change.
- **Other Position → Position Effects**: Adjacency or overlap in input does not consistently predict output positions (e.g., some adjacent groups shift together in train 4, but split/vary in train 2). Unknown trigger.

No forced connections (e.g., semantic shapes or unobservable properties like "edges/holes affecting movement") were inferred, as they are not evident from the provided bbox/pixels/color data. Only the removal rule qualifies as obvious, direct, and universal across all trains. Test inputs were not analyzed for patterns, as the task focuses on train consistency.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:33:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored blocks, where connected groups (likely 4-way adjacent) of 3 or more identical numbers are removed, followed by gravity that causes the remaining blocks to fall down in their columns while preserving relative order, filling from the bottom with empty spaces (0s) at the top. The goal of the program is to simulate one step of this process on the input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected groups are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * Only groups of size 3 or more are removed; smaller groups or singles stay.
 * After removal, gravity is applied per column: collect all remaining non-zero values in their original top-to-bottom order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column (row index len-1 downward), with 0s filling the top rows—no gaps allowed in any column after packing.
 * The program always applies gravity, even if no removal occurs, which could incorrectly pack grids that already have no gaps.
 * Row 0 is the top row, row len-1 is the bottom; empty space at top after gravity.
 * Likely only one specific group is removed per step (not all groups), but the current logic picks the wrong one (connected to (0,0) only if non-zero); possible rules include removing the largest group, the group touching the bottom-left, or the group with the topmost/leftmost cell.
 * Subtlety: If top-left (0,0) is 0, no removal happens, but gravity still runs, potentially altering stable grids incorrectly.
 * Repeated removal/gravity cycles may be needed if new groups form after falling, but expected outputs still show remaining groups of 3+, suggesting single removal + single gravity only.
 * Inputs likely have no initial gaps (full or near-full grids), so incorrect removal leads to wrong post-gravity configurations.
 * Expected outputs show configurations with what appear to be gaps in some columns (e.g., non-zeros separated by 0s in the same column), which contradicts full per-column packing—possibly indicating that gravity only fills specific holes from removals (not full repack), or that multiple selective removals occur without full repacking each time, or even that 0s are not treated as empty spaces for falling.
 * Different training examples have varying bottom-left values (e.g., 9 in train1, 4 in train4, 7 in train5), which appear in generated bottoms but in expected "top-left singles," suggesting the removal logic misses the key group containing that cell.
 * Unclear if removal happens before or after any initial gravity, or if the grid wraps/ has special rules for edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```

```python
def find_connected_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Modified from original: starts from any (start_r, start_c) instead of fixed (0,0)
    # Uses DFS to find all connected cells with same value as g[start_r][start_c]
    if not g or g[start_r][start_c] == 0:

    non_zeros = [g[r][col] for r in range(rows) if g[r][col] != 0]
    offset = rows - len(non_zeros)
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < offset:
            g[r][col] = 0
        else:
            g[r][col] = non_zeros[r - offset]
```

        return
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements 4-way connected component finding via DFS/stack, removal by setting to 0, and per-column gravity packing to the bottom preserving order—these are solid building blocks.
 * Gravity packing works as intended (no gaps in columns post-pack in generated outputs), but expected outputs appear to have gaps in some columns (e.g., train1 col4 has non-zeros at rows 2-5 and 8, with 0s at 6-7 and 9-11), suggesting either partial falling (only above removed cells) instead of full repack, or multiple steps, or that 0s don't allow passing through.
 * Removal logic is broken: only targets component from fixed (0,0) if non-zero there, leading to no removal or wrong group in all cases; e.g., train1 generated packs everything to bottom with intact large 2-group at bottom and 9 at bottom-left, but expected isolates 9 at top-left, connects 1's horizontally/vertically, and leaves scattered groups like 5's and 3's with apparent gaps.
 * Train1: Generated fully packs to bottom (e.g., 9 at row11 col0, 4's stacked at row8-11 col1, big 2's at row11 col2-9), but expected has 9 isolated at row0 col0, 4's at row8-11 col1 (correct pack for that column), but gaps in col2 (6's at row5-7, 2 at row8, 0s below) and col4 (5's at row2-4, 3 at row5, 2 at row8, 0s elsewhere)—different because wrong group removed, no gaps in generated.
 * Train2: Generated packs to bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, 6's stacked at row9-11 col1, 9's at row8-10 col2), but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 6's at row9-11 col1 and scattered 0s/gaps in col2 (9 at row6-8, 5 at row9, 0 at row10, etc.)—mismatch in isolated 4 position and gaps; unknown why 5's connect horizontally in row5 but not packed fully.
 * Train3: Similar to train2, generated packs to bottom (6 at row11 col0), expected has 6 at row0 col0, with gaps like 0s interrupting 9's and 5's in lower rows—wrong starting cell for component finding leads to no/different removal.
 * Train4: Generated has 4 at row11 col0, packs big 2's to row11, but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 1's connected but isolated 5's vertical with gaps below—no removal of 1's group in generated, but expected shows partial connections and bottom-packed 2's/7's without the upper clutter.
 * Train5: Generated has 7 at row11 col0, packs to bottom, but expected has 7 at row0 col0, with 5's and 1's scattered low with gaps (e.g., col4 has 5 at row6-8, but 0s below)—mismatch in single 7 position and failure to connect/remove specific groups like 1's.
 * The find_top_left_component function is broken for cases where (0,0) is 0 (skips removal entirely) or when the target group isn't connected to (0,0); not helpful as-is, modify to find the correct starting cell (e.g., bottom-left or largest group).
 * deepcopy is helpful for non-mutating the input.
 * Overall, attempt misunderstands which group to remove (likely not top-left), leading to incorrect configurations; gravity is applied but on wrong post-removal grid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed pattern as training examples: full packing to bottom with no gaps (e.g., 7 at row11 col0, 3's stacked at row9-11 col1, 1's at row11 col2-4, 2's at row11 col6-9, 9's at row10-11 col10), suggesting a removal (possibly of a top group including 4's and others) but wrong one, since training shows similar bottom-packed results are incorrect.
 * It leaves potential groups intact (e.g., vertical 3's in col4 rows4-6? Wait, row4 col4=3, row5=3, row6=3, row7=3? row7 col4=3 yes, 4 connected 3's not removed; horizontal 7's in row7 col7,10? scattered), and isolates pieces like single 6 at row8 col2, but expected likely wants a single at top-left (perhaps the 7) and specific connections/gaps as in training.
 * Does not match likely correct output, which should remove a key group (e.g., the 1's at bottom row11 col2-4 connected to row10 col3-4? or 2's at row11 col6-9), then gravity with possible apparent gaps if partial falling, resulting in something like [7,0,0...] at top and reconnected pieces lower without full bottom-packing of everything.
 * To handle test, update to find/remove the connected group starting from bottom-left cell (row11 col0=7), as patterns suggest bottom-left value ends up isolated at top-left after correct removal + gravity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a SameGame-style puzzle where the goal is to simulate a single "move" on a grid of colored blocks (represented by numbers): identify and remove one connected group of 3 or more identical colors that includes the top-left non-zero cell, then apply gravity to make remaining blocks fall down into empty spaces (packing each column from the bottom). The program processes only one such removal and packing step per input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are 4-way (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * The group to remove must be exactly the connected component containing the top-left cell (position [0][0], assuming it's non-zero); do not remove other disconnected groups of the same color, even if they are also size >=3—this is a key subtlety, as the current program removes all large groups of the top-left color, leading to over-removal.
 * Removal only happens if the connected group size is >=3; if <3, no removal or packing occurs (grid unchanged).
 * After removal, empty spaces (0s) are filled by shifting blocks down in each column independently—no horizontal movement or sliding between columns.
 * The top-left cell determines the color to target, but only its specific connected component is considered; other colors or groups are ignored in this step.
 * Grids are variable size but rectangular (e.g., 12x12 in examples); boundaries must be respected in neighbor checks.
 * Subtlety: After packing, new groups may form, but the program only simulates one removal and one packing—no cascading removals in a single step.
 * If the top-left is already 0, likely no action (but examples suggest inputs have non-zero there).
 * Outputs must match exactly, including positions of remaining blocks after packing; minor shifts (e.g., wrong column packing) cause mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: Packing starts from the bottom of each column, collecting non-zeros and placing them at the bottom, leaving 0s at the top—reversing this (e.g., packing from top) would fail.
 * In examples, removals create "islands" that pack differently; e.g., isolated blocks stay in their columns but shift down.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful and mostly correct, with minor tweaks needed (e.g., to target only the top-left component):
```python
def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
```python
def find_component(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, target_color: int, visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    stack = [(r, c)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != target_color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, len(g), len(g[0])):
            stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Note: This uses DFS via stack; it's correct for finding one component but should be called only once for the top-left cell, not iterated over the whole grid.)
```python
def pack_column_from_bottom(g: List[List[int]], c: int):
    rows = len(g)
    non_zeros = [g[r][c] for r in range(rows) if g[r][c] != 0]
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < rows - len(non_zeros):
            g[r][c] = 0
        else:
            g[r][c] = non_zeros[r - (rows - len(non_zeros))]
```
```python
def apply_packing_gravity(g: List[List[int]]):
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```
(The overall program structure is helpful: deepcopy input, get color from [0][0], conditionally remove and pack.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `remove_large_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> bool`: Broken for this puzzle—it iterates over the entire grid and removes ALL connected components of the target color that are >=3, instead of only the one containing [0][0]. This causes over-removal (e.g., multiple groups cleared when only one should be). Do not use as-is; modify to call `find_component` only on (0,0) and remove if len >=3.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt provided; it succeeded on Training example 1 (likely because the top-left color had only one large group, so removing all large groups of that color coincidentally matched removing just the top-left one).
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output cleared far too many cells (e.g., entire columns to 0s at top, with scattered remnants like 2s and 8s not packed correctly), resulting in a mostly empty grid; expected keeps more structure (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 9s and 5s packed in columns 2-3, 2s in column 5, 7s and 3s lower down)—difference is over-removal of multiple 5/7/3/2/8/9 groups of the top-left color, instead of just one group.
 * Failed on Training example 3: Generated has excessive clearing (e.g., many 0s at top, 2s partially removed and poorly packed, 4s/5s/9s scattered); expected preserves more (e.g., 6 at bottom-left, 8s packed in column 9, 5s/2s/7s/3s/4s in specific lower positions)—again, over-removal of multiple groups of the same color (likely top-left is 6 or similar), leaving wrong packing (e.g., 5s not grouped as in expected).
 * Failed on Training example 4: Generated packs incorrectly after removal (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/7 groups shifted wrong, with 0s not fully at top and blocks like 2s/7s not falling fully); expected has cleaner packing (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 5s/1s stacked in column 4, 3s/6s/5s/7s lower with 0s above)—issue is removing too much (possibly multiple 2/7 groups) and flawed packing (e.g., 1s not consolidated).
 * Failed on Training example 5: Similar to 4, generated has wrong shifts (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/4/7 groups not packed from bottom correctly, 0s misplaced); expected isolates 7 at bottom-left, packs 5s/1s higher with 0s below them incorrectly in generated—over-removal (multiple 2/4 groups) and packing bug (non-zeros not collected properly, leading to mid-column 0s).
 * Across attempts (inferred from pattern), the core issue is treating the move as "remove all large groups of top-left color" instead of "remove only the connected group containing top-left cell"; this works coincidentally for simple cases (train 1) but fails when multiple disconnected groups exist.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level analysis attempted, but not needed—direct component finding suffices.
 * Copy.deepcopy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Visited set prevents re-processing but is underused (iterates whole grid unnecessarily).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows partial removal and packing (e.g., 4s/3s/6s/5s/1s/2s/9s/7 shifted down, but with excessive 0s at top and incomplete consolidation—e.g., 1s/2s/5s not fully packed in columns 6-9, 9s isolated in column 10), suggesting over-removal of multiple groups (likely of color 7 or 3 from bottom-left/top). This mismatches the expected behavior, which should only remove the specific connected group including [0][0] (probably a small 7 or similar at bottom, but wait—grids are printed top-to-bottom, so [0][0] is top-left, likely a high number or 0? Input not shown, but output has 0s at top post-pack, implying removal affected upper areas wrong). To fix, mentally simulating: Assume input has top-left as, say, 7; only remove its connected >=3 group (e.g., the 1s/2s chain at bottom), then pack—expected would have 7 isolated at bottom-left, 3s/4s/6s/5s/8?/9 falling in their columns without clearing unrelated 5s/2s. The output clears too much (e.g., 8s gone, 5s scattered), confirming the multi-group removal bug; it does not make sense as a single-move simulation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a match-3 style puzzle game simulation where groups of 3 or more orthogonally connected cells (4-way adjacency: up, down, left, right) with the same value (color) are identified and removed in a single step, after which the remaining cells in each column fall down due to gravity and pack tightly from the bottom, leaving empty (0) spaces at the top. The program seems intended to process one such step starting from the top-left cell's color, but it includes flawed logic for handling cases where the initial component is too small, leading to incorrect removals and packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are strictly 4-way (no diagonals), and components must be exactly the same value to count as connected; isolated or smaller groups (<3 cells) are not removed.
 * Removal happens only for components of size >=3; the program searches for such components of the initial top-left color (C) if the starting one is too small, but this leads to over-removal or incorrect targeting in some cases.
 * After removal, gravity applies per column independently: non-zero cells slide down to the bottom, filling from row len-1 upward, with zeros pushed to the top; this must preserve the exact order of surviving cells in each column.
 * Subtle issue: The program modifies the grid in-place but has a hacky restoration step (if initial component <3, reset h[0][0] to C and set h[-1][0] to 0), which incorrectly reinserts or clears cells unrelated to the puzzle rules, causing mismatches like extra zeros or misplaced values.
 * Empty grid or all-zero top-left (C=0) should return unchanged; deep copy is used to avoid mutating input.
 * Puzzle likely assumes fixed 12x12 grid size based on outputs, but rows/cols are dynamic; no horizontal shifting or wrapping.
 * Multiple components of the same color may exist, but only those >=3 are removed—program attempts to find them but visits incorrectly, potentially missing or double-counting.
 * After packing, no further matches are resolved in this step; it's a single removal + gravity operation.
 * Expected outputs show specific patterns like horizontal lines of 1's or 5's forming after packing, vertical stacks preserving order, and isolated cells dropping correctly without merging different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Packing must collect non-zeros in their original top-to-bottom order and place them at the bottom; reversing or shuffling breaks this (e.g., in Train 1, generated has duplicated rows like [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] twice, indicating failed packing).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from copy import deepcopy

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```

```python
def find_connected_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not g or g[start_r][start_c] == 0:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    color = g[start_r][start_c]
    visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(start_r, start_c)]
    component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
            if (nr, nc) not in visited and g[nr][nc] == color:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```

```python
def remove_component_cells(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    for r, c in component:
        g[r][c] = 0
```

```python
def pack_column_from_bottom(g: List[List[int]], col: int) -> None:
    rows = len(g)
    non_zeros = [g[r][col] for r in range(rows) if g[r][col] != 0]
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < rows - len(non_zeros):
            g[r][col] = 0
        else:
            g[r][col] = non_zeros[r - (rows - len(non_zeros))]
```

```python
def apply_gravity_packing(g: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```
These functions correctly handle neighbor finding, DFS-based component extraction (using stack for iterative search), in-place zeroing, and per-column gravity packing (preserves order by collecting non-zeros top-to-bottom and placing at bottom).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a deep copy and correctly identifies the initial color C from top-left, but fails to remove only valid (>=3) components of that color without side effects.
 * Component finding works for isolated groups (e.g., stack-based DFS avoids recursion issues), but the main logic over-searches: if initial component <3, it scans the entire grid for other C-components >=3 and removes them, which succeeds in some vertical drops but causes incorrect packing in others (e.g., duplicates rows or fails to drop properly).
 * Packing functions are helpful and mostly correct, but applied after flawed removal, leading to zeros not fully propagating to top (e.g., in Train 1 generated, row 7 has [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] which should have dropped further to match expected horizontal 1's and 5's).
 * The restoration hack (if len(component)<3, set h[0][0]=C and h[-1][0]=0) is broken and unhelpful: it reinserts C incorrectly (e.g., in Train 1, places 9 at top but messes bottom-left), causing mismatches like extra 9's or cleared cells unrelated to rules—remove this entirely.
 * Train 1: Generated has incorrect packing (e.g., duplicated [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] rows, 1's not horizontally connected/dropped as in expected [0,0,0,0,5,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]), and bottom row [0,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,0] misses expected vertical 7's stacking; differs from expected by failing to remove a >=3 group of 1's or 5's properly.
 * Train 2: Generated packs some 2's and 5's but leaves gaps (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] instead of expected merged 5's), and bottom [0,6,5,5,0,1,7,7,7,7,3,0] has extra 5's not dropped; differs by not removing a horizontal 7's or vertical 5's group.
 * Train 3: Generated drops 2's but fails to connect 5's horizontally (row 4 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,2,5,5,5,8,0,0]), and 4's/3's not packed correctly; differs by missing removal of 4's group and incorrect 7's/3's stacking.
 * Train 4: Similar to Train 1, generated has undropped 1's/5's (row 7 [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] vs expected row 5 equivalent), and 3's not horizontally removed/packed; bottom row correct but mid-grid gaps persist.
 * Train 5: Generated clears too much (e.g., row 8 [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,0,0,0] misses expected 1's connection), and packs 2's/3's incorrectly without horizontal 1's forming; differs by not removing scattered 1's or 5's properly, leading to partial drops.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of components and gravity but fails due to flawed main logic (over-removal + hack); no extraction of all objects attempted, but component finder could be extended to scan all >=3 groups regardless of starting color (subtle: puzzle may remove all matching groups in one step, not just of C).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows partial drops (e.g., row 4 [0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] with isolated 4/3 not packed down fully, row 8 [0,0,6,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0] with 5's not connected horizontally as likely expected, bottom row [0,3,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,9,0] suggesting a 1's group and 2's group were removed but 5/9 not handled right).
 * Compared to puzzle rules, it seems to have removed some >=3 groups (e.g., possible 1's horizontal and 2's horizontal at bottom), but packing is incomplete—e.g., column 2 has 4's stacked mid-grid instead of bottom, column 10 has 9's not dropping alone; expected likely has tighter bottom-packing like vertical 3's/5's/9's and horizontal connections post-drop (e.g., 5's merging in col 6-7).
 * Differs from sensible output by leaving mid-grid gaps (e.g., row 9 [0,3,6,3,1,0,2,5,0,0,9,0] has scattered values that should drop per column), and top 7 unchanged but possibly irrelevant; unknown why 8's in col 6 didn't drop fully or if a 5's group was missed—output looks like partial simulation without full grid scan for all removable components.
 * To handle test, program needs to find/remove ALL >=3 components of ANY color (not just C), then pack; current version ties to top-left, causing misses.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs (1-5), below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** between components or properties. These are limited to patterns that hold **in every train example** (including cases with no change, like train 1). I focused only on elements with clear, direct effects or dependencies (e.g., one property influencing another's presence or state). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., components that never interact) are excluded. Inconsistent or sporadic patterns (e.g., variable downward shifts in position, which occur but vary by example without a clear uniform trigger across all) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided—only pairwise connections.

Components are defined by their key properties: **color** (categorical identifier), **bbox** (position and extent: [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y]), **pixels** (size indicator), and **holes** (always 0, no variation or interaction observed).

#### 1. **Top-Left 1x1 Component's Color → Removal of Matching-Color Components**
   - **Description**: The color of the isolated 1x1 component (always at bbox=[0,0,0,0], pixels=1) directly determines the fate of all other components with the exact same color. All matching-color components (excluding the top-left itself) are completely removed/absent in the output. No partial removal, color change, or relocation occurs for them.
   - **Affected Properties**: Presence of components (removed if color matches); no effect on bbox, pixels, or holes of non-matching components.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Top-left Light Blue; no other Light Blue components → 0 removals (consistent, no action needed).
     - Train 2: Top-left Yellow; other Yellow components (mid-horizontal at [3,6,5,6] pixels=3; bottom-right vertical at [10,9,10,11] pixels=3) → both removed.
     - Train 3: Top-left Pink; other Pink component (bottom-left vertical at [1,9,1,11] pixels=3) → removed.
     - Train 4: Top-left Yellow; other Yellow component (bottom-left vertical at [1,8,1,11] pixels=4) → removed.
     - Train 5: Top-left Dark Red; other Dark Red components (mid-right vertical at [9,5,9,7] pixels=3; bottom-right vertical at [10,8,10,11] pixels=4) → both removed.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color → presence (unidirectional effect; top-left color acts as a "filter" for removal).
   - **Notes**: This is the only transformation observed in **every** example. Total pixels in output are reduced by the exact sum of removed components' pixels (no compensation or redistribution observed consistently). No effect if no matches exist.

#### 2. **Top-Left 1x1 Component → Its Own Stability (No Interaction with Others)**
   - **Description**: The top-left 1x1 component (bbox=[0,0,0,0], pixels=1) remains completely unchanged, regardless of other components or transformations. Its color, position, and size are isolated and unaffected by any other elements.
   - **Affected Properties**: Its own bbox, pixels, color, and presence (fixed).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**: Identical input/output for this component in every pair (e.g., Light Blue in train 1; Yellow in trains 2/4; Pink in train 3; Dark Red in train 5).
   - **Interaction Type**: Self-contained stability (no observed effect on/from other components; it does not influence non-removal transformations like position shifts).
   - **Notes**: While isolated, this is consistently "interconnected" to the removal rule above (its color affects others, but nothing affects it). It never integrates or moves, even when other components shift.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Interactions
- **Position (bbox) Changes in Remaining Components**: Many non-removed components exhibit bbox shifts (often downward in min_y/max_y, e.g., +2 to +5 units in trains 2-5), but the trigger, amount, and direction vary (e.g., uniform +3 in train 4 vs. mixed +2/+3 in train 2 vs. 0 in train 1). No single property (e.g., adjacency to removed components, color, or pixels) consistently explains the transformation across all examples. Some cases extend bbox height or alter shape (e.g., Red pixels 4→5 in train 2), but this is not uniform.
- **Merging of Same-Color Components**: Observed in train 4 (two Dark Red components combine post-shift: pixels 3+4=7, bbox union [9,8,10,11]), but absent in other trains (no opportunity or no occurrence in trains 1-3/5). Not consistent across every example, so not listed as a core interaction—possibly dependent on post-removal position proximity (unknown).
- **Pixels Changes in Non-Merged Components**: Total pixels decrease by removed amounts (consistent with rule 1), but isolated increases (e.g., Red pixels +1 in train 2) occur sporadically without a clear trigger (e.g., no consistent link to adjacent removals or colors).
- **Color → Color Effects**: No color changes or new colors created in any output. Colors are preserved for non-removed components, but no further interactions (e.g., no blending or propagation) observed consistently.
- **Holes**: Always 0 in input/output; no interaction or change.
- **Other Position → Position Effects**: Adjacency or overlap in input does not consistently predict output positions (e.g., some adjacent groups shift together in train 4, but split/vary in train 2). Unknown trigger.

No forced connections (e.g., semantic shapes or unobservable properties like "edges/holes affecting movement") were inferred, as they are not evident from the provided bbox/pixels/color data. Only the removal rule qualifies as obvious, direct, and universal across all trains. Test inputs were not analyzed for patterns, as the task focuses on train consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

[2025-09-30 19:47:45] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle simulates a single step of a falling-block or match-3 game on a 12x12 grid, where connected groups (4-way adjacency) of 3 or more cells of the same color as the top-left cell (0,0) are removed, except for the group containing (0,0) itself to preserve an isolated or special top-left piece; remaining cells then fall downward under gravity, with a special rule for column 0 that fixes row 0 in place while packing rows 1-11 from the bottom, and standard bottom-packing for other columns. The goal is to produce a transformed grid after exactly one removal and gravity application, without chaining multiple removals or altering non-target colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and only groups of size >=3 of the exact color at (0,0) are targeted for removal—other colors and smaller groups (<3) of the target color are untouched.
 * The top-left cell (0,0) and its entire connected component must be preserved, even if large, to keep it "isolated" or fixed at the top; scanning must mark this component first to skip it during removal.
 * Gravity packing is column-wise and order-preserving (top-to-bottom order of non-zeros maintained as they fall to the bottom); for column 0, row 0 stays fixed regardless of its value, and only rows 1-11 are packed (non-zeros shift to rows 11 downward, zeros fill from row 1 up), which can leave gaps or isolate pieces differently than full-column packing.
 * No repeated removal steps—only one pass of identifying/removing qualifying groups, then one gravity application; the puzzle does not chain matches.
 * Grid is always 12x12, with 0 representing empty; input has non-zeros only in lower rows typically, but output can have empties at top.
 * Subtle: Packing in column 0 can cause "floating" non-zeros in rows 1+ if fewer than 11, and the fixed row 0 might be 0 or non-zero, affecting visual isolation; other columns pack fully, potentially aligning pieces horizontally for future matches (but not relevant here).
 * Easy to miss: Removal only affects the top-left color—other large groups of different colors stay; also, if (0,0) is 0, no removals occur.
 * Components must be found via DFS or BFS without revisiting; deep copy input to avoid mutating original.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show partial packings (e.g., gaps in columns) and preserved small groups or singles of the target color, suggesting the preservation rule is key but incompletely applied.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the top-left color and attempts to preserve its component while removing other >=3 groups of that color, using solid DFS for components and special packing for column 0, showing understanding of isolation and gravity rules.
 * What worked: Component detection and removal logic skips the (0,0) group properly; special packing for col 0 fixes row 0 and packs below correctly in isolation; deep copy prevents input mutation; handles empty grids or 0 at (0,0).
 * What didn't work: Fails to match any training expected outputs, likely because removal is too aggressive or incomplete—e.g., in Train 1, generated packs everything too low without gaps (e.g., row 2 all 0s, but expected has 1s in row 2 cols 6-9 and 5s/1s lower with gaps); in Train 2, generated leaves 5s and 7s unpacked incorrectly (e.g., row 10 has 5 at col 3 but expected has it lower); similar over-packing or missed preservations in Train 3 (e.g., 4s in row 8 col 3-5 expected connected but generated scatters them) and Train 4/5 (e.g., 1s and 5s not gapped as in expected, 2s row packed fully but expected has higher empties).
 * Subtleties missed: Packing order may not preserve relative positions across rows correctly after removal (e.g., expected shows staggered falls creating gaps); possibly needs to remove only after scanning all, or handle isolated small groups (<3) of target color that fall differently; unknown why generated Train 1 has duplicate rows 8-9 (4,6,0,5,3 etc.) but expected spreads 6s/3s with zeros.
 * Function `remove_other_large_groups_of_color` is helpful but buggy— it marks (0,0) component correctly but may not scan exhaustively if components overlap or if (0,0) color is absent; still useful with fixes.
 * `apply_gravity_packing_special` composes packing well but applies too uniformly, ignoring that removals create uneven heights per column that expected preserves (e.g., not all columns fall fully).
 * Overall, attempt grasps core removal/packing but mismatches on gap creation and partial falls, suggesting puzzle may involve no removal if (0,0) component is the only large one, or different adjacency (but 4-way seems right).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-packs columns with no gaps (e.g., col 2 has 4s packed to rows 4-7 but likely should have gaps like in Train 1 expected; col 4 has 3s in rows 4-11 but expected patterns suggest staggered 3s/1s with zeros above them partially).
 * Missing preservations: Target color is 7 at (0,0), but generated keeps everything low without removing any 7 groups (there are no large 7s visible in input anyway), yet packs col 0 rows 1+ fully (e.g., 3s at bottom), while expected would likely isolate small 7s or other pieces higher with gaps (based on Train patterns, e.g., 1s/2s/5s should have voids like in Train 2/3).
 * Does not match puzzle logic: Input has scattered 3s/1s/5s/2s that might form small groups post-fall, but generated mashes 1s/5s/2s at bottom row 11 without the expected spreading (e.g., row 11 has 1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,9 but should have more zeros and higher placements per Train 4/5); col 0 packs 3s too low, ignoring potential fixed row 0 isolation.
 * Unclear why, but generated ignores potential small target-color groups (no 7s elsewhere), leading to uniform fall that doesn't create the "partial stack" seen in expecteds (e.g., 8s in col 6 stay mid-grid in input but pack down fully).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 19:48:43] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 5 train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that hold across **every** example (either directly occurring or vacuously true where applicable, e.g., no counterexamples). I ignored isolated elements (e.g., individual shapes without observed effects on others), inconsistent changes (e.g., variable shift amounts or growths not seen in all pairs), and irrelevant details (e.g., absolute positions without relational effects, or semantic shapes not tied to interactions). No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation rules are inferred or provided. Where a connection cannot be fully explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Top monomino (1-pixel component at bbox=[0,0,0,0]) ↔ Color property of other components**: The top monomino's color consistently interacts with any other components sharing that exact color, causing their removal (disappearance from output, with pixels not transferred elsewhere). This holds in every train pair: observed directly in train 2 (additional Yellow components removed), train 3 (additional Pink removed), train 4 (additional Yellow removed), and train 5 (additional Dark Red components removed); in train 1, no matching components exist, so no removal occurs (consistent, no conflict). The top monomino itself remains unaffected and fixed.

- **Top monomino color (specifically Light Blue) ↔ Positional properties (bbox y-coordinates) of all other components**: When the top monomino is Light Blue, it consistently prevents any positional changes (no shifts in bbox x or y for any other components). This is observed in train 1 (all other components unchanged). In other trains (2-5), where top is not Light Blue, other components do shift (downward in y), but this conditional effect ties back to the top color interaction consistently across all pairs (no shifts when Light Blue, shifts when not).

- **Holes property (all=0) ↔ All components**: No component has holes in any input or output across all trains, so the holes=0 property has no observed interactions or changes with any other elements (static and irrelevant to transformations).

Unknowns:
- Specific mechanisms for bbox shifts (e.g., exact y-increments or triggers beyond the top color condition) are inconsistent in amount and occurrence (e.g., +2 in some parts of train 3, +3 in train 4), so no reliable connection to other properties (e.g., position-to-position or shape-to-movement) can be identified across every pair.
- Pixel count changes for non-removed components (e.g., occasional growth like Red from 4 to 5 in train 2) lack a consistent tie to any other property or component across all pairs; called unknown rather than forced.
- Merging (e.g., same-color components combining pixels/bbox in train 4) is not observed in every pair (absent in train 1, 2, 3, 5), so no consistent interaction identified.

[2025-09-30 19:50:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored blocks, where connected groups (likely 4-way adjacent) of 3 or more identical numbers are removed, followed by gravity that causes the remaining blocks to fall down in their columns while preserving relative order, filling from the bottom with empty spaces (0s) at the top. The goal of the program is to simulate one step of this process on the input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected groups are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * Only groups of size 3 or more are removed; smaller groups or singles stay.
 * After removal, gravity is applied per column: collect all remaining non-zero values in their original top-to-bottom order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column (row index len-1 downward), with 0s filling the top rows—no gaps allowed in any column after packing.
 * The program always applies gravity, even if no removal occurs, which could incorrectly pack grids that already have no gaps.
 * Row 0 is the top row, row len-1 is the bottom; empty space at top after gravity.
 * Likely only one specific group is removed per step (not all groups), but the current logic picks the wrong one (connected to (0,0) only if non-zero); possible rules include removing the largest group, the group touching the bottom-left, or the group with the topmost/leftmost cell.
 * Subtlety: If top-left (0,0) is 0, no removal happens, but gravity still runs, potentially altering stable grids incorrectly.
 * Repeated removal/gravity cycles may be needed if new groups form after falling, but expected outputs still show remaining groups of 3+, suggesting single removal + single gravity only.
 * Inputs likely have no initial gaps (full or near-full grids), so incorrect removal leads to wrong post-gravity configurations.
 * Expected outputs show configurations with what appear to be gaps in some columns (e.g., non-zeros separated by 0s in the same column), which contradicts full per-column packing—possibly indicating that gravity only fills specific holes from removals (not full repack), or that multiple selective removals occur without full repacking each time, or even that 0s are not treated as empty spaces for falling.
 * Different training examples have varying bottom-left values (e.g., 9 in train1, 4 in train4, 7 in train5), which appear in generated bottoms but in expected "top-left singles," suggesting the removal logic misses the key group containing that cell.
 * Unclear if removal happens before or after any initial gravity, or if the grid wraps/ has special rules for edges.

            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```

    offset = rows - len(non_zeros)
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < offset:
            g[r][col] = 0
        else:
            g[r][col] = non_zeros[r - offset]
```

    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements 4-way connected component finding via DFS/stack, removal by setting to 0, and per-column gravity packing to the bottom preserving order—these are solid building blocks.
 * Gravity packing works as intended (no gaps in columns post-pack in generated outputs), but expected outputs appear to have gaps in some columns (e.g., train1 col4 has non-zeros at rows 2-5 and 8, with 0s at 6-7 and 9-11), suggesting either partial falling (only above removed cells) instead of full repack, or multiple steps, or that 0s don't allow passing through.
 * Removal logic is broken: only targets component from fixed (0,0) if non-zero there, leading to no removal or wrong group in all cases; e.g., train1 generated packs everything to bottom with intact large 2-group at bottom and 9 at bottom-left, but expected isolates 9 at top-left, connects 1's horizontally/vertically, and leaves scattered groups like 5's and 3's with apparent gaps.
 * Train1: Generated fully packs to bottom (e.g., 9 at row11 col0, 4's stacked at row8-11 col1, big 2's at row11 col2-9), but expected has 9 isolated at row0 col0, 4's at row8-11 col1 (correct pack for that column), but gaps in col2 (6's at row5-7, 2 at row8, 0s below) and col4 (5's at row2-4, 3 at row5, 2 at row8, 0s elsewhere)—different because wrong group removed, no gaps in generated.
 * Train2: Generated packs to bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, 6's stacked at row9-11 col1, 9's at row8-10 col2), but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 6's at row9-11 col1 and scattered 0s/gaps in col2 (9 at row6-8, 5 at row9, 0 at row10, etc.)—mismatch in isolated 4 position and gaps; unknown why 5's connect horizontally in row5 but not packed fully.
 * Train3: Similar to train2, generated packs to bottom (6 at row11 col0), expected has 6 at row0 col0, with gaps like 0s interrupting 9's and 5's in lower rows—wrong starting cell for component finding leads to no/different removal.
 * Train4: Generated has 4 at row11 col0, packs big 2's to row11, but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 1's connected but isolated 5's vertical with gaps below—no removal of 1's group in generated, but expected shows partial connections and bottom-packed 2's/7's without the upper clutter.
 * Train5: Generated has 7 at row11 col0, packs to bottom, but expected has 7 at row0 col0, with 5's and 1's scattered low with gaps (e.g., col4 has 5 at row6-8, but 0s below)—mismatch in single 7 position and failure to connect/remove specific groups like 1's.
 * The find_top_left_component function is broken for cases where (0,0) is 0 (skips removal entirely) or when the target group isn't connected to (0,0); not helpful as-is, modify to find the correct starting cell (e.g., bottom-left or largest group).
 * deepcopy is helpful for non-mutating the input.
 * Overall, attempt misunderstands which group to remove (likely not top-left), leading to incorrect configurations; gravity is applied but on wrong post-removal grid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed pattern as training examples: full packing to bottom with no gaps (e.g., 7 at row11 col0, 3's stacked at row9-11 col1, 1's at row11 col2-4, 2's at row11 col6-9, 9's at row10-11 col10), suggesting a removal (possibly of a top group including 4's and others) but wrong one, since training shows similar bottom-packed results are incorrect.
 * It leaves potential groups intact (e.g., vertical 3's in col4 rows4-6? Wait, row4 col4=3, row5=3, row6=3, row7=3? row7 col4=3 yes, 4 connected 3's not removed; horizontal 7's in row7 col7,10? scattered), and isolates pieces like single 6 at row8 col2, but expected likely wants a single at top-left (perhaps the 7) and specific connections/gaps as in training.
 * Does not match likely correct output, which should remove a key group (e.g., the 1's at bottom row11 col2-4 connected to row10 col3-4? or 2's at row11 col6-9), then gravity with possible apparent gaps if partial falling, resulting in something like [7,0,0...] at top and reconnected pieces lower without full bottom-packing of everything.
 * To handle test, update to find/remove the connected group starting from bottom-left cell (row11 col0=7), as patterns suggest bottom-left value ends up isolated at top-left after correct removal + gravity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a SameGame-style puzzle where the goal is to simulate a single "move" on a grid of colored blocks (represented by numbers): identify and remove one connected group of 3 or more identical colors that includes the top-left non-zero cell, then apply gravity to make remaining blocks fall down into empty spaces (packing each column from the bottom). The program processes only one such removal and packing step per input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are 4-way (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * The group to remove must be exactly the connected component containing the top-left cell (position [0][0], assuming it's non-zero); do not remove other disconnected groups of the same color, even if they are also size >=3—this is a key subtlety, as the current program removes all large groups of the top-left color, leading to over-removal.
 * Removal only happens if the connected group size is >=3; if <3, no removal or packing occurs (grid unchanged).
 * After removal, empty spaces (0s) are filled by shifting blocks down in each column independently—no horizontal movement or sliding between columns.
 * The top-left cell determines the color to target, but only its specific connected component is considered; other colors or groups are ignored in this step.
 * Grids are variable size but rectangular (e.g., 12x12 in examples); boundaries must be respected in neighbor checks.
 * Subtlety: After packing, new groups may form, but the program only simulates one removal and one packing—no cascading removals in a single step.
 * If the top-left is already 0, likely no action (but examples suggest inputs have non-zero there).
 * Outputs must match exactly, including positions of remaining blocks after packing; minor shifts (e.g., wrong column packing) cause mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: Packing starts from the bottom of each column, collecting non-zeros and placing them at the bottom, leaving 0s at the top—reversing this (e.g., packing from top) would fail.
 * In examples, removals create "islands" that pack differently; e.g., isolated blocks stay in their columns but shift down.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful and mostly correct, with minor tweaks needed (e.g., to target only the top-left component):
```python
def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
```python
def find_component(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, target_color: int, visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    stack = [(r, c)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != target_color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, len(g), len(g[0])):
            stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Note: This uses DFS via stack; it's correct for finding one component but should be called only once for the top-left cell, not iterated over the whole grid.)
```python
def pack_column_from_bottom(g: List[List[int]], c: int):
    rows = len(g)
    non_zeros = [g[r][c] for r in range(rows) if g[r][c] != 0]
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < rows - len(non_zeros):
            g[r][c] = 0
        else:
            g[r][c] = non_zeros[r - (rows - len(non_zeros))]
```
```python
def apply_packing_gravity(g: List[List[int]]):
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```
(The overall program structure is helpful: deepcopy input, get color from [0][0], conditionally remove and pack.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `remove_large_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> bool`: Broken for this puzzle—it iterates over the entire grid and removes ALL connected components of the target color that are >=3, instead of only the one containing [0][0]. This causes over-removal (e.g., multiple groups cleared when only one should be). Do not use as-is; modify to call `find_component` only on (0,0) and remove if len >=3.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt provided; it succeeded on Training example 1 (likely because the top-left color had only one large group, so removing all large groups of that color coincidentally matched removing just the top-left one).
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output cleared far too many cells (e.g., entire columns to 0s at top, with scattered remnants like 2s and 8s not packed correctly), resulting in a mostly empty grid; expected keeps more structure (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 9s and 5s packed in columns 2-3, 2s in column 5, 7s and 3s lower down)—difference is over-removal of multiple 5/7/3/2/8/9 groups of the top-left color, instead of just one group.
 * Failed on Training example 3: Generated has excessive clearing (e.g., many 0s at top, 2s partially removed and poorly packed, 4s/5s/9s scattered); expected preserves more (e.g., 6 at bottom-left, 8s packed in column 9, 5s/2s/7s/3s/4s in specific lower positions)—again, over-removal of multiple groups of the same color (likely top-left is 6 or similar), leaving wrong packing (e.g., 5s not grouped as in expected).
 * Failed on Training example 4: Generated packs incorrectly after removal (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/7 groups shifted wrong, with 0s not fully at top and blocks like 2s/7s not falling fully); expected has cleaner packing (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 5s/1s stacked in column 4, 3s/6s/5s/7s lower with 0s above)—issue is removing too much (possibly multiple 2/7 groups) and flawed packing (e.g., 1s not consolidated).
 * Failed on Training example 5: Similar to 4, generated has wrong shifts (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/4/7 groups not packed from bottom correctly, 0s misplaced); expected isolates 7 at bottom-left, packs 5s/1s higher with 0s below them incorrectly in generated—over-removal (multiple 2/4 groups) and packing bug (non-zeros not collected properly, leading to mid-column 0s).
 * Across attempts (inferred from pattern), the core issue is treating the move as "remove all large groups of top-left color" instead of "remove only the connected group containing top-left cell"; this works coincidentally for simple cases (train 1) but fails when multiple disconnected groups exist.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level analysis attempted, but not needed—direct component finding suffices.
 * Copy.deepcopy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Visited set prevents re-processing but is underused (iterates whole grid unnecessarily).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows partial removal and packing (e.g., 4s/3s/6s/5s/1s/2s/9s/7 shifted down, but with excessive 0s at top and incomplete consolidation—e.g., 1s/2s/5s not fully packed in columns 6-9, 9s isolated in column 10), suggesting over-removal of multiple groups (likely of color 7 or 3 from bottom-left/top). This mismatches the expected behavior, which should only remove the specific connected group including [0][0] (probably a small 7 or similar at bottom, but wait—grids are printed top-to-bottom, so [0][0] is top-left, likely a high number or 0? Input not shown, but output has 0s at top post-pack, implying removal affected upper areas wrong). To fix, mentally simulating: Assume input has top-left as, say, 7; only remove its connected >=3 group (e.g., the 1s/2s chain at bottom), then pack—expected would have 7 isolated at bottom-left, 3s/4s/6s/5s/8?/9 falling in their columns without clearing unrelated 5s/2s. The output clears too much (e.g., 8s gone, 5s scattered), confirming the multi-group removal bug; it does not make sense as a single-move simulation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a match-3 style puzzle game simulation where groups of 3 or more orthogonally connected cells (4-way adjacency: up, down, left, right) with the same value (color) are identified and removed in a single step, after which the remaining cells in each column fall down due to gravity and pack tightly from the bottom, leaving empty (0) spaces at the top. The program seems intended to process one such step starting from the top-left cell's color, but it includes flawed logic for handling cases where the initial component is too small, leading to incorrect removals and packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are strictly 4-way (no diagonals), and components must be exactly the same value to count as connected; isolated or smaller groups (<3 cells) are not removed.
 * Removal happens only for components of size >=3; the program searches for such components of the initial top-left color (C) if the starting one is too small, but this leads to over-removal or incorrect targeting in some cases.
 * After removal, gravity applies per column independently: non-zero cells slide down to the bottom, filling from row len-1 upward, with zeros pushed to the top; this must preserve the exact order of surviving cells in each column.
 * Subtle issue: The program modifies the grid in-place but has a hacky restoration step (if initial component <3, reset h[0][0] to C and set h[-1][0] to 0), which incorrectly reinserts or clears cells unrelated to the puzzle rules, causing mismatches like extra zeros or misplaced values.
 * Empty grid or all-zero top-left (C=0) should return unchanged; deep copy is used to avoid mutating input.
 * Puzzle likely assumes fixed 12x12 grid size based on outputs, but rows/cols are dynamic; no horizontal shifting or wrapping.
 * Multiple components of the same color may exist, but only those >=3 are removed—program attempts to find them but visits incorrectly, potentially missing or double-counting.
 * After packing, no further matches are resolved in this step; it's a single removal + gravity operation.
 * Expected outputs show specific patterns like horizontal lines of 1's or 5's forming after packing, vertical stacks preserving order, and isolated cells dropping correctly without merging different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Packing must collect non-zeros in their original top-to-bottom order and place them at the bottom; reversing or shuffling breaks this (e.g., in Train 1, generated has duplicated rows like [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] twice, indicating failed packing).

These functions correctly handle neighbor finding, DFS-based component extraction (using stack for iterative search), in-place zeroing, and per-column gravity packing (preserves order by collecting non-zeros top-to-bottom and placing at bottom).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a deep copy and correctly identifies the initial color C from top-left, but fails to remove only valid (>=3) components of that color without side effects.
 * Component finding works for isolated groups (e.g., stack-based DFS avoids recursion issues), but the main logic over-searches: if initial component <3, it scans the entire grid for other C-components >=3 and removes them, which succeeds in some vertical drops but causes incorrect packing in others (e.g., duplicates rows or fails to drop properly).
 * Packing functions are helpful and mostly correct, but applied after flawed removal, leading to zeros not fully propagating to top (e.g., in Train 1 generated, row 7 has [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] which should have dropped further to match expected horizontal 1's and 5's).
 * The restoration hack (if len(component)<3, set h[0][0]=C and h[-1][0]=0) is broken and unhelpful: it reinserts C incorrectly (e.g., in Train 1, places 9 at top but messes bottom-left), causing mismatches like extra 9's or cleared cells unrelated to rules—remove this entirely.
 * Train 1: Generated has incorrect packing (e.g., duplicated [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] rows, 1's not horizontally connected/dropped as in expected [0,0,0,0,5,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]), and bottom row [0,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,0] misses expected vertical 7's stacking; differs from expected by failing to remove a >=3 group of 1's or 5's properly.
 * Train 2: Generated packs some 2's and 5's but leaves gaps (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] instead of expected merged 5's), and bottom [0,6,5,5,0,1,7,7,7,7,3,0] has extra 5's not dropped; differs by not removing a horizontal 7's or vertical 5's group.
 * Train 3: Generated drops 2's but fails to connect 5's horizontally (row 4 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,2,5,5,5,8,0,0]), and 4's/3's not packed correctly; differs by missing removal of 4's group and incorrect 7's/3's stacking.
 * Train 4: Similar to Train 1, generated has undropped 1's/5's (row 7 [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] vs expected row 5 equivalent), and 3's not horizontally removed/packed; bottom row correct but mid-grid gaps persist.
 * Train 5: Generated clears too much (e.g., row 8 [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,0,0,0] misses expected 1's connection), and packs 2's/3's incorrectly without horizontal 1's forming; differs by not removing scattered 1's or 5's properly, leading to partial drops.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of components and gravity but fails due to flawed main logic (over-removal + hack); no extraction of all objects attempted, but component finder could be extended to scan all >=3 groups regardless of starting color (subtle: puzzle may remove all matching groups in one step, not just of C).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows partial drops (e.g., row 4 [0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] with isolated 4/3 not packed down fully, row 8 [0,0,6,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0] with 5's not connected horizontally as likely expected, bottom row [0,3,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,9,0] suggesting a 1's group and 2's group were removed but 5/9 not handled right).
 * Compared to puzzle rules, it seems to have removed some >=3 groups (e.g., possible 1's horizontal and 2's horizontal at bottom), but packing is incomplete—e.g., column 2 has 4's stacked mid-grid instead of bottom, column 10 has 9's not dropping alone; expected likely has tighter bottom-packing like vertical 3's/5's/9's and horizontal connections post-drop (e.g., 5's merging in col 6-7).
 * Differs from sensible output by leaving mid-grid gaps (e.g., row 9 [0,3,6,3,1,0,2,5,0,0,9,0] has scattered values that should drop per column), and top 7 unchanged but possibly irrelevant; unknown why 8's in col 6 didn't drop fully or if a 5's group was missed—output looks like partial simulation without full grid scan for all removable components.
 * To handle test, program needs to find/remove ALL >=3 components of ANY color (not just C), then pack; current version ties to top-left, causing misses.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle simulates a single step of a falling-block or match-3 game on a 12x12 grid, where connected groups (4-way adjacency) of 3 or more cells of the same color as the top-left cell (0,0) are removed, except for the group containing (0,0) itself to preserve an isolated or special top-left piece; remaining cells then fall downward under gravity, with a special rule for column 0 that fixes row 0 in place while packing rows 1-11 from the bottom, and standard bottom-packing for other columns. The goal is to produce a transformed grid after exactly one removal and gravity application, without chaining multiple removals or altering non-target colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and only groups of size >=3 of the exact color at (0,0) are targeted for removal—other colors and smaller groups (<3) of the target color are untouched.
 * The top-left cell (0,0) and its entire connected component must be preserved, even if large, to keep it "isolated" or fixed at the top; scanning must mark this component first to skip it during removal.
 * Gravity packing is column-wise and order-preserving (top-to-bottom order of non-zeros maintained as they fall to the bottom); for column 0, row 0 stays fixed regardless of its value, and only rows 1-11 are packed (non-zeros shift to rows 11 downward, zeros fill from row 1 up), which can leave gaps or isolate pieces differently than full-column packing.
 * No repeated removal steps—only one pass of identifying/removing qualifying groups, then one gravity application; the puzzle does not chain matches.
 * Grid is always 12x12, with 0 representing empty; input has non-zeros only in lower rows typically, but output can have empties at top.
 * Subtle: Packing in column 0 can cause "floating" non-zeros in rows 1+ if fewer than 11, and the fixed row 0 might be 0 or non-zero, affecting visual isolation; other columns pack fully, potentially aligning pieces horizontally for future matches (but not relevant here).
 * Easy to miss: Removal only affects the top-left color—other large groups of different colors stay; also, if (0,0) is 0, no removals occur.
 * Components must be found via DFS or BFS without revisiting; deep copy input to avoid mutating original.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show partial packings (e.g., gaps in columns) and preserved small groups or singles of the target color, suggesting the preservation rule is key but incompletely applied.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the top-left color and attempts to preserve its component while removing other >=3 groups of that color, using solid DFS for components and special packing for column 0, showing understanding of isolation and gravity rules.
 * What worked: Component detection and removal logic skips the (0,0) group properly; special packing for col 0 fixes row 0 and packs below correctly in isolation; deep copy prevents input mutation; handles empty grids or 0 at (0,0).
 * What didn't work: Fails to match any training expected outputs, likely because removal is too aggressive or incomplete—e.g., in Train 1, generated packs everything too low without gaps (e.g., row 2 all 0s, but expected has 1s in row 2 cols 6-9 and 5s/1s lower with gaps); in Train 2, generated leaves 5s and 7s unpacked incorrectly (e.g., row 10 has 5 at col 3 but expected has it lower); similar over-packing or missed preservations in Train 3 (e.g., 4s in row 8 col 3-5 expected connected but generated scatters them) and Train 4/5 (e.g., 1s and 5s not gapped as in expected, 2s row packed fully but expected has higher empties).
 * Subtleties missed: Packing order may not preserve relative positions across rows correctly after removal (e.g., expected shows staggered falls creating gaps); possibly needs to remove only after scanning all, or handle isolated small groups (<3) of target color that fall differently; unknown why generated Train 1 has duplicate rows 8-9 (4,6,0,5,3 etc.) but expected spreads 6s/3s with zeros.
 * Function `remove_other_large_groups_of_color` is helpful but buggy— it marks (0,0) component correctly but may not scan exhaustively if components overlap or if (0,0) color is absent; still useful with fixes.
 * `apply_gravity_packing_special` composes packing well but applies too uniformly, ignoring that removals create uneven heights per column that expected preserves (e.g., not all columns fall fully).
 * Overall, attempt grasps core removal/packing but mismatches on gap creation and partial falls, suggesting puzzle may involve no removal if (0,0) component is the only large one, or different adjacency (but 4-way seems right).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-packs columns with no gaps (e.g., col 2 has 4s packed to rows 4-7 but likely should have gaps like in Train 1 expected; col 4 has 3s in rows 4-11 but expected patterns suggest staggered 3s/1s with zeros above them partially).
 * Missing preservations: Target color is 7 at (0,0), but generated keeps everything low without removing any 7 groups (there are no large 7s visible in input anyway), yet packs col 0 rows 1+ fully (e.g., 3s at bottom), while expected would likely isolate small 7s or other pieces higher with gaps (based on Train patterns, e.g., 1s/2s/5s should have voids like in Train 2/3).
 * Does not match puzzle logic: Input has scattered 3s/1s/5s/2s that might form small groups post-fall, but generated mashes 1s/5s/2s at bottom row 11 without the expected spreading (e.g., row 11 has 1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,9 but should have more zeros and higher placements per Train 4/5); col 0 packs 3s too low, ignoring potential fixed row 0 isolation.
 * Unclear why, but generated ignores potential small target-color groups (no 7s elsewhere), leading to uniform fall that doesn't create the "partial stack" seen in expecteds (e.g., 8s in col 6 stay mid-grid in input but pack down fully).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 5 train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that hold across **every** example (either directly occurring or vacuously true where applicable, e.g., no counterexamples). I ignored isolated elements (e.g., individual shapes without observed effects on others), inconsistent changes (e.g., variable shift amounts or growths not seen in all pairs), and irrelevant details (e.g., absolute positions without relational effects, or semantic shapes not tied to interactions). No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation rules are inferred or provided. Where a connection cannot be fully explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Top monomino (1-pixel component at bbox=[0,0,0,0]) ↔ Color property of other components**: The top monomino's color consistently interacts with any other components sharing that exact color, causing their removal (disappearance from output, with pixels not transferred elsewhere). This holds in every train pair: observed directly in train 2 (additional Yellow components removed), train 3 (additional Pink removed), train 4 (additional Yellow removed), and train 5 (additional Dark Red components removed); in train 1, no matching components exist, so no removal occurs (consistent, no conflict). The top monomino itself remains unaffected and fixed.

- **Top monomino color (specifically Light Blue) ↔ Positional properties (bbox y-coordinates) of all other components**: When the top monomino is Light Blue, it consistently prevents any positional changes (no shifts in bbox x or y for any other components). This is observed in train 1 (all other components unchanged). In other trains (2-5), where top is not Light Blue, other components do shift (downward in y), but this conditional effect ties back to the top color interaction consistently across all pairs (no shifts when Light Blue, shifts when not).

- **Holes property (all=0) ↔ All components**: No component has holes in any input or output across all trains, so the holes=0 property has no observed interactions or changes with any other elements (static and irrelevant to transformations).

Unknowns:
- Specific mechanisms for bbox shifts (e.g., exact y-increments or triggers beyond the top color condition) are inconsistent in amount and occurrence (e.g., +2 in some parts of train 3, +3 in train 4), so no reliable connection to other properties (e.g., position-to-position or shape-to-movement) can be identified across every pair.
- Pixel count changes for non-removed components (e.g., occasional growth like Red from 4 to 5 in train 2) lack a consistent tie to any other property or component across all pairs; called unknown rather than forced.
- Merging (e.g., same-color components combining pixels/bbox in train 4) is not observed in every pair (absent in train 1, 2, 3, 5), so no consistent interaction identified.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:04:40] Response:
**High level:** This is a block removal puzzle where the color (number) at the top-left cell (0,0) determines the target color C, and all connected components (4-way adjacent) of C with 3 or more blocks are removed, except the component containing the top-left cell itself, which always remains intact regardless of its size. Removals set cells to 0, but no gravity or packing is applied—blocks stay in their original positions, creating gaps where removals occur.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * Only components of the exact color C = grid[0][0] are eligible for removal; groups of other colors are never touched, even if >=3.
 * The component containing (0,0) is exempt from removal, even if it has >=3 blocks—this is a key subtlety, as it protects the "starting" group.
 * If grid[0][0] == 0 or the grid is empty, no changes occur.
 * Removals happen in a single pass: identify and remove all qualifying components without iteration (no chain reactions).
 * No gravity: after setting removed cells to 0, the grid retains all original positions of surviving blocks, leading to floating blocks and gaps (empties) in columns, which is easy to miss if assuming standard falling mechanics.
 * Components smaller than 3 (even of color C) are left untouched.
 * Use a visited set to avoid re-processing cells during component search.
 * The puzzle processes the entire grid, but prioritizes marking the top-left component first to exclude it.
 * Subtle: the removal only triggers if at least one qualifying component is found; otherwise, return the original grid unchanged.
 * Across attempts, failing to exclude the top-left component or applying gravity shifts blocks, mismatching expected outputs with gaps and floating elements.
 * Inputs seem to be 12x12 grids (based on outputs), with row 0 as top.

```

(Note: The pack_column_from_bottom and apply_gravity_packing functions from the attempt are broken/not helpful for this puzzle, as they incorrectly shift blocks to the bottom, creating no gaps and mismatching expected outputs with floating blocks; do not use them in future attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, likely because no qualifying components were removed (e.g., no other C groups >=3), so the grid was unchanged, and erroneous gravity had no visible effect.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated packs all surviving blocks to the bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, scattered blocks in rows 5-11 with no gaps), but expected leaves the top-left 4 at row0 col0, packs nothing (e.g., three 5's at row6 col6-8 stay in place, three 9's at row6-8 col2 stay, four 7's at row11 col6-9 stay, with gaps like row10 col2:0 and row11 col2:0 below a 5 at row9 col2).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated packs to bottom (e.g., 6 at row11? but print shows partial packing with blocks in rows 5-11), but expected has top-left 6 at row0 col0, no overall shift (e.g., three 5's at row4 col6-8 stay, three 8's at row2-4 col9 stay vertical with empties below, three 4's at row8 col3-5 stay, four 7's at row9 col6-9 stay, gaps like row10 col6:0 below 7 at row9 col6).
 * Training 4: Incorrect; generated fully packs to bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, all blocks squeezed into rows 8-11 with no gaps, like 6's and 3's consecutive in col2-3), but expected leaves 4 at row0 col0 floating, with gaps (e.g., 5 at row6-7 col4 above 3 at row8 col4 with row9-11 col4:0/2, 1's at row6-7 col8 above nothing, no shifting of 6-3-2 in col2).
 * Training 5: Incorrect; generated packs to bottom (e.g., 7 at row11 col0, blocks in rows 8-11 like 4's and 6's shifted down), but expected has 7 at row0 col0, gaps preserved (e.g., 5 at row6-8 col4 with nothing below until row11, 1's at row7 col8 isolated, 4-6-2 in col1 with no shift).
 * Overall, the component finding and visited logic worked well to identify and skip the top-left group while targeting other C groups >=3, but applying gravity universally shifted all columns down, eliminating gaps and moving surviving blocks (including non-C ones) to bottom rows, which never matches expected structures with position-preserved gaps and floating elements.
 * No evidence of needing to remove the top-left component or handle other colors, as expected outputs retain non-C groups intact in place.
 * deepcopy was helpful to avoid mutating the original grid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial-to-full packing towards the bottom (e.g., empty rows 0-3, 4's stacked at row4-7 col2 without gaps above but with empties below some like row8 col6:5,5 but row9 col6:2 with no shift, 7 at row11 col0 dropped down, 3's and 6's in col1-2 rows9-11 packed consecutively), which indicates gravity was applied per column, creating no gaps in surviving stacks.
 * Based on training patterns, the correct output should retain original positions: top-left component (likely including the 7 or whatever at input (0,0)) untouched at top, other C groups >=3 erased to 0 creating gaps (e.g., possible removal of some 3's or 5's if they form non-top C groups, leaving floating 4's at row4-7 col2, 8's at row5-7 col6, 5's at row8 col6-7, 9 at row9-11 col10, with empties in between like row8 col3:0), and all non-C groups (e.g., 1's, 2's) staying exactly in place without any dropping or packing.
 * The generated test output mismatches by shifting blocks down (e.g., 7 likely from top to bottom, no floating 4's or 8's), similar to training failures; without the test input, exact differences are unknown, but the lack of gaps confirms gravity is wrongly applied.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 20:05:04] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 5 train examples, only the following interactions and connections are obvious, consistent across **every** train input/output pair, and supported by direct property comparisons (e.g., bbox shifts, pixel counts, color matching). I focused solely on patterns that appear identically in all cases, ignoring unique or variable behaviors. No high-level puzzle solving or total explanations are included. Unknown transformations (e.g., why specific downward shifts vary by 2-5 units or why some components disappear without clear bbox overlap) are noted as such.

- **1x1 component at fixed position [0,0,0,0] interacts with global structure via color property**:  
  This component (pixels=1, holes=0) always remains unchanged in position, size, and pixels across all inputs and outputs. Its color (e.g., Light Blue in train 1, Yellow in trains 2/4, Pink in train 3, Dark Red in train 5) consistently correlates with transformations in other components (e.g., downward bbox y-shifts or disappearances in same-color components elsewhere). No other position-based interaction (e.g., adjacency) is consistent, as its bbox never overlaps or touches others in every example. Unknown: Exact mechanism of color's effect on non-adjacent components.

- **Same-color components as 1x1 at [0,0,0,0] exhibit position or existence change**:  
  In every example, if another component matches the 1x1's color, it either shifts its bbox (e.g., y-increase indicating downward movement) or disappears from the output list (implying transformation or merge without pixel conservation to other colors). Examples: Yellow components shift/disappear when 1x1 is Yellow (trains 2/4); Pink component disappears when 1x1 is Pink (train 3); Dark Red components shift/disappear when 1x1 is Dark Red (train 5). This is the only color-to-position/existence interaction consistent across all; no cross-color effects (e.g., Yellow affecting Red) hold in every case. Unknown: Why pixel counts do not always conserve (e.g., disappeared components do not add to others).

- **Red components connect positionally to support vertical bbox alignment**:  
  Red components (often vertical or horizontal, pixels=3-8) consistently adjust their bbox y-coordinates in alignment with adjacent upper components' shifts (e.g., all move down by the same delta in trains 2-5, staying at similar relative y-distance). In train 1 (no shift), they remain stable. This position-to-position interaction (Red bbox y tracks nearby components' y) occurs in every example, but only for Reds near other shifting pieces; no color change or pixel alteration is consistent. Unknown: Why horizontal Reds (e.g., [2,8,9,8]) sometimes shift entire bbox while vertical ones extend in y only.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., Orange-to-Green position links vary by example; hole count=0 is universal but non-interactive; no consistent color-to-color merges without same-color adjacency post-shift; test inputs not analyzed for patterns as they are outside train consistency check). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated Yellow at bottom-right in some examples) excluded as they show no interaction in every case.

[2025-09-30 20:06:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colored blocks, where connected groups (likely 4-way adjacent) of 3 or more identical numbers are removed, followed by gravity that causes the remaining blocks to fall down in their columns while preserving relative order, filling from the bottom with empty spaces (0s) at the top. The goal of the program is to simulate one step of this process on the input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected groups are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * Only groups of size 3 or more are removed; smaller groups or singles stay.
 * After removal, gravity is applied per column: collect all remaining non-zero values in their original top-to-bottom order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column (row index len-1 downward), with 0s filling the top rows—no gaps allowed in any column after packing.
 * The program always applies gravity, even if no removal occurs, which could incorrectly pack grids that already have no gaps.
 * Row 0 is the top row, row len-1 is the bottom; empty space at top after gravity.
 * Likely only one specific group is removed per step (not all groups), but the current logic picks the wrong one (connected to (0,0) only if non-zero); possible rules include removing the largest group, the group touching the bottom-left, or the group with the topmost/leftmost cell.
 * Subtlety: If top-left (0,0) is 0, no removal happens, but gravity still runs, potentially altering stable grids incorrectly.
 * Repeated removal/gravity cycles may be needed if new groups form after falling, but expected outputs still show remaining groups of 3+, suggesting single removal + single gravity only.
 * Inputs likely have no initial gaps (full or near-full grids), so incorrect removal leads to wrong post-gravity configurations.
 * Expected outputs show configurations with what appear to be gaps in some columns (e.g., non-zeros separated by 0s in the same column), which contradicts full per-column packing—possibly indicating that gravity only fills specific holes from removals (not full repack), or that multiple selective removals occur without full repacking each time, or even that 0s are not treated as empty spaces for falling.
 * Different training examples have varying bottom-left values (e.g., 9 in train1, 4 in train4, 7 in train5), which appear in generated bottoms but in expected "top-left singles," suggesting the removal logic misses the key group containing that cell.
 * Unclear if removal happens before or after any initial gravity, or if the grid wraps/ has special rules for edges.

    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements 4-way connected component finding via DFS/stack, removal by setting to 0, and per-column gravity packing to the bottom preserving order—these are solid building blocks.
 * Gravity packing works as intended (no gaps in columns post-pack in generated outputs), but expected outputs appear to have gaps in some columns (e.g., train1 col4 has non-zeros at rows 2-5 and 8, with 0s at 6-7 and 9-11), suggesting either partial falling (only above removed cells) instead of full repack, or multiple steps, or that 0s don't allow passing through.
 * Removal logic is broken: only targets component from fixed (0,0) if non-zero there, leading to no removal or wrong group in all cases; e.g., train1 generated packs everything to bottom with intact large 2-group at bottom and 9 at bottom-left, but expected isolates 9 at top-left, connects 1's horizontally/vertically, and leaves scattered groups like 5's and 3's with apparent gaps.
 * Train1: Generated fully packs to bottom (e.g., 9 at row11 col0, 4's stacked at row8-11 col1, big 2's at row11 col2-9), but expected has 9 isolated at row0 col0, 4's at row8-11 col1 (correct pack for that column), but gaps in col2 (6's at row5-7, 2 at row8, 0s below) and col4 (5's at row2-4, 3 at row5, 2 at row8, 0s elsewhere)—different because wrong group removed, no gaps in generated.
 * Train2: Generated packs to bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, 6's stacked at row9-11 col1, 9's at row8-10 col2), but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 6's at row9-11 col1 and scattered 0s/gaps in col2 (9 at row6-8, 5 at row9, 0 at row10, etc.)—mismatch in isolated 4 position and gaps; unknown why 5's connect horizontally in row5 but not packed fully.
 * Train3: Similar to train2, generated packs to bottom (6 at row11 col0), expected has 6 at row0 col0, with gaps like 0s interrupting 9's and 5's in lower rows—wrong starting cell for component finding leads to no/different removal.
 * Train4: Generated has 4 at row11 col0, packs big 2's to row11, but expected has 4 at row0 col0, 1's connected but isolated 5's vertical with gaps below—no removal of 1's group in generated, but expected shows partial connections and bottom-packed 2's/7's without the upper clutter.
 * Train5: Generated has 7 at row11 col0, packs to bottom, but expected has 7 at row0 col0, with 5's and 1's scattered low with gaps (e.g., col4 has 5 at row6-8, but 0s below)—mismatch in single 7 position and failure to connect/remove specific groups like 1's.
 * The find_top_left_component function is broken for cases where (0,0) is 0 (skips removal entirely) or when the target group isn't connected to (0,0); not helpful as-is, modify to find the correct starting cell (e.g., bottom-left or largest group).
 * deepcopy is helpful for non-mutating the input.
 * Overall, attempt misunderstands which group to remove (likely not top-left), leading to incorrect configurations; gravity is applied but on wrong post-removal grid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed pattern as training examples: full packing to bottom with no gaps (e.g., 7 at row11 col0, 3's stacked at row9-11 col1, 1's at row11 col2-4, 2's at row11 col6-9, 9's at row10-11 col10), suggesting a removal (possibly of a top group including 4's and others) but wrong one, since training shows similar bottom-packed results are incorrect.
 * It leaves potential groups intact (e.g., vertical 3's in col4 rows4-6? Wait, row4 col4=3, row5=3, row6=3, row7=3? row7 col4=3 yes, 4 connected 3's not removed; horizontal 7's in row7 col7,10? scattered), and isolates pieces like single 6 at row8 col2, but expected likely wants a single at top-left (perhaps the 7) and specific connections/gaps as in training.
 * Does not match likely correct output, which should remove a key group (e.g., the 1's at bottom row11 col2-4 connected to row10 col3-4? or 2's at row11 col6-9), then gravity with possible apparent gaps if partial falling, resulting in something like [7,0,0...] at top and reconnected pieces lower without full bottom-packing of everything.
 * To handle test, update to find/remove the connected group starting from bottom-left cell (row11 col0=7), as patterns suggest bottom-left value ends up isolated at top-left after correct removal + gravity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a SameGame-style puzzle where the goal is to simulate a single "move" on a grid of colored blocks (represented by numbers): identify and remove one connected group of 3 or more identical colors that includes the top-left non-zero cell, then apply gravity to make remaining blocks fall down into empty spaces (packing each column from the bottom). The program processes only one such removal and packing step per input grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are 4-way (up, down, left, right); diagonal does not count.
 * The group to remove must be exactly the connected component containing the top-left cell (position [0][0], assuming it's non-zero); do not remove other disconnected groups of the same color, even if they are also size >=3—this is a key subtlety, as the current program removes all large groups of the top-left color, leading to over-removal.
 * Removal only happens if the connected group size is >=3; if <3, no removal or packing occurs (grid unchanged).
 * After removal, empty spaces (0s) are filled by shifting blocks down in each column independently—no horizontal movement or sliding between columns.
 * The top-left cell determines the color to target, but only its specific connected component is considered; other colors or groups are ignored in this step.
 * Grids are variable size but rectangular (e.g., 12x12 in examples); boundaries must be respected in neighbor checks.
 * Subtlety: After packing, new groups may form, but the program only simulates one removal and one packing—no cascading removals in a single step.
 * If the top-left is already 0, likely no action (but examples suggest inputs have non-zero there).
 * Outputs must match exactly, including positions of remaining blocks after packing; minor shifts (e.g., wrong column packing) cause mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: Packing starts from the bottom of each column, collecting non-zeros and placing them at the bottom, leaving 0s at the top—reversing this (e.g., packing from top) would fail.
 * In examples, removals create "islands" that pack differently; e.g., isolated blocks stay in their columns but shift down.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful and mostly correct, with minor tweaks needed (e.g., to target only the top-left component):
```python
def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
```python
def find_component(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, target_color: int, visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    stack = [(r, c)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != target_color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, len(g), len(g[0])):
            stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Note: This uses DFS via stack; it's correct for finding one component but should be called only once for the top-left cell, not iterated over the whole grid.)
```python
def pack_column_from_bottom(g: List[List[int]], c: int):
    rows = len(g)
    non_zeros = [g[r][c] for r in range(rows) if g[r][c] != 0]
    for r in range(rows):
        if r < rows - len(non_zeros):
            g[r][c] = 0
        else:
            g[r][c] = non_zeros[r - (rows - len(non_zeros))]
```
```python
def apply_packing_gravity(g: List[List[int]]):
    cols = len(g[0])
    for c in range(cols):
        pack_column_from_bottom(g, c)
```
(The overall program structure is helpful: deepcopy input, get color from [0][0], conditionally remove and pack.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `remove_large_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> bool`: Broken for this puzzle—it iterates over the entire grid and removes ALL connected components of the target color that are >=3, instead of only the one containing [0][0]. This causes over-removal (e.g., multiple groups cleared when only one should be). Do not use as-is; modify to call `find_component` only on (0,0) and remove if len >=3.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt provided; it succeeded on Training example 1 (likely because the top-left color had only one large group, so removing all large groups of that color coincidentally matched removing just the top-left one).
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output cleared far too many cells (e.g., entire columns to 0s at top, with scattered remnants like 2s and 8s not packed correctly), resulting in a mostly empty grid; expected keeps more structure (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 9s and 5s packed in columns 2-3, 2s in column 5, 7s and 3s lower down)—difference is over-removal of multiple 5/7/3/2/8/9 groups of the top-left color, instead of just one group.
 * Failed on Training example 3: Generated has excessive clearing (e.g., many 0s at top, 2s partially removed and poorly packed, 4s/5s/9s scattered); expected preserves more (e.g., 6 at bottom-left, 8s packed in column 9, 5s/2s/7s/3s/4s in specific lower positions)—again, over-removal of multiple groups of the same color (likely top-left is 6 or similar), leaving wrong packing (e.g., 5s not grouped as in expected).
 * Failed on Training example 4: Generated packs incorrectly after removal (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/7 groups shifted wrong, with 0s not fully at top and blocks like 2s/7s not falling fully); expected has cleaner packing (e.g., 4 at bottom-left, 5s/1s stacked in column 4, 3s/6s/5s/7s lower with 0s above)—issue is removing too much (possibly multiple 2/7 groups) and flawed packing (e.g., 1s not consolidated).
 * Failed on Training example 5: Similar to 4, generated has wrong shifts (e.g., 5/1/3/6/2/4/7 groups not packed from bottom correctly, 0s misplaced); expected isolates 7 at bottom-left, packs 5s/1s higher with 0s below them incorrectly in generated—over-removal (multiple 2/4 groups) and packing bug (non-zeros not collected properly, leading to mid-column 0s).
 * Across attempts (inferred from pattern), the core issue is treating the move as "remove all large groups of top-left color" instead of "remove only the connected group containing top-left cell"; this works coincidentally for simple cases (train 1) but fails when multiple disconnected groups exist.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level analysis attempted, but not needed—direct component finding suffices.
 * Copy.deepcopy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Visited set prevents re-processing but is underused (iterates whole grid unnecessarily).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows partial removal and packing (e.g., 4s/3s/6s/5s/1s/2s/9s/7 shifted down, but with excessive 0s at top and incomplete consolidation—e.g., 1s/2s/5s not fully packed in columns 6-9, 9s isolated in column 10), suggesting over-removal of multiple groups (likely of color 7 or 3 from bottom-left/top). This mismatches the expected behavior, which should only remove the specific connected group including [0][0] (probably a small 7 or similar at bottom, but wait—grids are printed top-to-bottom, so [0][0] is top-left, likely a high number or 0? Input not shown, but output has 0s at top post-pack, implying removal affected upper areas wrong). To fix, mentally simulating: Assume input has top-left as, say, 7; only remove its connected >=3 group (e.g., the 1s/2s chain at bottom), then pack—expected would have 7 isolated at bottom-left, 3s/4s/6s/5s/8?/9 falling in their columns without clearing unrelated 5s/2s. The output clears too much (e.g., 8s gone, 5s scattered), confirming the multi-group removal bug; it does not make sense as a single-move simulation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a match-3 style puzzle game simulation where groups of 3 or more orthogonally connected cells (4-way adjacency: up, down, left, right) with the same value (color) are identified and removed in a single step, after which the remaining cells in each column fall down due to gravity and pack tightly from the bottom, leaving empty (0) spaces at the top. The program seems intended to process one such step starting from the top-left cell's color, but it includes flawed logic for handling cases where the initial component is too small, leading to incorrect removals and packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections are strictly 4-way (no diagonals), and components must be exactly the same value to count as connected; isolated or smaller groups (<3 cells) are not removed.
 * Removal happens only for components of size >=3; the program searches for such components of the initial top-left color (C) if the starting one is too small, but this leads to over-removal or incorrect targeting in some cases.
 * After removal, gravity applies per column independently: non-zero cells slide down to the bottom, filling from row len-1 upward, with zeros pushed to the top; this must preserve the exact order of surviving cells in each column.
 * Subtle issue: The program modifies the grid in-place but has a hacky restoration step (if initial component <3, reset h[0][0] to C and set h[-1][0] to 0), which incorrectly reinserts or clears cells unrelated to the puzzle rules, causing mismatches like extra zeros or misplaced values.
 * Empty grid or all-zero top-left (C=0) should return unchanged; deep copy is used to avoid mutating input.
 * Puzzle likely assumes fixed 12x12 grid size based on outputs, but rows/cols are dynamic; no horizontal shifting or wrapping.
 * Multiple components of the same color may exist, but only those >=3 are removed—program attempts to find them but visits incorrectly, potentially missing or double-counting.
 * After packing, no further matches are resolved in this step; it's a single removal + gravity operation.
 * Expected outputs show specific patterns like horizontal lines of 1's or 5's forming after packing, vertical stacks preserving order, and isolated cells dropping correctly without merging different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Packing must collect non-zeros in their original top-to-bottom order and place them at the bottom; reversing or shuffling breaks this (e.g., in Train 1, generated has duplicated rows like [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] twice, indicating failed packing).

```
These functions correctly handle neighbor finding, DFS-based component extraction (using stack for iterative search), in-place zeroing, and per-column gravity packing (preserves order by collecting non-zeros top-to-bottom and placing at bottom).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a deep copy and correctly identifies the initial color C from top-left, but fails to remove only valid (>=3) components of that color without side effects.
 * Component finding works for isolated groups (e.g., stack-based DFS avoids recursion issues), but the main logic over-searches: if initial component <3, it scans the entire grid for other C-components >=3 and removes them, which succeeds in some vertical drops but causes incorrect packing in others (e.g., duplicates rows or fails to drop properly).
 * Packing functions are helpful and mostly correct, but applied after flawed removal, leading to zeros not fully propagating to top (e.g., in Train 1 generated, row 7 has [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] which should have dropped further to match expected horizontal 1's and 5's).
 * The restoration hack (if len(component)<3, set h[0][0]=C and h[-1][0]=0) is broken and unhelpful: it reinserts C incorrectly (e.g., in Train 1, places 9 at top but messes bottom-left), causing mismatches like extra 9's or cleared cells unrelated to rules—remove this entirely.
 * Train 1: Generated has incorrect packing (e.g., duplicated [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,7,7,0] rows, 1's not horizontally connected/dropped as in expected [0,0,0,0,5,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]), and bottom row [0,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,0] misses expected vertical 7's stacking; differs from expected by failing to remove a >=3 group of 1's or 5's properly.
 * Train 2: Generated packs some 2's and 5's but leaves gaps (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] instead of expected merged 5's), and bottom [0,6,5,5,0,1,7,7,7,7,3,0] has extra 5's not dropped; differs by not removing a horizontal 7's or vertical 5's group.
 * Train 3: Generated drops 2's but fails to connect 5's horizontally (row 4 [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,2,5,5,5,8,0,0]), and 4's/3's not packed correctly; differs by missing removal of 4's group and incorrect 7's/3's stacking.
 * Train 4: Similar to Train 1, generated has undropped 1's/5's (row 7 [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,1,0,0,0] vs expected row 5 equivalent), and 3's not horizontally removed/packed; bottom row correct but mid-grid gaps persist.
 * Train 5: Generated clears too much (e.g., row 8 [0,4,6,0,5,3,0,5,1,0,0,0] misses expected 1's connection), and packs 2's/3's incorrectly without horizontal 1's forming; differs by not removing scattered 1's or 5's properly, leading to partial drops.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of components and gravity but fails due to flawed main logic (over-removal + hack); no extraction of all objects attempted, but component finder could be extended to scan all >=3 groups regardless of starting color (subtle: puzzle may remove all matching groups in one step, not just of C).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows partial drops (e.g., row 4 [0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] with isolated 4/3 not packed down fully, row 8 [0,0,6,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0] with 5's not connected horizontally as likely expected, bottom row [0,3,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,9,0] suggesting a 1's group and 2's group were removed but 5/9 not handled right).
 * Compared to puzzle rules, it seems to have removed some >=3 groups (e.g., possible 1's horizontal and 2's horizontal at bottom), but packing is incomplete—e.g., column 2 has 4's stacked mid-grid instead of bottom, column 10 has 9's not dropping alone; expected likely has tighter bottom-packing like vertical 3's/5's/9's and horizontal connections post-drop (e.g., 5's merging in col 6-7).
 * Differs from sensible output by leaving mid-grid gaps (e.g., row 9 [0,3,6,3,1,0,2,5,0,0,9,0] has scattered values that should drop per column), and top 7 unchanged but possibly irrelevant; unknown why 8's in col 6 didn't drop fully or if a 5's group was missed—output looks like partial simulation without full grid scan for all removable components.
 * To handle test, program needs to find/remove ALL >=3 components of ANY color (not just C), then pack; current version ties to top-left, causing misses.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle simulates a single step of a falling-block or match-3 game on a 12x12 grid, where connected groups (4-way adjacency) of 3 or more cells of the same color as the top-left cell (0,0) are removed, except for the group containing (0,0) itself to preserve an isolated or special top-left piece; remaining cells then fall downward under gravity, with a special rule for column 0 that fixes row 0 in place while packing rows 1-11 from the bottom, and standard bottom-packing for other columns. The goal is to produce a transformed grid after exactly one removal and gravity application, without chaining multiple removals or altering non-target colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and only groups of size >=3 of the exact color at (0,0) are targeted for removal—other colors and smaller groups (<3) of the target color are untouched.
 * The top-left cell (0,0) and its entire connected component must be preserved, even if large, to keep it "isolated" or fixed at the top; scanning must mark this component first to skip it during removal.
 * Gravity packing is column-wise and order-preserving (top-to-bottom order of non-zeros maintained as they fall to the bottom); for column 0, row 0 stays fixed regardless of its value, and only rows 1-11 are packed (non-zeros shift to rows 11 downward, zeros fill from row 1 up), which can leave gaps or isolate pieces differently than full-column packing.
 * No repeated removal steps—only one pass of identifying/removing qualifying groups, then one gravity application; the puzzle does not chain matches.
 * Grid is always 12x12, with 0 representing empty; input has non-zeros only in lower rows typically, but output can have empties at top.
 * Subtle: Packing in column 0 can cause "floating" non-zeros in rows 1+ if fewer than 11, and the fixed row 0 might be 0 or non-zero, affecting visual isolation; other columns pack fully, potentially aligning pieces horizontally for future matches (but not relevant here).
 * Easy to miss: Removal only affects the top-left color—other large groups of different colors stay; also, if (0,0) is 0, no removals occur.
 * Components must be found via DFS or BFS without revisiting; deep copy input to avoid mutating original.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show partial packings (e.g., gaps in columns) and preserved small groups or singles of the target color, suggesting the preservation rule is key but incompletely applied.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the top-left color and attempts to preserve its component while removing other >=3 groups of that color, using solid DFS for components and special packing for column 0, showing understanding of isolation and gravity rules.
 * What worked: Component detection and removal logic skips the (0,0) group properly; special packing for col 0 fixes row 0 and packs below correctly in isolation; deep copy prevents input mutation; handles empty grids or 0 at (0,0).
 * What didn't work: Fails to match any training expected outputs, likely because removal is too aggressive or incomplete—e.g., in Train 1, generated packs everything too low without gaps (e.g., row 2 all 0s, but expected has 1s in row 2 cols 6-9 and 5s/1s lower with gaps); in Train 2, generated leaves 5s and 7s unpacked incorrectly (e.g., row 10 has 5 at col 3 but expected has it lower); similar over-packing or missed preservations in Train 3 (e.g., 4s in row 8 col 3-5 expected connected but generated scatters them) and Train 4/5 (e.g., 1s and 5s not gapped as in expected, 2s row packed fully but expected has higher empties).
 * Subtleties missed: Packing order may not preserve relative positions across rows correctly after removal (e.g., expected shows staggered falls creating gaps); possibly needs to remove only after scanning all, or handle isolated small groups (<3) of target color that fall differently; unknown why generated Train 1 has duplicate rows 8-9 (4,6,0,5,3 etc.) but expected spreads 6s/3s with zeros.
 * Function `remove_other_large_groups_of_color` is helpful but buggy— it marks (0,0) component correctly but may not scan exhaustively if components overlap or if (0,0) color is absent; still useful with fixes.
 * `apply_gravity_packing_special` composes packing well but applies too uniformly, ignoring that removals create uneven heights per column that expected preserves (e.g., not all columns fall fully).
 * Overall, attempt grasps core removal/packing but mismatches on gap creation and partial falls, suggesting puzzle may involve no removal if (0,0) component is the only large one, or different adjacency (but 4-way seems right).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it over-packs columns with no gaps (e.g., col 2 has 4s packed to rows 4-7 but likely should have gaps like in Train 1 expected; col 4 has 3s in rows 4-11 but expected patterns suggest staggered 3s/1s with zeros above them partially).
 * Missing preservations: Target color is 7 at (0,0), but generated keeps everything low without removing any 7 groups (there are no large 7s visible in input anyway), yet packs col 0 rows 1+ fully (e.g., 3s at bottom), while expected would likely isolate small 7s or other pieces higher with gaps (based on Train patterns, e.g., 1s/2s/5s should have voids like in Train 2/3).
 * Does not match puzzle logic: Input has scattered 3s/1s/5s/2s that might form small groups post-fall, but generated mashes 1s/5s/2s at bottom row 11 without the expected spreading (e.g., row 11 has 1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,9 but should have more zeros and higher placements per Train 4/5); col 0 packs 3s too low, ignoring potential fixed row 0 isolation.
 * Unclear why, but generated ignores potential small target-color groups (no 7s elsewhere), leading to uniform fall that doesn't create the "partial stack" seen in expecteds (e.g., 8s in col 6 stay mid-grid in input but pack down fully).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a block removal puzzle where the color (number) at the top-left cell (0,0) determines the target color C, and all connected components (4-way adjacent) of C with 3 or more blocks are removed, except the component containing the top-left cell itself, which always remains intact regardless of its size. Removals set cells to 0, but no gravity or packing is applied—blocks stay in their original positions, creating gaps where removals occur.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * Only components of the exact color C = grid[0][0] are eligible for removal; groups of other colors are never touched, even if >=3.
 * The component containing (0,0) is exempt from removal, even if it has >=3 blocks—this is a key subtlety, as it protects the "starting" group.
 * If grid[0][0] == 0 or the grid is empty, no changes occur.
 * Removals happen in a single pass: identify and remove all qualifying components without iteration (no chain reactions).
 * No gravity: after setting removed cells to 0, the grid retains all original positions of surviving blocks, leading to floating blocks and gaps (empties) in columns, which is easy to miss if assuming standard falling mechanics.
 * Components smaller than 3 (even of color C) are left untouched.
 * Use a visited set to avoid re-processing cells during component search.
 * The puzzle processes the entire grid, but prioritizes marking the top-left component first to exclude it.
 * Subtle: the removal only triggers if at least one qualifying component is found; otherwise, return the original grid unchanged.
 * Across attempts, failing to exclude the top-left component or applying gravity shifts blocks, mismatching expected outputs with gaps and floating elements.
 * Inputs seem to be 12x12 grids (based on outputs), with row 0 as top.

(Note: The pack_column_from_bottom and apply_gravity_packing functions from the attempt are broken/not helpful for this puzzle, as they incorrectly shift blocks to the bottom, creating no gaps and mismatching expected outputs with floating blocks; do not use them in future attempts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, likely because no qualifying components were removed (e.g., no other C groups >=3), so the grid was unchanged, and erroneous gravity had no visible effect.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated packs all surviving blocks to the bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, scattered blocks in rows 5-11 with no gaps), but expected leaves the top-left 4 at row0 col0, packs nothing (e.g., three 5's at row6 col6-8 stay in place, three 9's at row6-8 col2 stay, four 7's at row11 col6-9 stay, with gaps like row10 col2:0 and row11 col2:0 below a 5 at row9 col2).
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated packs to bottom (e.g., 6 at row11? but print shows partial packing with blocks in rows 5-11), but expected has top-left 6 at row0 col0, no overall shift (e.g., three 5's at row4 col6-8 stay, three 8's at row2-4 col9 stay vertical with empties below, three 4's at row8 col3-5 stay, four 7's at row9 col6-9 stay, gaps like row10 col6:0 below 7 at row9 col6).
 * Training 4: Incorrect; generated fully packs to bottom (e.g., 4 at row11 col0, all blocks squeezed into rows 8-11 with no gaps, like 6's and 3's consecutive in col2-3), but expected leaves 4 at row0 col0 floating, with gaps (e.g., 5 at row6-7 col4 above 3 at row8 col4 with row9-11 col4:0/2, 1's at row6-7 col8 above nothing, no shifting of 6-3-2 in col2).
 * Training 5: Incorrect; generated packs to bottom (e.g., 7 at row11 col0, blocks in rows 8-11 like 4's and 6's shifted down), but expected has 7 at row0 col0, gaps preserved (e.g., 5 at row6-8 col4 with nothing below until row11, 1's at row7 col8 isolated, 4-6-2 in col1 with no shift).
 * Overall, the component finding and visited logic worked well to identify and skip the top-left group while targeting other C groups >=3, but applying gravity universally shifted all columns down, eliminating gaps and moving surviving blocks (including non-C ones) to bottom rows, which never matches expected structures with position-preserved gaps and floating elements.
 * No evidence of needing to remove the top-left component or handle other colors, as expected outputs retain non-C groups intact in place.
 * deepcopy was helpful to avoid mutating the original grid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial-to-full packing towards the bottom (e.g., empty rows 0-3, 4's stacked at row4-7 col2 without gaps above but with empties below some like row8 col6:5,5 but row9 col6:2 with no shift, 7 at row11 col0 dropped down, 3's and 6's in col1-2 rows9-11 packed consecutively), which indicates gravity was applied per column, creating no gaps in surviving stacks.
 * Based on training patterns, the correct output should retain original positions: top-left component (likely including the 7 or whatever at input (0,0)) untouched at top, other C groups >=3 erased to 0 creating gaps (e.g., possible removal of some 3's or 5's if they form non-top C groups, leaving floating 4's at row4-7 col2, 8's at row5-7 col6, 5's at row8 col6-7, 9 at row9-11 col10, with empties in between like row8 col3:0), and all non-C groups (e.g., 1's, 2's) staying exactly in place without any dropping or packing.
 * The generated test output mismatches by shifting blocks down (e.g., 7 likely from top to bottom, no floating 4's or 8's), similar to training failures; without the test input, exact differences are unknown, but the lack of gaps confirms gravity is wrongly applied.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 5 train examples, only the following interactions and connections are obvious, consistent across **every** train input/output pair, and supported by direct property comparisons (e.g., bbox shifts, pixel counts, color matching). I focused solely on patterns that appear identically in all cases, ignoring unique or variable behaviors. No high-level puzzle solving or total explanations are included. Unknown transformations (e.g., why specific downward shifts vary by 2-5 units or why some components disappear without clear bbox overlap) are noted as such.

- **1x1 component at fixed position [0,0,0,0] interacts with global structure via color property**:  
  This component (pixels=1, holes=0) always remains unchanged in position, size, and pixels across all inputs and outputs. Its color (e.g., Light Blue in train 1, Yellow in trains 2/4, Pink in train 3, Dark Red in train 5) consistently correlates with transformations in other components (e.g., downward bbox y-shifts or disappearances in same-color components elsewhere). No other position-based interaction (e.g., adjacency) is consistent, as its bbox never overlaps or touches others in every example. Unknown: Exact mechanism of color's effect on non-adjacent components.

- **Same-color components as 1x1 at [0,0,0,0] exhibit position or existence change**:  
  In every example, if another component matches the 1x1's color, it either shifts its bbox (e.g., y-increase indicating downward movement) or disappears from the output list (implying transformation or merge without pixel conservation to other colors). Examples: Yellow components shift/disappear when 1x1 is Yellow (trains 2/4); Pink component disappears when 1x1 is Pink (train 3); Dark Red components shift/disappear when 1x1 is Dark Red (train 5). This is the only color-to-position/existence interaction consistent across all; no cross-color effects (e.g., Yellow affecting Red) hold in every case. Unknown: Why pixel counts do not always conserve (e.g., disappeared components do not add to others).

- **Red components connect positionally to support vertical bbox alignment**:  
  Red components (often vertical or horizontal, pixels=3-8) consistently adjust their bbox y-coordinates in alignment with adjacent upper components' shifts (e.g., all move down by the same delta in trains 2-5, staying at similar relative y-distance). In train 1 (no shift), they remain stable. This position-to-position interaction (Red bbox y tracks nearby components' y) occurs in every example, but only for Reds near other shifting pieces; no color change or pixel alteration is consistent. Unknown: Why horizontal Reds (e.g., [2,8,9,8]) sometimes shift entire bbox while vertical ones extend in y only.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., Orange-to-Green position links vary by example; hole count=0 is universal but non-interactive; no consistent color-to-color merges without same-color adjacency post-shift; test inputs not analyzed for patterns as they are outside train consistency check). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated Yellow at bottom-right in some examples) excluded as they show no interaction in every case.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:14:04] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a match-3 style grid puzzle where connected groups (4-way adjacent) of 3 or more identical numbers (colors) are identified and removed by setting them to 0, after which gravity causes the remaining cells above in each column to fall down to fill the gaps (no horizontal shifting). The process may involve protecting or specially handling the connected component containing the top-left non-zero cell, while removing qualifying groups of other colors or unprotected groups of the same color, potentially in a single pass or iteratively until stable.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and must be the same number; diagonals do not count.
 * Groups of exactly 3 or more same-number cells are removed (set to 0); smaller groups (1 or 2) are left intact.
 * The top-left non-zero cell's color (C) has a connected component that is protected from removal, even if >=3, but other components of color C >=3 are removed.
 * All colors (not just C) have their >=3 groups removed, except the protected top-left component; the code only handles C, missing other colors.
 * After removals, apply gravity per column: non-zero cells fall down to the bottom, filling from row 0 upward? No, grids are row 0 at top, so falling means shifting down (higher row indices) to fill gaps, with top rows becoming 0.
 * Outputs show shifted positions (e.g., in train2 expected, the 2-5-8 group in row2 generated moves to row5, and upper rows clear; in train4, upper groups clear and lower ones shift up? Wait, inconsistency—actually, standard gravity is from top: cells fall down, so empties bubble to top (low row indices)).
 * Possibly only one pass of removal + gravity, not iterative (no chain reactions), as outputs stabilize after one shift.
 * Grids are 12x12 based on examples, but code handles variable size.
 * Top-left cell (0,0) if non-zero defines C and its component is marked visited/protected before scanning others.
 * After protection, scan all cells, find components of any color? Code only does for C, but examples remove other colors (e.g., train2 expected removes some 5's? No, 5's stay but shift; actually, in train2, generated keeps 5's high, expected shifts 2's down and clears above, suggesting removal of something above).
 * Subtle: Removals happen simultaneously based on initial grid, then one gravity apply; no re-checking after gravity.
 * Edge case: If top-left is 0, do nothing (code handles).
 * In train3 expected, 9's and 4's shift, 2's partially removed/protected? 2's seem protected as a vertical group.
 * In train4/5, long horizontal 2's (8+ cells) are kept but shift up, suggesting protection if connected to top-left? But top-left is 4/7, not 2.
 * Potential subtlety: Only remove groups of C except top-left, but for other colors, remove all >=3; examples show other colors removed (e.g., train4 expected clears upper 1's and 5's partially? 1's shift down).
 * Gravity is column-independent: for each col, collect non-zeros from bottom up, place them starting from bottom (high rows), pad top with 0s.
 * No: Standard top-down gravity: for each col, remove 0s by shifting non-zeros down (to higher rows), pad top (low rows) with 0s. But in train2 expected, row5 has the group that was row2 in generated, and rows 2-4 are 0, suggesting shift down.
 * Outputs are printed row by row from top (row0) to bottom (row11), with 0s at top after fall.
 * Missable: The protection is only for the component containing (0,0), not all of C; isolated C groups elsewhere >=3 are removed.
 * In test input, vertical 4-3's on left, 8's vertical, 5's horizontal, 1's and 2's lower; likely remove 5's (5 cells), 3's? (3 cells vertical but split?), then gravity shifts everything down.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from copy import deepcopy

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
(This is useful for 4-way adjacency in component finding.)

```python
def find_connected_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not g or g[start_r][start_c] == 0:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    color = g[start_r][start_c]
    visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(start_r, start_c)]
    component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    while stack:
        cr, cc = stack.pop()
        if (cr, cc) in visited or g[cr][cc] != color:
            continue
        visited.add((cr, cc))
        component.append((cr, cc))
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
            if (nr, nc) not in visited and g[nr][nc] == color:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This DFS/stack-based component finder is correct and essential for identifying groups; uses iterative to avoid recursion depth issues.)

```python
def remove_component_cells(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    for r, c in component:
        g[r][c] = 0
```
(Helpful for zeroing out groups after identification; modifies in place.)

```python
def protect_top_left_component(g: List[List[int]], visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    if g[0][0] != 0:
        top_component = find_connected_component(g, 0, 0)
        for r, c in top_component:
            visited.add((r, c))
```
(This is partially useful for protecting the (0,0) component but needs extension to handle all colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt worked for training example 1 (correct output, likely a simple case where only C groups needed handling and no gravity was required or it matched).
 * Failed for training examples 2-5: did not remove >=3 groups of colors other than C (e.g., in train2, kept 5's group of 3+ without removing; in train3, kept 4's and 5's; in train4, kept 1's (4 cells) and 5's (3+); in train5, kept 1's and 5's).
 * No gravity implementation: all incorrect outputs keep original row positions with some 0s, but expected outputs show downward shifts (e.g., train2 generated has 2-5-8- group in row2, expected moves it to row5 with rows 2-4 cleared to 0; train4 generated has 5-1's in row2, expected clears rows 2-5 and shifts to row6+; train3 generated keeps 2's high in rows 2-6, expected shifts 2's down to rows 4-8 and clears above; train5 similar shift for 1's to row7).
 * Only scanned and removed for color C, ignoring other colors' groups (e.g., train2 expected removes implied upper groups, shifting everything; but generated only zeros some C=4? Wait, top is 4, but keeps other colors).
 * Visited set used only for protection and marking removed C cells, but not for avoiding re-processing other colors.
 * In train2, generated row6 has 9's and 2-3's kept, but expected row6 has 2-5-8 shifted there, and row8 has 2-7-2-8 (suggesting partial removal of 2's? But code kept all non-C).
 * Train3 mismatches: generated keeps 2's vertical in col5 rows2-6, 4's in row6 col3-5, but expected removes upper 2's? Shifts 2's to col5 rows4-6 and row8 col8=2, clears row2-3 col5=0, moves 9's down.
 * Train4: generated keeps horizontal 2's in row8 (8+ cells, should remove if not protected), but expected keeps them in row11? No, expected row11 all 0? Wait, expected row8 has 6-3's and 5's, row11 has 2's horizontal—major shift down for 2's, clearing upper 1's (4 connected) and 5's (2? kept).
 * Train5: similar, generated keeps 2's high in row8, expected shifts 2's to row11, removes upper 1's (4) and 5's (3 in row5-6?).
 * Function `remove_other_large_groups` is helpful but limited to color C; needs generalization to all colors except protected component.
 * No function for gravity, which is critical— all mismatches involve unshifted positions.
 * `program` deepcopy is good to avoid mutating input, but main logic incomplete (no full scan, no gravity).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it only zeros some cells (e.g., partial 3's in col4? But keeps vertical 4's in col2 rows2-5, vertical 8's in col6 rows3-5? Wait, output shows row2 col2-4=4,3,3; row6 col3-7=6,5x5; row9 col2-4=3,1,1? But no major zeros except implied), but no removals of clear >=3 groups like the 5's (5 horizontal in row6 col3-7) or 1's (3+ in row9 col3-5 and below), and absolutely no gravity/shifting (e.g., upper 4-3's stay in rows2-5, lower 1-2's in rows9-11; expected likely removes 5's, causing col3-7 to shift down, e.g., 6's fall, 1-2's fall, clear tops; also vertical 3's in col4 rows2,4-5,9-11 may be 3+ connected? But split by 0s). Without gravity, positions don't match any expected pattern from training (e.g., no top clears and bottom fills). It ignores other colors entirely, similar to train failures. To handle test, add full-color group removal (except protect top-left C component), then column-wise gravity: for each col, collect non-zeros in order, place from row0 down? No, from bottom up? Standard: iterate from bottom, shift non-zeros down.
