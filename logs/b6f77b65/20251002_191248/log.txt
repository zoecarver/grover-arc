=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:12:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def preprocess(g: List[List[int]], c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = 12
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for j in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if new_g[i][j] == c and i > 0:
                start = i
                while i < n and new_g[i][j] == c:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 19:41:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 12x12 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-9 represent colors, 0 is empty space) where a specific color c (determined by the top-left non-empty cell g[0][0]) triggers preprocessing to identify and remove or merge certain patterns of that color (likely isolated singles or short sequences not connected to larger groups), followed by gravity simulation to make blocks fall downward into empty spaces, resulting in restacked formations that match expected layouts with specific separations and positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires identifying the "special" color c from g[0][0], which seems to be the trigger for removal rules—only patterns of c are affected in preprocessing, while other colors fall normally.
 * Preprocessing likely removes isolated single blocks of c (length==1 sequences not adjacent to non-zero above) or short unconnected sequences, but merges or propagates if connected; however, the code's logic for this is flawed, as it incorrectly sets singles to the value above or zeros out longer groups indiscriminately.
 * Gravity must fully settle blocks column-by-column, but the one_pass_gravity function only does adjacent swaps in a single bottom-up pass per iteration, which fails to propagate falls fully (e.g., a block needs multiple swaps to reach the bottom if there are multiple empties below); applying it n times helps but isn't efficient or correct for multi-level drops.
 * Expected outputs show "objects" or connected groups (horizontal/vertical runs of same color) falling as units but separating into distinct stacks per column, with some colors (like c) partially removed or not falling fully, leading to gaps and specific heights (e.g., in Train 1, 1's form a horizontal line at row 2, but 5 is stacked below in col 4; 3's in col 3-5 at varying heights).
 * Subtlety: Removals happen before gravity, and only affect c—other colors remain intact but fall around the gaps; connected components of non-c may need to be treated as rigid or fall individually.
 * Blocks don't rotate or connect diagonally; falls are strictly vertical per column, but initial positions suggest horizontal connections influence removal (e.g., in Train 1 expected, the bottom row of 2's is shortened and isolated, 7's stacked in col 10-11).
 * Easy to miss: The top-left c block itself often ends up isolated at the bottom-left of its column in expected outputs (e.g., 9 in Train 1 col 0 row 0; 4 in Train 2 col 0 row 0), suggesting c's group is partially preserved or the rest removed.
 * Across attempts, no matching of group shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated piles all at bottom row 8-11, but expected has distributed heights like row 0 for 9, row 5-8 for 6's/3's); empties persist in specific patterns post-fall.
 * Test input considerations: Involves colors like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with c likely 7 (top-left? Wait, test input starts at bottom? Grids are row 0 top to row 11 bottom); expected should show removals of 7-patterns creating gaps, then falls resulting in staggered stacks (e.g., 3's in col 1 spreading, 9's in col 10 isolated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No truly helpful functions from this attempt; the preprocess is broken (incorrectly zeros long sequences of c and merges singles oddly, e.g., in Train 1 it removes most c=9 but leaves junk; doesn't handle horizontal connections).
# one_pass_gravity is partially useful for basic falling but incomplete (single pass doesn't fully drop multi-level; better to collect non-zeros per column and restack from bottom).
```

```python
# Potential helpful stub for future: extract connected components per color (not in attempt, but needed based on expectations).
def extract_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Find connected (horizontal/vertical) groups of color, return as lists of positions.
    # Useful for identifying removable patterns (e.g., singles or small groups of c).
    visited = [[False]*12 for _ in range(12)]
    groups = []
    for i in range(12):
        for j in range(12):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j]:
                group = []
                # DFS/BFS to find connected component
                # ...
                groups.append(group)
    return groups
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed, with generated outputs consistently piling most blocks at the bottom (rows 8-11) in dense, incorrect formations, while expected outputs have sparse, distributed stacking with specific gaps and isolated top-left c blocks at bottom-left.
 * Train 1: Generated has empty top 7 rows, then mismatched bottom: e.g., row 8 has 5,1's scattered; row 11 has 9 misplaced in col 0 but 4,2's,7's wrong; expected isolates 9 at [0][0], spreads 1's horizontally at row 2 cols 6-9, stacks 5 at col4 rows 3-5, 3's at col3-5 rows 5-8 with gaps, 6's vertical at col2 rows 5-8, 2's horizontal at row 8 cols 2-9 shortened, 7's at col10 rows 5-8/10-11; difference: no removals/gaps preserved, everything over-falls into blob (unknown why preprocess didn't remove more c=9).
 * Train 2: Generated piles at bottom with 2's vertical in col5 rows 4-9, 5's scattered, 8's in col9; expected has 4 isolated at [0][0], 2's vertical col5 rows 4-8, 5's horizontal row5 cols6-8, 8's vertical col9 rows 5-8, 9's vertical col2 rows 6-8, 3's at col10 rows 9-11 with gaps above, 7's scattered; difference: generated merges 5's/7's wrongly at bottom, misses horizontal spreads and upper placements (e.g., 5's should be at row5, not fallen further).
 * Train 3: Generated similar bottom pile: 2's col5, 8's col9-10 with 3/4 mix, 5's scattered; expected isolates 6 at [0][0], 8's vertical col9 rows 2-5, 2's col5 rows 4-8 with 5's horizontal row4 cols6-8, 7's col6 rows 6-8, 3's col10 rows 9-11 gapped, 4's horizontal row8 cols3-5, 9's vertical col2 rows 8-10 gapped below; difference: generated doesn't separate 4's/3's, over-drops everything, c=6 not isolated properly.
 * Train 4: Generated empty top 7 rows, bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8 scattered, 3's col5-6 row9-10, 2's row11 partial; expected has 4 at [0][0], 1's horizontal row6 cols5-8, 5 at col4 rows6-8, 3's col3-5 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols2-9, 7's col10-11 rows9-11 gapped; difference: no upper structures (e.g., 1's should be row6, not row7-8), preprocess fails to remove c=4 patterns correctly.
 * Train 5: Generated bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8, 3's col4-6 row9-10, 2's row11; expected has 7 at [0][0], 5 at col4 rows5-7 isolated, 1's horizontal row7 cols5-8, 3's col2-4 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols1-9; difference: c=7 not isolated, 5's/1's not gapped/upper, everything compacted wrong.
 * Preprocess function is broken/not helpful: incorrectly zeros entire sequences of c longer than 1 and merges singles to above value (e.g., in Train 1, it removes most 9's but leaves artifacts); doesn't detect isolated singles properly (condition "if length==1 and new_g[start-1][j] !=0" is backwards—should remove if no support below?); ignores horizontal connections, treating columns independently.
 * one_pass_gravity is partially helpful for basic drops but insufficient: single bottom-up pass only moves blocks one level per call, requiring n iterations but still fails multi-column interactions or full settling (e.g., in all trains, blocks don't reach exact expected heights/gaps).
 * No extraction of connected objects in attempt, but expectations suggest it's essential to identify removable c-groups (singles or small clusters) before gravity.
 * Overall: Attempts show partial gravity understanding (blocks do fall) but zero grasp of removal rules (no gaps preserved, c not specially handled), leading to over-compacted bottoms; subtle horizontal group preservation missed (e.g., 1's/2's stay horizontal in expected).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows empty top 4 rows, then scattered partial stacks (e.g., 4's vertical col2 rows4-7, 3's col4 rows4-7 and col1 rows9-11, 8's col6 rows5-7, 5's col6-7 row8 and col8 row8? Wait, row8 has 6,5's mixed), bottom row11 with 7,3,1's,5,2's,9 compacted; this over-piles like trains, ignoring gaps.
 * Why not correct: Expected should isolate c (likely 7 from bottom-left? But top-left is unclear in input snippet—assume g[0][0]=7 or similar) at [0][0], create gaps from 7/1 removals (e.g., col0 has 7 at bottom, but input has 7 at row11 col0), then fall others into staggered forms (e.g., 3's in col1/4 should gap like trains, 9 in col10 isolated vertical, 2's horizontal row11 cols6-9, 5's grouped col6-8 row8-10 gapped); generated misses this, compacting everything without preserving structures or upper placements (e.g., no horizontal 1's or separated 8's).
 * To handle test: Need better preprocess to remove isolated 7's/1's (input has 1's at row11 col2-4, likely c-related), full column-restack gravity (collect non-zeros, place from bottom), and detect horizontal connections for non-c groups.

[2025-10-02 19:41:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 19:57:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 12x12 grid where cells contain integers representing colors (0 for empty), involving simulation of plant-like growth or manipulation rules with vertical "stems" (runs of the same color), horizontal "branches" attaching to them, special handling for a "top_color" (the color at grid[0][0]), removal/extension of elements, downward extension through empty spaces, and gravity to drop non-empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Stems are defined as vertical contiguous runs of the same non-zero color with length >=2 in a column; they are identified from top to bottom, skipping zeros.
 * Branches are horizontal contiguous runs of the same color (length >=2) adjacent (left or right) to a stem cell, but only if the branch color differs from the stem color; branches are checked only at specific positions relative to the stem (e.g., at the stem's start row or one row above, via delta [0, -1]).
 * Actions on branches: If branch color matches top_color, remove the entire branch (set to 0); otherwise, clear the branch, optionally clear the attachment point on the stem if it's a "cap end" (when checked at delta=-1, possibly indicating a top-attached branch), extend the stem downward by the stem's length (clamping to grid bottom), and relocate the branch to the new stem end row.
 * After all actions, remove any remaining vertical stems of top_color (length >=2) entirely.
 * Extend all remaining non-zero vertical runs downward by filling contiguous zeros below them with the same color (but do not create new stems).
 * Apply gravity per column: Collect non-zero cells and place them at the bottom of the column, filling top with zeros.
 * Subtleties: Top_color is always g[0][0] at start, suggesting it's a fixed "special" color (e.g., for removal). Branch detection scans left/right from attachment to find full run extents. Stem extension in non-remove actions uses the original stem length, potentially over-extending or clamping at row 11. "Cap end" logic may handle branches at the top of stems differently (e.g., not preserving stem attachment). The code mutates a copy of the grid. Potential misses: No handling for branches overlapping multiple stems, no diagonal or multi-color interactions, assumes integer colors >=1, no validation for grid size, and actions are applied in order without re-checking (possible overlaps). In removal of top_color stems post-actions, it only targets exact top_color runs, skipping others. Gravity is bottom-aligned, standard drop physics.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) identifies stems and branches correctly in structure but fails to execute due to a KeyError: 'stem_color' (the action dict in branches lacks 'stem_color': color when appending, but later code tries to access action['stem_color'] during stem extension in non-remove actions; also, a pass statement skips handling stem start for top_color, marked as "to be fixed").
 * No outputs generated for any training example or test input, so nothing worked in terms of producing grids; all attempts crash immediately on execution.
 * Stem and branch detection loops are logically sound and would work if isolated (e.g., they correctly find runs >=2), but integration into actions is broken.
 * Action application logic partially captures rules (remove top_color branches/stems, extend others down by stem length, cap-end clearing), but untested due to crash; subtle bug in non-remove: it clears branch twice (redundant loop) and sets g[new_r][c] = b_color for the whole branch row, but doesn't preserve order or handle if new_r overlaps existing cells.
 * Post-processing (remove top_color, extend, gravity) is implemented helpfully and would run if actions succeeded, but skips re-extending cleared stems.
 * No handling for cases where branches attach to extended stems or multiple actions per stem; assumes single attachment per delta/side.
 * The code mutates a grid copy (good), but lacks error handling or validation (e.g., if no top_color).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training examples) is an ERROR - Execution error: 'stem_color', so it does not look correct or produce any grid; this prevents verifying if the logic matches expected puzzle outcomes (e.g., no way to see if stems extend properly, branches relocate, or gravity applies as intended).
 * Without generated grids, cannot compare to mentally simulated rules (e.g., for test input, we'd expect specific branch removals if top_color matches, or downward shifts, but error blocks this; difference is total failure vs. any partial grid).
 * To handle test case, must fix dict key omission and test for over-extension (e.g., if stem length pushes new_r >11, clamping occurs but may truncate branches incorrectly).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:57:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 12x12 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-9 represent colors, 0 is empty space) where a specific color c (determined by the top-left non-empty cell g[0][0]) triggers preprocessing to identify and remove or merge certain patterns of that color (likely isolated singles or short sequences not connected to larger groups), followed by gravity simulation to make blocks fall downward into empty spaces, resulting in restacked formations that match expected layouts with specific separations and positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires identifying the "special" color c from g[0][0], which seems to be the trigger for removal rules—only patterns of c are affected in preprocessing, while other colors fall normally.
 * Preprocessing likely removes isolated single blocks of c (length==1 sequences not adjacent to non-zero above) or short unconnected sequences, but merges or propagates if connected; however, the code's logic for this is flawed, as it incorrectly sets singles to the value above or zeros out longer groups indiscriminately.
 * Gravity must fully settle blocks column-by-column, but the one_pass_gravity function only does adjacent swaps in a single bottom-up pass per iteration, which fails to propagate falls fully (e.g., a block needs multiple swaps to reach the bottom if there are multiple empties below); applying it n times helps but isn't efficient or correct for multi-level drops.
 * Expected outputs show "objects" or connected groups (horizontal/vertical runs of same color) falling as units but separating into distinct stacks per column, with some colors (like c) partially removed or not falling fully, leading to gaps and specific heights (e.g., in Train 1, 1's form a horizontal line at row 2, but 5 is stacked below in col 4; 3's in col 3-5 at varying heights).
 * Subtlety: Removals happen before gravity, and only affect c—other colors remain intact but fall around the gaps; connected components of non-c may need to be treated as rigid or fall individually.
 * Blocks don't rotate or connect diagonally; falls are strictly vertical per column, but initial positions suggest horizontal connections influence removal (e.g., in Train 1 expected, the bottom row of 2's is shortened and isolated, 7's stacked in col 10-11).
 * Easy to miss: The top-left c block itself often ends up isolated at the bottom-left of its column in expected outputs (e.g., 9 in Train 1 col 0 row 0; 4 in Train 2 col 0 row 0), suggesting c's group is partially preserved or the rest removed.
 * Across attempts, no matching of group shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated piles all at bottom row 8-11, but expected has distributed heights like row 0 for 9, row 5-8 for 6's/3's); empties persist in specific patterns post-fall.
 * Test input considerations: Involves colors like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with c likely 7 (top-left? Wait, test input starts at bottom? Grids are row 0 top to row 11 bottom); expected should show removals of 7-patterns creating gaps, then falls resulting in staggered stacks (e.g., 3's in col 1 spreading, 9's in col 10 isolated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No truly helpful functions from this attempt; the preprocess is broken (incorrectly zeros long sequences of c and merges singles oddly, e.g., in Train 1 it removes most c=9 but leaves junk; doesn't handle horizontal connections).
# one_pass_gravity is partially useful for basic falling but incomplete (single pass doesn't fully drop multi-level; better to collect non-zeros per column and restack from bottom).
```

```python
# Potential helpful stub for future: extract connected components per color (not in attempt, but needed based on expectations).
def extract_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Find connected (horizontal/vertical) groups of color, return as lists of positions.
    # Useful for identifying removable patterns (e.g., singles or small groups of c).
    visited = [[False]*12 for _ in range(12)]
    groups = []
    for i in range(12):
        for j in range(12):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j]:
                group = []
                # DFS/BFS to find connected component
                # ...
                groups.append(group)
    return groups
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed, with generated outputs consistently piling most blocks at the bottom (rows 8-11) in dense, incorrect formations, while expected outputs have sparse, distributed stacking with specific gaps and isolated top-left c blocks at bottom-left.
 * Train 1: Generated has empty top 7 rows, then mismatched bottom: e.g., row 8 has 5,1's scattered; row 11 has 9 misplaced in col 0 but 4,2's,7's wrong; expected isolates 9 at [0][0], spreads 1's horizontally at row 2 cols 6-9, stacks 5 at col4 rows 3-5, 3's at col3-5 rows 5-8 with gaps, 6's vertical at col2 rows 5-8, 2's horizontal at row 8 cols 2-9 shortened, 7's at col10 rows 5-8/10-11; difference: no removals/gaps preserved, everything over-falls into blob (unknown why preprocess didn't remove more c=9).
 * Train 2: Generated piles at bottom with 2's vertical in col5 rows 4-9, 5's scattered, 8's in col9; expected has 4 isolated at [0][0], 2's vertical col5 rows 4-8, 5's horizontal row5 cols6-8, 8's vertical col9 rows 5-8, 9's vertical col2 rows 6-8, 3's at col10 rows 9-11 with gaps above, 7's scattered; difference: generated merges 5's/7's wrongly at bottom, misses horizontal spreads and upper placements (e.g., 5's should be at row5, not fallen further).
 * Train 3: Generated similar bottom pile: 2's col5, 8's col9-10 with 3/4 mix, 5's scattered; expected isolates 6 at [0][0], 8's vertical col9 rows 2-5, 2's col5 rows 4-8 with 5's horizontal row4 cols6-8, 7's col6 rows 6-8, 3's col10 rows 9-11 gapped, 4's horizontal row8 cols3-5, 9's vertical col2 rows 8-10 gapped below; difference: generated doesn't separate 4's/3's, over-drops everything, c=6 not isolated properly.
 * Train 4: Generated empty top 7 rows, bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8 scattered, 3's col5-6 row9-10, 2's row11 partial; expected has 4 at [0][0], 1's horizontal row6 cols5-8, 5 at col4 rows6-8, 3's col3-5 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols2-9, 7's col10-11 rows9-11 gapped; difference: no upper structures (e.g., 1's should be row6, not row7-8), preprocess fails to remove c=4 patterns correctly.
 * Train 5: Generated bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8, 3's col4-6 row9-10, 2's row11; expected has 7 at [0][0], 5 at col4 rows5-7 isolated, 1's horizontal row7 cols5-8, 3's col2-4 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols1-9; difference: c=7 not isolated, 5's/1's not gapped/upper, everything compacted wrong.
 * Preprocess function is broken/not helpful: incorrectly zeros entire sequences of c longer than 1 and merges singles to above value (e.g., in Train 1, it removes most 9's but leaves artifacts); doesn't detect isolated singles properly (condition "if length==1 and new_g[start-1][j] !=0" is backwards—should remove if no support below?); ignores horizontal connections, treating columns independently.
 * one_pass_gravity is partially helpful for basic drops but insufficient: single bottom-up pass only moves blocks one level per call, requiring n iterations but still fails multi-column interactions or full settling (e.g., in all trains, blocks don't reach exact expected heights/gaps).
 * No extraction of connected objects in attempt, but expectations suggest it's essential to identify removable c-groups (singles or small clusters) before gravity.
 * Overall: Attempts show partial gravity understanding (blocks do fall) but zero grasp of removal rules (no gaps preserved, c not specially handled), leading to over-compacted bottoms; subtle horizontal group preservation missed (e.g., 1's/2's stay horizontal in expected).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows empty top 4 rows, then scattered partial stacks (e.g., 4's vertical col2 rows4-7, 3's col4 rows4-7 and col1 rows9-11, 8's col6 rows5-7, 5's col6-7 row8 and col8 row8? Wait, row8 has 6,5's mixed), bottom row11 with 7,3,1's,5,2's,9 compacted; this over-piles like trains, ignoring gaps.
 * Why not correct: Expected should isolate c (likely 7 from bottom-left? But top-left is unclear in input snippet—assume g[0][0]=7 or similar) at [0][0], create gaps from 7/1 removals (e.g., col0 has 7 at bottom, but input has 7 at row11 col0), then fall others into staggered forms (e.g., 3's in col1/4 should gap like trains, 9 in col10 isolated vertical, 2's horizontal row11 cols6-9, 5's grouped col6-8 row8-10 gapped); generated misses this, compacting everything without preserving structures or upper placements (e.g., no horizontal 1's or separated 8's).
 * To handle test: Need better preprocess to remove isolated 7's/1's (input has 1's at row11 col2-4, likely c-related), full column-restack gravity (collect non-zeros, place from bottom), and detect horizontal connections for non-c groups.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 12x12 grid where cells contain integers representing colors (0 for empty), involving simulation of plant-like growth or manipulation rules with vertical "stems" (runs of the same color), horizontal "branches" attaching to them, special handling for a "top_color" (the color at grid[0][0]), removal/extension of elements, downward extension through empty spaces, and gravity to drop non-empty cells.

 * Actions on branches: If branch color matches top_color, remove the entire branch (set to 0); otherwise, clear the branch, optionally clear the attachment point on the stem if it's a "cap end" (when checked at delta=-1, possibly indicating a top-attached branch), extend the stem downward by the stem's length (clamping to grid bottom), and relocate the branch to the new stem end row.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) identifies stems and branches correctly in structure but fails to execute due to a KeyError: 'stem_color' (the action dict in branches lacks 'stem_color': color when appending, but later code tries to access action['stem_color'] during stem extension in non-remove actions; also, a pass statement skips handling stem start for top_color, marked as "to be fixed").
 * No outputs generated for any training example or test input, so nothing worked in terms of producing grids; all attempts crash immediately on execution.
 * Stem and branch detection loops are logically sound and would work if isolated (e.g., they correctly find runs >=2), but integration into actions is broken.
 * Action application logic partially captures rules (remove top_color branches/stems, extend others down by stem length, cap-end clearing), but untested due to crash; subtle bug in non-remove: it clears branch twice (redundant loop) and sets g[new_r][c] = b_color for the whole branch row, but doesn't preserve order or handle if new_r overlaps existing cells.
 * Post-processing (remove top_color, extend, gravity) is implemented helpfully and would run if actions succeeded, but skips re-extending cleared stems.
 * No handling for cases where branches attach to extended stems or multiple actions per stem; assumes single attachment per delta/side.
 * The code mutates a grid copy (good), but lacks error handling or validation (e.g., if no top_color).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training examples) is an ERROR - Execution error: 'stem_color', so it does not look correct or produce any grid; this prevents verifying if the logic matches expected puzzle outcomes (e.g., no way to see if stems extend properly, branches relocate, or gravity applies as intended).
 * Without generated grids, cannot compare to mentally simulated rules (e.g., for test input, we'd expect specific branch removals if top_color matches, or downward shifts, but error blocks this; difference is total failure vs. any partial grid).
 * To handle test case, must fix dict key omission and test for over-extension (e.g., if stem length pushes new_r >11, clamping occurs but may truncate branches incorrectly).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 20:25:47] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 4 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 5 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 20:26:11] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle task where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a required 'program' function that correctly processes grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) to produce expected outputs for multiple training examples and a test input. The previous attempt failed entirely due to the absence of the core 'program' function, resulting in uniform errors across all evaluations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of other logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid structures (e.g., List[List[int]]) to extract or manipulate visual elements like blobs, objects, holes, or patterns, then outputting results that match expected behaviors for training and test cases.
 * Training examples (1-5) and test input must all pass validation; partial success on some isn't enough—full coverage is required, including handling edge cases like varying grid sizes or object configurations.
 * Subtle elements include ensuring the code is syntactically valid Python, handles input formats precisely (e.g., 2D lists), and produces outputs that align with puzzle rules (e.g., identifying/omitting specific objects based on properties like connectivity or counts).
 * Consider grid traversal techniques (e.g., flood fill for connected components) to detect objects, as visual puzzles often require identifying discrete elements amid noise or overlaps.
 * Outputs should be deterministic and exact matches; any deviation (e.g., wrong object counts or missed patterns) causes failure.
 * No modifications to input formats allowed—code must adapt to given grids without assumptions about dimensions or values.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were present in the previous attempt, as the code lacked even basic structure. Future attempts should include utilities like grid parsing or object detection, e.g.:

```python
from typing import List

def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Example: Flood fill to extract blob positions (helpful for visual object identification)
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in grid]
    components = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][y] != 0 and not visited[x][y]:
                        visited[x][y] = True
                        component.append((x, y))
                        stack.extend([(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)])
                components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def count_holes_in_object(component: List[tuple[int, int]], grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Example: Detect enclosed spaces (holes) within a connected object; useful for puzzles with topology
    # Implementation would involve boundary tracing or parity checks—placeholder for now
    return 0  # To be fleshed out based on puzzle rules
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt generated code without any 'program' function, leading to immediate errors on all training examples (1-5) and the test input.
 * Nothing worked: No valid code structure, no object extraction, no grid processing—complete failure to meet basic requirements.
 * All outputs were identical errors ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), indicating zero progress toward puzzle solving.
 * No helpful functions were included; any potential code snippets (if present) were irrelevant or broken due to the missing core function.
 * This attempt demonstrates no understanding of the puzzle, as it didn't even attempt to define the required function or handle grid inputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates a fundamental structural failure rather than any puzzle-specific result.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, so it cannot match expected puzzle rules (e.g., identifying objects or patterns in the grid); this is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, the test case couldn't be evaluated, missing any opportunity to verify against puzzle expectations like object counts or configurations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 12x12 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-9 represent colors, 0 is empty space) where a specific color c (determined by the top-left non-empty cell g[0][0]) triggers preprocessing to identify and remove or merge certain patterns of that color (likely isolated singles or short sequences not connected to larger groups), followed by gravity simulation to make blocks fall downward into empty spaces, resulting in restacked formations that match expected layouts with specific separations and positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires identifying the "special" color c from g[0][0], which seems to be the trigger for removal rules—only patterns of c are affected in preprocessing, while other colors fall normally.
 * Preprocessing likely removes isolated single blocks of c (length==1 sequences not adjacent to non-zero above) or short unconnected sequences, but merges or propagates if connected; however, the code's logic for this is flawed, as it incorrectly sets singles to the value above or zeros out longer groups indiscriminately.
 * Gravity must fully settle blocks column-by-column, but the one_pass_gravity function only does adjacent swaps in a single bottom-up pass per iteration, which fails to propagate falls fully (e.g., a block needs multiple swaps to reach the bottom if there are multiple empties below); applying it n times helps but isn't efficient or correct for multi-level drops.
 * Expected outputs show "objects" or connected groups (horizontal/vertical runs of same color) falling as units but separating into distinct stacks per column, with some colors (like c) partially removed or not falling fully, leading to gaps and specific heights (e.g., in Train 1, 1's form a horizontal line at row 2, but 5 is stacked below in col 4; 3's in col 3-5 at varying heights).
 * Subtlety: Removals happen before gravity, and only affect c—other colors remain intact but fall around the gaps; connected components of non-c may need to be treated as rigid or fall individually.
 * Blocks don't rotate or connect diagonally; falls are strictly vertical per column, but initial positions suggest horizontal connections influence removal (e.g., in Train 1 expected, the bottom row of 2's is shortened and isolated, 7's stacked in col 10-11).
 * Easy to miss: The top-left c block itself often ends up isolated at the bottom-left of its column in expected outputs (e.g., 9 in Train 1 col 0 row 0; 4 in Train 2 col 0 row 0), suggesting c's group is partially preserved or the rest removed.
 * Across attempts, no matching of group shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated piles all at bottom row 8-11, but expected has distributed heights like row 0 for 9, row 5-8 for 6's/3's); empties persist in specific patterns post-fall.
 * Test input considerations: Involves colors like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with c likely 7 (top-left? Wait, test input starts at bottom? Grids are row 0 top to row 11 bottom); expected should show removals of 7-patterns creating gaps, then falls resulting in staggered stacks (e.g., 3's in col 1 spreading, 9's in col 10 isolated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No truly helpful functions from this attempt; the preprocess is broken (incorrectly zeros long sequences of c and merges singles oddly, e.g., in Train 1 it removes most c=9 but leaves junk; doesn't handle horizontal connections).
# one_pass_gravity is partially useful for basic falling but incomplete (single pass doesn't fully drop multi-level; better to collect non-zeros per column and restack from bottom).
```

```python
# Potential helpful stub for future: extract connected components per color (not in attempt, but needed based on expectations).
def extract_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Find connected (horizontal/vertical) groups of color, return as lists of positions.
    # Useful for identifying removable patterns (e.g., singles or small groups of c).
    visited = [[False]*12 for _ in range(12)]
    groups = []
    for i in range(12):
        for j in range(12):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j]:
                group = []
                # DFS/BFS to find connected component
                # ...
                groups.append(group)
    return groups
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed, with generated outputs consistently piling most blocks at the bottom (rows 8-11) in dense, incorrect formations, while expected outputs have sparse, distributed stacking with specific gaps and isolated top-left c blocks at bottom-left.
 * Train 1: Generated has empty top 7 rows, then mismatched bottom: e.g., row 8 has 5,1's scattered; row 11 has 9 misplaced in col 0 but 4,2's,7's wrong; expected isolates 9 at [0][0], spreads 1's horizontally at row 2 cols 6-9, stacks 5 at col4 rows 3-5, 3's at col3-5 rows 5-8 with gaps, 6's vertical at col2 rows 5-8, 2's horizontal at row 8 cols 2-9 shortened, 7's at col10 rows 5-8/10-11; difference: no removals/gaps preserved, everything over-falls into blob (unknown why preprocess didn't remove more c=9).
 * Train 2: Generated piles at bottom with 2's vertical in col5 rows 4-9, 5's scattered, 8's in col9; expected has 4 isolated at [0][0], 2's vertical col5 rows 4-8, 5's horizontal row5 cols6-8, 8's vertical col9 rows 5-8, 9's vertical col2 rows 6-8, 3's at col10 rows 9-11 with gaps above, 7's scattered; difference: generated merges 5's/7's wrongly at bottom, misses horizontal spreads and upper placements (e.g., 5's should be at row5, not fallen further).
 * Train 3: Generated similar bottom pile: 2's col5, 8's col9-10 with 3/4 mix, 5's scattered; expected isolates 6 at [0][0], 8's vertical col9 rows 2-5, 2's col5 rows 4-8 with 5's horizontal row4 cols6-8, 7's col6 rows 6-8, 3's col10 rows 9-11 gapped, 4's horizontal row8 cols3-5, 9's vertical col2 rows 8-10 gapped below; difference: generated doesn't separate 4's/3's, over-drops everything, c=6 not isolated properly.
 * Train 4: Generated empty top 7 rows, bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8 scattered, 3's col5-6 row9-10, 2's row11 partial; expected has 4 at [0][0], 1's horizontal row6 cols5-8, 5 at col4 rows6-8, 3's col3-5 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols2-9, 7's col10-11 rows9-11 gapped; difference: no upper structures (e.g., 1's should be row6, not row7-8), preprocess fails to remove c=4 patterns correctly.
 * Train 5: Generated bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8, 3's col4-6 row9-10, 2's row11; expected has 7 at [0][0], 5 at col4 rows5-7 isolated, 1's horizontal row7 cols5-8, 3's col2-4 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols1-9; difference: c=7 not isolated, 5's/1's not gapped/upper, everything compacted wrong.
 * Preprocess function is broken/not helpful: incorrectly zeros entire sequences of c longer than 1 and merges singles to above value (e.g., in Train 1, it removes most 9's but leaves artifacts); doesn't detect isolated singles properly (condition "if length==1 and new_g[start-1][j] !=0" is backwards—should remove if no support below?); ignores horizontal connections, treating columns independently.
 * one_pass_gravity is partially helpful for basic drops but insufficient: single bottom-up pass only moves blocks one level per call, requiring n iterations but still fails multi-column interactions or full settling (e.g., in all trains, blocks don't reach exact expected heights/gaps).
 * No extraction of connected objects in attempt, but expectations suggest it's essential to identify removable c-groups (singles or small clusters) before gravity.
 * Overall: Attempts show partial gravity understanding (blocks do fall) but zero grasp of removal rules (no gaps preserved, c not specially handled), leading to over-compacted bottoms; subtle horizontal group preservation missed (e.g., 1's/2's stay horizontal in expected).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows empty top 4 rows, then scattered partial stacks (e.g., 4's vertical col2 rows4-7, 3's col4 rows4-7 and col1 rows9-11, 8's col6 rows5-7, 5's col6-7 row8 and col8 row8? Wait, row8 has 6,5's mixed), bottom row11 with 7,3,1's,5,2's,9 compacted; this over-piles like trains, ignoring gaps.
 * Why not correct: Expected should isolate c (likely 7 from bottom-left? But top-left is unclear in input snippet—assume g[0][0]=7 or similar) at [0][0], create gaps from 7/1 removals (e.g., col0 has 7 at bottom, but input has 7 at row11 col0), then fall others into staggered forms (e.g., 3's in col1/4 should gap like trains, 9 in col10 isolated vertical, 2's horizontal row11 cols6-9, 5's grouped col6-8 row8-10 gapped); generated misses this, compacting everything without preserving structures or upper placements (e.g., no horizontal 1's or separated 8's).
 * To handle test: Need better preprocess to remove isolated 7's/1's (input has 1's at row11 col2-4, likely c-related), full column-restack gravity (collect non-zeros, place from bottom), and detect horizontal connections for non-c groups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 12x12 grid where cells contain integers representing colors (0 for empty), involving simulation of plant-like growth or manipulation rules with vertical "stems" (runs of the same color), horizontal "branches" attaching to them, special handling for a "top_color" (the color at grid[0][0]), removal/extension of elements, downward extension through empty spaces, and gravity to drop non-empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Stems are defined as vertical contiguous runs of the same non-zero color with length >=2 in a column; they are identified from top to bottom, skipping zeros.
 * Branches are horizontal contiguous runs of the same color (length >=2) adjacent (left or right) to a stem cell, but only if the branch color differs from the stem color; branches are checked only at specific positions relative to the stem (e.g., at the stem's start row or one row above, via delta [0, -1]).
 * Actions on branches: If branch color matches top_color, remove the entire branch (set to 0); otherwise, clear the branch, optionally clear the attachment point on the stem if it's a "cap end" (when checked at delta=-1, possibly indicating a top-attached branch), extend the stem downward by the stem's length (clamping to grid bottom), and relocate the branch to the new stem end row.
 * After all actions, remove any remaining vertical stems of top_color (length >=2) entirely.
 * Extend all remaining non-zero vertical runs downward by filling contiguous zeros below them with the same color (but do not create new stems).
 * Apply gravity per column: Collect non-zero cells and place them at the bottom of the column, filling top with zeros.
 * Subtleties: Top_color is always g[0][0] at start, suggesting it's a fixed "special" color (e.g., for removal). Branch detection scans left/right from attachment to find full run extents. Stem extension in non-remove actions uses the original stem length, potentially over-extending or clamping at row 11. "Cap end" logic may handle branches at the top of stems differently (e.g., not preserving stem attachment). The code mutates a copy of the grid. Potential misses: No handling for branches overlapping multiple stems, no diagonal or multi-color interactions, assumes integer colors >=1, no validation for grid size, and actions are applied in order without re-checking (possible overlaps). In removal of top_color stems post-actions, it only targets exact top_color runs, skipping others. Gravity is bottom-aligned, standard drop physics.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    branch_r = start_r + delta
    if branch_r < 0:
        continue
    if g[branch_r][col] != color:  # Attachment must be on stem color? Wait, code checks != color for branch, but attachment is on stem.

            g[r][col] = non_zero[r - (12 - len(non_zero))]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) identifies stems and branches correctly in structure but fails to execute due to a KeyError: 'stem_color' (the action dict in branches lacks 'stem_color': color when appending, but later code tries to access action['stem_color'] during stem extension in non-remove actions; also, a pass statement skips handling stem start for top_color, marked as "to be fixed").
 * No outputs generated for any training example or test input, so nothing worked in terms of producing grids; all attempts crash immediately on execution.
 * Stem and branch detection loops are logically sound and would work if isolated (e.g., they correctly find runs >=2), but integration into actions is broken.
 * Action application logic partially captures rules (remove top_color branches/stems, extend others down by stem length, cap-end clearing), but untested due to crash; subtle bug in non-remove: it clears branch twice (redundant loop) and sets g[new_r][c] = b_color for the whole branch row, but doesn't preserve order or handle if new_r overlaps existing cells.
 * Post-processing (remove top_color, extend, gravity) is implemented helpfully and would run if actions succeeded, but skips re-extending cleared stems.
 * No handling for cases where branches attach to extended stems or multiple actions per stem; assumes single attachment per delta/side.
 * The code mutates a grid copy (good), but lacks error handling or validation (e.g., if no top_color).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training examples) is an ERROR - Execution error: 'stem_color', so it does not look correct or produce any grid; this prevents verifying if the logic matches expected puzzle outcomes (e.g., no way to see if stems extend properly, branches relocate, or gravity applies as intended).
 * Without generated grids, cannot compare to mentally simulated rules (e.g., for test input, we'd expect specific branch removals if top_color matches, or downward shifts, but error blocks this; difference is total failure vs. any partial grid).
 * To handle test case, must fix dict key omission and test for over-extension (e.g., if stem length pushes new_r >11, clamping occurs but may truncate branches incorrectly).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 21:25:51] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 4 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 5 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 21:26:30] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing images or patterns) that require generating a Python program with a specific 'program' function to analyze and output results based on puzzle rules, such as identifying objects, patterns, or transformations in the grid. The goal is to pass multiple training examples and correctly handle a test input by producing valid outputs that match expected puzzle logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a function named exactly 'program' to be valid; without it, all evaluations fail regardless of other logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves processing grids (e.g., List[List[int]]) to extract or manipulate "objects" like blobs, shapes, or features (e.g., hole counts, connectivity), but rules for what constitutes a correct output (e.g., counting elements, matching patterns) are not yet clear from attempts.
 * Subtle elements may include handling edge cases like disconnected components, varying grid sizes, or specific object criteria (e.g., omitting certain shapes), but these are untested due to structural errors.
 * Outputs should be deterministic and match expected formats (e.g., strings, numbers, or modified grids) for training and test cases; errors suggest the puzzle emphasizes code structure over partial logic.
 * Considerations across attempts: No successful runs mean no insights into grid parsing, object detection, or rule application; future attempts must prioritize the 'program' function wrapper while incorporating grid traversal (e.g., flood fill for objects) and validation against sample expectations.
 * Easy-to-miss: The puzzle may require modular helper functions (e.g., for object extraction) inside or alongside 'program', but the core output is the 'program' function's result on inputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' structure entirely. Potential useful tools for future attempts could include grid parsing utilities, but none were present.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1-5) and the test input failed with the same error: "Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating a complete structural failure—no code was executed or evaluated.
 * Nothing worked: No object extraction, grid processing, or output generation occurred, as the code wasn't valid for the puzzle's evaluation framework.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code format requirements, leading to blanket rejection without revealing any puzzle-specific issues (e.g., no insights into blob shapes, hole counts, or pattern matching).
 * No functions were generated at all, so there are no helpful or unhelpful ones to note; avoid generating raw logic without wrapping it in 'program'.
 * Missed the fundamental requirement of including a callable 'program' function that takes grid inputs and returns puzzle-specific outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no processing of the test input grid occurred.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, no output was generated for the test case, so it cannot match any expected puzzle result (e.g., if the test involves a specific grid pattern, nothing was analyzed).
 * This failure prevents assessing if the logic would handle test subtleties like unique object configurations or edge grids; it simply confirms the code is unusable.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 21:26:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle task where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a required 'program' function that correctly processes grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) to produce expected outputs for multiple training examples and a test input. The previous attempt failed entirely due to the absence of the core 'program' function, resulting in uniform errors across all evaluations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of other logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid structures (e.g., List[List[int]]) to extract or manipulate visual elements like blobs, objects, holes, or patterns, then outputting results that match expected behaviors for training and test cases.
 * Training examples (1-5) and test input must all pass validation; partial success on some isn't enough—full coverage is required, including handling edge cases like varying grid sizes or object configurations.
 * Subtle elements include ensuring the code is syntactically valid Python, handles input formats precisely (e.g., 2D lists), and produces outputs that align with puzzle rules (e.g., identifying/omitting specific objects based on properties like connectivity or counts).
 * Consider grid traversal techniques (e.g., flood fill for connected components) to detect objects, as visual puzzles often require identifying discrete elements amid noise or overlaps.
 * Outputs should be deterministic and exact matches; any deviation (e.g., wrong object counts or missed patterns) causes failure.
 * No modifications to input formats allowed—code must adapt to given grids without assumptions about dimensions or values.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were present in the previous attempt, as the code lacked even basic structure. Future attempts should include utilities like grid parsing or object detection, e.g.:

```python
from typing import List

def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Example: Flood fill to extract blob positions (helpful for visual object identification)
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in grid]
    components = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][y] != 0 and not visited[x][y]:
                        visited[x][y] = True
                        component.append((x, y))
                        stack.extend([(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)])
                components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def count_holes_in_object(component: List[tuple[int, int]], grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Example: Detect enclosed spaces (holes) within a connected object; useful for puzzles with topology
    # Implementation would involve boundary tracing or parity checks—placeholder for now
    return 0  # To be fleshed out based on puzzle rules
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt generated code without any 'program' function, leading to immediate errors on all training examples (1-5) and the test input.
 * Nothing worked: No valid code structure, no object extraction, no grid processing—complete failure to meet basic requirements.
 * All outputs were identical errors ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), indicating zero progress toward puzzle solving.
 * No helpful functions were included; any potential code snippets (if present) were irrelevant or broken due to the missing core function.
 * This attempt demonstrates no understanding of the puzzle, as it didn't even attempt to define the required function or handle grid inputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates a fundamental structural failure rather than any puzzle-specific result.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, so it cannot match expected puzzle rules (e.g., identifying objects or patterns in the grid); this is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, the test case couldn't be evaluated, missing any opportunity to verify against puzzle expectations like object counts or configurations.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing images or patterns) that require generating a Python program with a specific 'program' function to analyze and output results based on puzzle rules, such as identifying objects, patterns, or transformations in the grid. The goal is to pass multiple training examples and correctly handle a test input by producing valid outputs that match expected puzzle logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a function named exactly 'program' to be valid; without it, all evaluations fail regardless of other logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves processing grids (e.g., List[List[int]]) to extract or manipulate "objects" like blobs, shapes, or features (e.g., hole counts, connectivity), but rules for what constitutes a correct output (e.g., counting elements, matching patterns) are not yet clear from attempts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 12x12 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-9 represent colors, 0 is empty space) where a specific color c (determined by the top-left non-empty cell g[0][0]) triggers preprocessing to identify and remove or merge certain patterns of that color (likely isolated singles or short sequences not connected to larger groups), followed by gravity simulation to make blocks fall downward into empty spaces, resulting in restacked formations that match expected layouts with specific separations and positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires identifying the "special" color c from g[0][0], which seems to be the trigger for removal rules—only patterns of c are affected in preprocessing, while other colors fall normally.
 * Preprocessing likely removes isolated single blocks of c (length==1 sequences not adjacent to non-zero above) or short unconnected sequences, but merges or propagates if connected; however, the code's logic for this is flawed, as it incorrectly sets singles to the value above or zeros out longer groups indiscriminately.
 * Gravity must fully settle blocks column-by-column, but the one_pass_gravity function only does adjacent swaps in a single bottom-up pass per iteration, which fails to propagate falls fully (e.g., a block needs multiple swaps to reach the bottom if there are multiple empties below); applying it n times helps but isn't efficient or correct for multi-level drops.
 * Expected outputs show "objects" or connected groups (horizontal/vertical runs of same color) falling as units but separating into distinct stacks per column, with some colors (like c) partially removed or not falling fully, leading to gaps and specific heights (e.g., in Train 1, 1's form a horizontal line at row 2, but 5 is stacked below in col 4; 3's in col 3-5 at varying heights).
 * Subtlety: Removals happen before gravity, and only affect c—other colors remain intact but fall around the gaps; connected components of non-c may need to be treated as rigid or fall individually.
 * Blocks don't rotate or connect diagonally; falls are strictly vertical per column, but initial positions suggest horizontal connections influence removal (e.g., in Train 1 expected, the bottom row of 2's is shortened and isolated, 7's stacked in col 10-11).
 * Easy to miss: The top-left c block itself often ends up isolated at the bottom-left of its column in expected outputs (e.g., 9 in Train 1 col 0 row 0; 4 in Train 2 col 0 row 0), suggesting c's group is partially preserved or the rest removed.
 * Across attempts, no matching of group shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated piles all at bottom row 8-11, but expected has distributed heights like row 0 for 9, row 5-8 for 6's/3's); empties persist in specific patterns post-fall.
 * Test input considerations: Involves colors like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with c likely 7 (top-left? Wait, test input starts at bottom? Grids are row 0 top to row 11 bottom); expected should show removals of 7-patterns creating gaps, then falls resulting in staggered stacks (e.g., 3's in col 1 spreading, 9's in col 10 isolated).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No truly helpful functions from this attempt; the preprocess is broken (incorrectly zeros long sequences of c and merges singles oddly, e.g., in Train 1 it removes most c=9 but leaves junk; doesn't handle horizontal connections).
# one_pass_gravity is partially useful for basic falling but incomplete (single pass doesn't fully drop multi-level; better to collect non-zeros per column and restack from bottom).
```

```python
# Potential helpful stub for future: extract connected components per color (not in attempt, but needed based on expectations).
def extract_groups(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Find connected (horizontal/vertical) groups of color, return as lists of positions.
    # Useful for identifying removable patterns (e.g., singles or small groups of c).
    visited = [[False]*12 for _ in range(12)]
    groups = []
    for i in range(12):
        for j in range(12):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j]:
                group = []
                # DFS/BFS to find connected component
                # ...
                groups.append(group)
    return groups
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed, with generated outputs consistently piling most blocks at the bottom (rows 8-11) in dense, incorrect formations, while expected outputs have sparse, distributed stacking with specific gaps and isolated top-left c blocks at bottom-left.
 * Train 1: Generated has empty top 7 rows, then mismatched bottom: e.g., row 8 has 5,1's scattered; row 11 has 9 misplaced in col 0 but 4,2's,7's wrong; expected isolates 9 at [0][0], spreads 1's horizontally at row 2 cols 6-9, stacks 5 at col4 rows 3-5, 3's at col3-5 rows 5-8 with gaps, 6's vertical at col2 rows 5-8, 2's horizontal at row 8 cols 2-9 shortened, 7's at col10 rows 5-8/10-11; difference: no removals/gaps preserved, everything over-falls into blob (unknown why preprocess didn't remove more c=9).
 * Train 2: Generated piles at bottom with 2's vertical in col5 rows 4-9, 5's scattered, 8's in col9; expected has 4 isolated at [0][0], 2's vertical col5 rows 4-8, 5's horizontal row5 cols6-8, 8's vertical col9 rows 5-8, 9's vertical col2 rows 6-8, 3's at col10 rows 9-11 with gaps above, 7's scattered; difference: generated merges 5's/7's wrongly at bottom, misses horizontal spreads and upper placements (e.g., 5's should be at row5, not fallen further).
 * Train 3: Generated similar bottom pile: 2's col5, 8's col9-10 with 3/4 mix, 5's scattered; expected isolates 6 at [0][0], 8's vertical col9 rows 2-5, 2's col5 rows 4-8 with 5's horizontal row4 cols6-8, 7's col6 rows 6-8, 3's col10 rows 9-11 gapped, 4's horizontal row8 cols3-5, 9's vertical col2 rows 8-10 gapped below; difference: generated doesn't separate 4's/3's, over-drops everything, c=6 not isolated properly.
 * Train 4: Generated empty top 7 rows, bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8 scattered, 3's col5-6 row9-10, 2's row11 partial; expected has 4 at [0][0], 1's horizontal row6 cols5-8, 5 at col4 rows6-8, 3's col3-5 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols2-9, 7's col10-11 rows9-11 gapped; difference: no upper structures (e.g., 1's should be row6, not row7-8), preprocess fails to remove c=4 patterns correctly.
 * Train 5: Generated bottom pile with 5,1's row7-8, 3's col4-6 row9-10, 2's row11; expected has 7 at [0][0], 5 at col4 rows5-7 isolated, 1's horizontal row7 cols5-8, 3's col2-4 row8-11 gapped, 6's col2 rows8-10 gapped, 2's row11 cols1-9; difference: c=7 not isolated, 5's/1's not gapped/upper, everything compacted wrong.
 * Preprocess function is broken/not helpful: incorrectly zeros entire sequences of c longer than 1 and merges singles to above value (e.g., in Train 1, it removes most 9's but leaves artifacts); doesn't detect isolated singles properly (condition "if length==1 and new_g[start-1][j] !=0" is backwards—should remove if no support below?); ignores horizontal connections, treating columns independently.
 * one_pass_gravity is partially helpful for basic drops but insufficient: single bottom-up pass only moves blocks one level per call, requiring n iterations but still fails multi-column interactions or full settling (e.g., in all trains, blocks don't reach exact expected heights/gaps).
 * No extraction of connected objects in attempt, but expectations suggest it's essential to identify removable c-groups (singles or small clusters) before gravity.
 * Overall: Attempts show partial gravity understanding (blocks do fall) but zero grasp of removal rules (no gaps preserved, c not specially handled), leading to over-compacted bottoms; subtle horizontal group preservation missed (e.g., 1's/2's stay horizontal in expected).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows empty top 4 rows, then scattered partial stacks (e.g., 4's vertical col2 rows4-7, 3's col4 rows4-7 and col1 rows9-11, 8's col6 rows5-7, 5's col6-7 row8 and col8 row8? Wait, row8 has 6,5's mixed), bottom row11 with 7,3,1's,5,2's,9 compacted; this over-piles like trains, ignoring gaps.
 * Why not correct: Expected should isolate c (likely 7 from bottom-left? But top-left is unclear in input snippet—assume g[0][0]=7 or similar) at [0][0], create gaps from 7/1 removals (e.g., col0 has 7 at bottom, but input has 7 at row11 col0), then fall others into staggered forms (e.g., 3's in col1/4 should gap like trains, 9 in col10 isolated vertical, 2's horizontal row11 cols6-9, 5's grouped col6-8 row8-10 gapped); generated misses this, compacting everything without preserving structures or upper placements (e.g., no horizontal 1's or separated 8's).
 * To handle test: Need better preprocess to remove isolated 7's/1's (input has 1's at row11 col2-4, likely c-related), full column-restack gravity (collect non-zeros, place from bottom), and detect horizontal connections for non-c groups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 12x12 grid where cells contain integers representing colors (0 for empty), involving simulation of plant-like growth or manipulation rules with vertical "stems" (runs of the same color), horizontal "branches" attaching to them, special handling for a "top_color" (the color at grid[0][0]), removal/extension of elements, downward extension through empty spaces, and gravity to drop non-empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Stems are defined as vertical contiguous runs of the same non-zero color with length >=2 in a column; they are identified from top to bottom, skipping zeros.
 * Branches are horizontal contiguous runs of the same color (length >=2) adjacent (left or right) to a stem cell, but only if the branch color differs from the stem color; branches are checked only at specific positions relative to the stem (e.g., at the stem's start row or one row above, via delta [0, -1]).
 * Actions on branches: If branch color matches top_color, remove the entire branch (set to 0); otherwise, clear the branch, optionally clear the attachment point on the stem if it's a "cap end" (when checked at delta=-1, possibly indicating a top-attached branch), extend the stem downward by the stem's length (clamping to grid bottom), and relocate the branch to the new stem end row.
 * After all actions, remove any remaining vertical stems of top_color (length >=2) entirely.
 * Extend all remaining non-zero vertical runs downward by filling contiguous zeros below them with the same color (but do not create new stems).
 * Apply gravity per column: Collect non-zero cells and place them at the bottom of the column, filling top with zeros.
 * Subtleties: Top_color is always g[0][0] at start, suggesting it's a fixed "special" color (e.g., for removal). Branch detection scans left/right from attachment to find full run extents. Stem extension in non-remove actions uses the original stem length, potentially over-extending or clamping at row 11. "Cap end" logic may handle branches at the top of stems differently (e.g., not preserving stem attachment). The code mutates a copy of the grid. Potential misses: No handling for branches overlapping multiple stems, no diagonal or multi-color interactions, assumes integer colors >=1, no validation for grid size, and actions are applied in order without re-checking (possible overlaps). In removal of top_color stems post-actions, it only targets exact top_color runs, skipping others. Gravity is bottom-aligned, standard drop physics.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Stem extraction: Identifies vertical stems as dicts with col, start/end rows, color, length.

    branch_r = start_r + delta
    if branch_r < 0:
        continue

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) identifies stems and branches correctly in structure but fails to execute due to a KeyError: 'stem_color' (the action dict in branches lacks 'stem_color': color when appending, but later code tries to access action['stem_color'] during stem extension in non-remove actions; also, a pass statement skips handling stem start for top_color, marked as "to be fixed").
 * No outputs generated for any training example or test input, so nothing worked in terms of producing grids; all attempts crash immediately on execution.
 * Stem and branch detection loops are logically sound and would work if isolated (e.g., they correctly find runs >=2), but integration into actions is broken.
 * Action application logic partially captures rules (remove top_color branches/stems, extend others down by stem length, cap-end clearing), but untested due to crash; subtle bug in non-remove: it clears branch twice (redundant loop) and sets g[new_r][c] = b_color for the whole branch row, but doesn't preserve order or handle if new_r overlaps existing cells.
 * Post-processing (remove top_color, extend, gravity) is implemented helpfully and would run if actions succeeded, but skips re-extending cleared stems.
 * No handling for cases where branches attach to extended stems or multiple actions per stem; assumes single attachment per delta/side.
 * The code mutates a grid copy (good), but lacks error handling or validation (e.g., if no top_color).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training examples) is an ERROR - Execution error: 'stem_color', so it does not look correct or produce any grid; this prevents verifying if the logic matches expected puzzle outcomes (e.g., no way to see if stems extend properly, branches relocate, or gravity applies as intended).
 * Without generated grids, cannot compare to mentally simulated rules (e.g., for test input, we'd expect specific branch removals if top_color matches, or downward shifts, but error blocks this; difference is total failure vs. any partial grid).
 * To handle test case, must fix dict key omission and test for over-extension (e.g., if stem length pushes new_r >11, clamping occurs but may truncate branches incorrectly).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 21:54:52] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 4 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 5 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 21:55:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle task requiring the generation of Python code containing a specific 'program' function that processes input grids (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like objects, blobs, or patterns) to produce correct outputs based on puzzle rules, such as extracting or manipulating elements while matching training examples. The goal is to solve for a test input grid by ensuring the code handles rules like object detection, counting features (e.g., holes), or pattern matching without errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a 'program' function exactly, as its absence causes immediate evaluation errors across all examples— this is a non-negotiable structural requirement.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid-based inputs (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual scenes with objects, where rules may include identifying blobs, counting holes or components, omitting certain elements based on criteria, or ensuring shapes match exactly.
 * Subtle elements: Handle cases where objects don't span the full grid (e.g., partial or irregular shapes); account for dividers, bars, or separators in patterns; ensure exact matching of output shapes or values without extra/missing elements; consider unknown mismatches in blob extraction or feature counting that could arise from edge cases like isolated pixels or non-connected components.
 * All considerations: Code must pass multiple training examples before tackling the test; mentally simulate rules on test grid (e.g., identify key objects, apply transformations like stretching or omission); avoid generating incomplete code; include helper functions for extraction but ensure they feed into 'program'; watch for errors in object connectivity or feature detection that differ from expected outputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as the code lacked even the basic 'program' structure—future attempts should start with a skeleton 'program' function and add grid-processing helpers like flood-fill for blobs or counters for holes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1-5) failed due to missing 'program' function, indicating a complete structural oversight—no code execution possible.
 * Test input also failed identically, showing no progress toward puzzle solution.
 * No object extraction or processing logic was present, so nothing worked; the attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the need for a functional code base.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid, but the lack of any code highlights the need to prioritize basic scaffolding over puzzle logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates the code is invalid and cannot be evaluated, missing any actual puzzle processing or output.
 * No generated output for the test input grid exists to compare against expected rules (e.g., no object extraction, no matching of visual patterns), so it fails to demonstrate any handling of the puzzle's core elements like grid analysis.
 * This error persists across all cases, confirming the attempt did not account for the fundamental requirement of defining 'program', making it impossible to verify if it would handle test-specific subtleties like irregular objects or feature counts.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 21:57:03] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train examples (1-5), only the following connections are obvious, consistent across **every** puzzle, and involve clear interactions or effects between elements. I focused solely on properties like position, color, pixel count, and bbox that demonstrably influence or relate to each other in identical ways in all cases. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated shapes with no changes or effects), inconsistent interactions (e.g., merging only in some cases like train4 but not others), or forced explanations (e.g., unexplainable pixel losses/gains or movement directions) are excluded. Where a transformation cannot be explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Small 1x1 square (at fixed bbox=[0,0,0,0], pixels=1, holes=0) color → overall puzzle transformation**: The color of this fixed-position square consistently determines whether any transformation occurs on other components. In every example, when the color is Light Blue (train1), no changes happen to any other elements (bbox, pixels, positions remain identical). In all other cases (train2-5, with colors Yellow, Pink, Dark Red, Yellow), transformations occur (e.g., movements, removals), but the exact nature of the transformation based on the color is unknown (e.g., it varies by color but always triggers change except for Light Blue). This is the only fully consistent effect-triggering interaction observed across all examples; no other color-property link (e.g., position → color) is consistent.

- **Small 1x1 square position → stability of its own properties**: The bbox=[0,0,0,0] of the small square remains unchanged in every input-output pair, unaffected by any transformations elsewhere. Its pixels=1 and holes=0 are also invariant. This is a self-contained positional stability, but it indirectly connects to the above by serving as the "anchor" that enables color-based effects on the rest of the puzzle without itself moving.

No other interactions (e.g., shape-to-shape like vertical rectangles affecting horizontal Red bbox, or hole count influencing anything, or consistent color-to-position effects beyond the small square) are obvious and present in **every** example. For instance:
- Pixel count changes or mergers (e.g., Dark Red in train4) do not occur consistently (absent in train1-3,5).
- Downward bbox shifts (e.g., y-coordinates increasing in train2-5) are consistent only conditionally (not in train1), so excluded.
- Removals of same-color components (e.g., Yellow in train2, Pink in train3) are not consistent (e.g., Yellow remains in train4). The exact transformation mechanism for affected components is unknown.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 22:01:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train examples (1-5), only the following connections are obvious, consistent across **every** puzzle, and involve clear interactions or effects between elements. I focused solely on properties like position, color, pixel count, and bbox that demonstrably influence or relate to each other in identical ways in all cases. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated shapes with no changes or effects), inconsistent interactions (e.g., merging only in some cases like train4 but not others), or forced explanations (e.g., unexplainable pixel losses/gains or movement directions) are excluded. Where a transformation cannot be explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Small 1x1 square (at fixed bbox=[0,0,0,0], pixels=1, holes=0) color → overall puzzle transformation**: The color of this fixed-position square consistently determines whether any transformation occurs on other components. In every example, when the color is Light Blue (train1), no changes happen to any other elements (bbox, pixels, positions remain identical). In all other cases (train2-5, with colors Yellow, Pink, Dark Red, Yellow), transformations occur (e.g., movements, removals), but the exact nature of the transformation based on the color is unknown (e.g., it varies by color but always triggers change except for Light Blue). This is the only fully consistent effect-triggering interaction observed across all examples; no other color-property link (e.g., position → color) is consistent.

- **Small 1x1 square position → stability of its own properties**: The bbox=[0,0,0,0] of the small square remains unchanged in every input-output pair, unaffected by any transformations elsewhere. Its pixels=1 and holes=0 are also invariant. This is a self-contained positional stability, but it indirectly connects to the above by serving as the "anchor" that enables color-based effects on the rest of the puzzle without itself moving.

No other interactions (e.g., shape-to-shape like vertical rectangles affecting horizontal Red bbox, or hole count influencing anything, or consistent color-to-position effects beyond the small square) are obvious and present in **every** example. For instance:
- Pixel count changes or mergers (e.g., Dark Red in train4) do not occur consistently (absent in train1-3,5).
- Downward bbox shifts (e.g., y-coordinates increasing in train2-5) are consistent only conditionally (not in train1), so excluded.
- Removals of same-color components (e.g., Yellow in train2, Pink in train3) are not consistent (e.g., Yellow remains in train4). The exact transformation mechanism for affected components is unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def is_light_blue(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return g[0][0] == 9

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

def remove_other_instances(g: List[List[int]], c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    new_g = deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(new_g)):
        for col in range(len(new_g[r])):
            if r == 0 and col == 0:
                continue
            if new_g[r][col] == c:
                new_g[r][col] = 0
    return new_g

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:27:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (12x12, with numbers representing colors or tiles, 0 for empty) where the top-left cell's color (c = g[0][0]) triggers a transformation: if c is 9 (light blue), the grid is unchanged; otherwise, all other instances of c are removed (keeping the top-left one), and the remaining tiles then fall downward due to gravity, but the fall mechanics appear to be column-specific stacking from the bottom rather than a uniform shift. The goal is to produce the exact expected grid after this operation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The removal is specific: only other instances of c (not the top-left one) are cleared to 0, preserving the selected tile at [0][0] unless it's 9, in which case nothing happens.
 * Falling is not a simple uniform downward shift for all tiles; instead, it simulates gravity per column—tiles drop independently in their column to fill gaps below them, stacking from the bottom up without overlapping or shifting sideways. This is a key subtlety missed in the attempt, leading to incorrect positions (e.g., tiles floating or over-shifting).
 * Distance of fall is not hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for 4, 2 for 6); it varies dynamically based on the number of empty spaces created in each column after removal, and tiles only fall as far as needed to settle.
 * Special case for c=9: No removal or falling occurs, grid is copied as-is—this works correctly in the attempt.
 * Grids are oriented with row 0 as the top (tiles fall toward higher row indices, i.e., bottom of the list).
 * No rotation, mirroring, or color changes; only removal and vertical falling in columns.
 * Subtle: After falling, tiles from higher rows (top) may end up higher in the final grid if lower tiles are removed, but the top-left c stays at [0][0] and doesn't fall. Ensure no tiles pass through each other or leave gaps mid-column.
 * Edge cases: Columns with no gaps don't change; full removals cause upper tiles to fall all the way to the bottom; the top-left c might block or anchor falling in col 0.
 * All training examples (except 1) show mismatches in fall distances and per-column stacking, e.g., groups of same-color tiles (like 5's or 7's) should remain grouped if not removed, but fall together.
 * Test input considerations: c=7 at [5][0] (but program takes [0][0], which is 0? Wait, test grid starts with empties at top, so [0][0]=0, but program would treat as default no fall—need to clarify if c is always non-zero or find the "selected" tile differently).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def is_light_blue(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return g[0][0] == 9  # Correctly handles the no-op case for color 9.
```

```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)  # Essential for safe grid manipulation without side effects.
```

```python
def remove_other_instances(g: List[List[int]], c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    new_g = deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(new_g)):
        for col in range(len(new_g[r])):
            if r == 0 and col == 0:
                continue  # Preserves top-left instance correctly.
            if new_g[r][col] == c:
                new_g[r][col] = 0
    return new_g  # Helpful for the removal step; works as intended but needs pairing with proper gravity.
```

```python
# Note: fall_by_distance and get_fall_distance are unhelpful/broken—they apply a uniform shift across the entire grid, ignoring per-column gravity and obstacles/gaps. Do not use in future; replace with column-wise simulation where each non-zero tile drops to the lowest available row in its column.
def fall_by_distance(g: List[List[int]], d: int) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: uniform shift causes overlaps/floaters.
    new_g = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]
    for r in range(12):
        for col in range(12):
            if g[r][col] != 0:
                new_r = r + d
                if new_r < 12:
                    new_g[new_r][col] = g[r][col]
    return new_g  # Results in incorrect positions, e.g., tiles not stacking from bottom.

def get_fall_distance(c: int) -> int:  # Broken: hardcoded distances don't match dynamic gaps; guess for 2 is arbitrary and wrong.
    if c == 4:
        return 3
    if c == 6:
        return 2
    if c == 7:
        return 5
    if c == 2:
        return 3  # guess for test
    return 0  # default no fall
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, likely because it involved c=9 (no-op) or a simple case where uniform fall by d coincidentally matched per-column gravity.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated has 4 fallen to row 3 col 0 (uniform shift), but expected keeps it at row 0 col 0; lower sections show 9's at rows 6-8 col 2 and scattered 2's/8's, but expected has 9's repositioned (e.g., row 6 col 2), 2's grouped differently at rows 5-9 col 5, and 7's at row 8 col 6 with 5's fallen into row 9-10; also, row 9-11 expected has 6 at row 9 col 1, 5's scattered, but generated empties most of it—difference due to uniform fall not simulating column gaps (unknown why 5's didn't group in generated).
 * Training example 3 incorrect: Generated shifts 6 to row 2 col 0 and 4's/5's oddly (e.g., 4's at row 8 col 3, 5's at row 11 col 2-3), but expected keeps 6 at row 0, has 8's fallen to rows 2-3 col 9, 7's grouped at row 6 col 5 and row 9 col 6, 4's at row 8 col 3-5, and 5's/1's scattered lower with empties above—mismatch from uniform shift creating floaters (e.g., 9's not falling into gaps) and wrong distances.
 * Training example 4 incorrect: Generated falls 4 to row 3 col 0 (wrong, expected row 0), 5's/1's shifted uniformly to rows 5-7 col 4-8 leaving gaps, 6's/3's/7's misplaced (e.g., 7's not grouped at row 9 col 9-10), but expected has no fall for upper empties, 5's/1's same positions, 6's/3's same, and 7's grouped at row 9 col 9-10 with 2's row at bottom unchanged—shows uniform fall ignores no-gap columns and over-shifts removed areas.
 * Training example 5 incorrect: Generated falls 7 to row 5 col 0 (wrong, expected row 0), empties most lower grid with partial 5's/1's/3's scattered (e.g., 6's at row 10 col 2, 5's at row 11 col 7), but expected keeps 7 at row 0, falls 5's/1's down (e.g., 1's to row 7 col 5-8, 4 at row 9 col 1, 6/3's adjusted with 2's at bottom)—major difference in per-column stacking, e.g., 5's should drop 2-3 rows in col 4 but stay grouped.
 * Overall, removal step works (preserves top-left), but fall is fundamentally broken (uniform vs. per-column); hardcoded distances fail for varying gap sizes; no function to simulate gravity per column (e.g., collect non-zeros per col and re-place from bottom).
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for identifying groups (e.g., connected same-color tiles) if puzzle involves matching beyond single color removal—however, examples suggest simple color removal, not blob extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It applies a default no-fall (since [0][0]=0, c=0, d=0) but somehow shifts things (wait, program would copy after removal, but with c=0 removes nothing? Inconsistency—perhaps bug in running, but output shows 7 fallen to row 5 col 0 (from original row 0? Test grid not fully shown, but assumes original has 7 higher), 4/3's partially fallen to rows 7-10 col 2-4 with gaps, and 6/5's at bottom row 11 scattered. This doesn't make sense for gravity: if c=7 (but [0][0] empty, so maybe select first non-empty?), other 7's should be removed, then tiles in col 0 (7 stays? but falls?), col 2 (4/3's should stack at bottom without gaps, e.g., 4 then 3's together), col 6 (8's should fall to bottom), col 2-6 (5's should group and fall fully). Instead, floaters/gaps remain (e.g., empties above 4/3's), and bottom row has scattered 6/5's not stacked per column—likely wrong because no per-column gravity simulation, and c detection may fail if top-left empty (subtle: puzzle might select the "active" color differently, e.g., the one "selected" in puzzle context, not strictly [0][0]).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 22:27:43] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 22:31:30] Response:
### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **all** provided figures (train inputs, train outputs, and test inputs). Only properties and components with clear, consistent relationships in every example are included. No assumptions are made about unobservable semantics, transformations, or causes. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., pixel count changes, color-specific removals, or exact shift distances) are noted as such but not forced into connections. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated color occurrences without positional ties) are excluded.

1. **Top-left single-pixel component position and structure interact with overall canvas positioning**:
   - A 1-pixel component (bbox=[0,0,0,0], holes=0, pixels=1) is consistently present at the top-left corner in every figure, serving as a fixed anchor point relative to the uniform black background.
   - Its position does not change relative to the canvas in any train input-output pair, indicating no interaction with downward or lateral movements of other components.
   - Color varies (e.g., Light Blue, Yellow, Pink, Dark Red, Red) but remains unchanged within each train input-output pair, suggesting color stability tied to this fixed position.

2. **Vertical position (y-coordinates in bbox) interacts with component movement or stability**:
   - Components with lower y-coordinates (e.g., bottom-row elements like horizontal bars at y=8 or y=9-11 or vertical extensions spanning y=8-11) consistently exhibit greater stability, with minimal or no bbox changes in train outputs compared to upper components.
   - Upper components (e.g., those with y starting at 2-6) show consistent downward y-shifts in bbox in train outputs where changes occur (e.g., from y=2 to y=4-5 or y=5 to y=7-8), indicating a vertical positional dependency that affects transformation directionally (downward only, never upward or lateral alone).
   - This interaction is consistent but amount of shift is unknown/inconsistent (varies 2-5 units, or 0 in stable cases like train1); no horizontal x-shifts occur in isolation.

3. **Adjacency (bbox overlap or edge-sharing) interacts with same-color merging**:
   - When two or more same-color components become adjacent vertically after positional changes (e.g., one dropping to touch another), they merge into a single component with combined pixels in train outputs (e.g., two Dark Red components, pixels=3+4=7, merge into one bbox=[9,8,10,11] in train4 output).
   - This only occurs for same-color pairs and is consistent where adjacency happens post-movement; no cross-color merging observed in any figure.
   - Non-adjacent same-color components remain separate (e.g., multiple Yellow or Red components stay distinct if bboxes do not touch).

4. **Holes property interacts with shape integrity**:
   - All components across every figure have holes=0, consistently indicating no internal voids or enclosures that affect movement, merging, or positioning (no examples of holes influencing other properties).

5. **Pixel count interacts with bbox dimensions**:
   - Pixel count is consistently tied to bbox size for each component (e.g., pixels=1 always bbox size 1x1; pixels=3-4 often 1x3/3x1 or L-shapes; pixels=5-8 for larger polyominoes spanning 2-4 cells wide/tall).
   - This holds without exception, suggesting shape density (pixels filling bbox without gaps) as a fixed property not affected by color or position, but altered only via merging (as in #3).

### Notes on Unknown/Inconsistent Aspects
- Pixel totals are not conserved between some train inputs and outputs (e.g., decreases of 3-7 pixels in train2,3,5), indicating possible removal or absorption not tied to any consistent interaction (cannot explain without forcing; no pattern across all).
- Color does not consistently affect movement or removal (e.g., downward shifts happen regardless of color; same-color components sometimes merge, sometimes stay separate, sometimes disappear without adjacency).
- No consistent horizontal (x-coordinate) interactions or transformations observed; all changes are vertical or null.
- Test inputs follow the same structural patterns (e.g., top-left anchor, vertical stacking potential) but include extras (e.g., second 1-pixel in test2), which do not alter the above consistencies.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 22:31:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **all** provided figures (train inputs, train outputs, and test inputs). Only properties and components with clear, consistent relationships in every example are included. No assumptions are made about unobservable semantics, transformations, or causes. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., pixel count changes, color-specific removals, or exact shift distances) are noted as such but not forced into connections. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated color occurrences without positional ties) are excluded.

1. **Top-left single-pixel component position and structure interact with overall canvas positioning**:
   - A 1-pixel component (bbox=[0,0,0,0], holes=0, pixels=1) is consistently present at the top-left corner in every figure, serving as a fixed anchor point relative to the uniform black background.
   - Its position does not change relative to the canvas in any train input-output pair, indicating no interaction with downward or lateral movements of other components.
   - Color varies (e.g., Light Blue, Yellow, Pink, Dark Red, Red) but remains unchanged within each train input-output pair, suggesting color stability tied to this fixed position.

2. **Vertical position (y-coordinates in bbox) interacts with component movement or stability**:
   - Components with lower y-coordinates (e.g., bottom-row elements like horizontal bars at y=8 or y=9-11 or vertical extensions spanning y=8-11) consistently exhibit greater stability, with minimal or no bbox changes in train outputs compared to upper components.
   - Upper components (e.g., those with y starting at 2-6) show consistent downward y-shifts in bbox in train outputs where changes occur (e.g., from y=2 to y=4-5 or y=5 to y=7-8), indicating a vertical positional dependency that affects transformation directionally (downward only, never upward or lateral alone).
   - This interaction is consistent but amount of shift is unknown/inconsistent (varies 2-5 units, or 0 in stable cases like train1); no horizontal x-shifts occur in isolation.

3. **Adjacency (bbox overlap or edge-sharing) interacts with same-color merging**:
   - When two or more same-color components become adjacent vertically after positional changes (e.g., one dropping to touch another), they merge into a single component with combined pixels in train outputs (e.g., two Dark Red components, pixels=3+4=7, merge into one bbox=[9,8,10,11] in train4 output).
   - This only occurs for same-color pairs and is consistent where adjacency happens post-movement; no cross-color merging observed in any figure.
   - Non-adjacent same-color components remain separate (e.g., multiple Yellow or Red components stay distinct if bboxes do not touch).

4. **Holes property interacts with shape integrity**:
   - All components across every figure have holes=0, consistently indicating no internal voids or enclosures that affect movement, merging, or positioning (no examples of holes influencing other properties).

5. **Pixel count interacts with bbox dimensions**:
   - Pixel count is consistently tied to bbox size for each component (e.g., pixels=1 always bbox size 1x1; pixels=3-4 often 1x3/3x1 or L-shapes; pixels=5-8 for larger polyominoes spanning 2-4 cells wide/tall).
   - This holds without exception, suggesting shape density (pixels filling bbox without gaps) as a fixed property not affected by color or position, but altered only via merging (as in #3).

### Notes on Unknown/Inconsistent Aspects
- Pixel totals are not conserved between some train inputs and outputs (e.g., decreases of 3-7 pixels in train2,3,5), indicating possible removal or absorption not tied to any consistent interaction (cannot explain without forcing; no pattern across all).
- Color does not consistently affect movement or removal (e.g., downward shifts happen regardless of color; same-color components sometimes merge, sometimes stay separate, sometimes disappear without adjacency).
- No consistent horizontal (x-coordinate) interactions or transformations observed; all changes are vertical or null.
- Test inputs follow the same structural patterns (e.g., top-left anchor, vertical stacking potential) but include extras (e.g., second 1-pixel in test2), which do not alter the above consistencies.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 23:04:43] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def remove_color(g: List[List[int]], c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0 and j == 0:
                continue
            if new_g[i][j] == c:
                new_g[i][j] = 0
    return new_g

def apply_gravity(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    new_g = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for j in range(n):
        non_zeros = [g[i][j] for i in range(n) if g[i][j] != 0]
        start = n - len(non_zeros)
        for i in range(start):
            new_g[i][j] = 0
        for idx, val in enumerate(non_zeros):
            new_g[start + idx][j] = val
    return new_g

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    c = g[0][0]
    g = remove_color(g, c)
    g = apply_gravity(g)
    return g

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

[2025-10-02 23:11:10] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a color block removal puzzle (similar to SameGame or Jawbreaker) on a 12x12 grid, where the goal is to remove a connected group (blob/object) of the same color as the top-left cell [0][0], then apply some form of gravity or collapsing to the remaining blocks, resulting in a restructured grid. The top-left cell itself remains in place at [0][0] with its original color, while other elements shift in a way that preserves some structure but fills certain gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The removal targets only the connected component (4-way or 8-way adjacent cells of the exact same color) containing [0][0], not all cells of that color across the grid—over-removal leads to missing blocks in the output.
 * The top-left cell [0][0] is preserved with its color and stays fixed at its position; it does not participate in any falling or shifting, even if gaps are created below it in its column.
 * Gravity or collapsing is applied per column, but not as a full stack-to-bottom: blocks fall down to fill gaps created by removal, but isolated or separate color groups do not merge or fall past each other, leading to persistent gaps between different-color blobs in the same column (e.g., a group of 5's above a gap, then a 2 below it, without the 5's falling further).
 * Expected outputs consistently show the original top-left color at [0][0] with the rest of row 0 as zeros, multiple empty rows at the top/middle, and remaining blobs shifted downward but retaining their internal shapes and relative separations (suggesting object-aware or partial gravity, not full column compaction).
 * Subtlety: Connected components must be identified via flood fill (BFS/DFS from [0][0]), setting only those cells (except [0][0]) to 0; single-cell groups at [0][0] result in minimal change except potential shifting elsewhere.
 * After removal, shifting seems to occur by bubbling empties upward per column, but only locally (filling immediate gaps without global compaction), preserving "floating" structures if no direct path for falling; this explains gaps between blobs.
 * All examples show no changes to non-removed colors' connectivity, but positions shift downward in affected columns; the overall grid height remains 12x12 with zeros filling unsused spaces.
 * Easy to miss: Direction of row indexing (row 0 as top, gravity downward toward row 11), preservation of blob shapes (no rotation or deformation), and that removal excludes [0][0] explicitly to keep the "marker" visible.
 * Considerations across attempts: No multi-step removal (only one group per run); no matching by size (any connected group qualifies); empties (0) are neutral and do not connect blobs; potential 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right) vs. 8 (diagonals)—examples suggest 4-way based on preserved separations.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set

# Helpful for identifying the connected component to remove (excluding [0][0])
def flood_fill_remove(g: List[List[int]], start: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    c = g[start[0]][start[1]]
    if c == 0:
        return g  # No removal if empty
    visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    stack = [start]
    component = []  # Cells to remove (exclude start)
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        if (i, j) in visited or g[i][j] != c or (i == start[0] and j == start[1]):
            continue
        visited.add((i, j))
        component.append((i, j))
        # 4-way connectivity
        for di, dj in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and (ni, nj) not in visited and g[ni][nj] == c:
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    # Set component cells to 0, keep start intact
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i, j in component:
        new_g[i][j] = 0
    return new_g
```

```python
# The provided apply_gravity stacks all non-zeros at the bottom (correct for full compaction), but is unhelpful here as expected has gaps; replace with gap-filling only
def partial_gravity(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Placeholder for local gap fill (iterate top-to-bottom, shift down if gap below)
    n = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for j in range(n):
        write_idx = 0  # But this would compact fully; need to modify for local shifts or per-blob
        for i in range(n):
            if new_g[i][j] != 0:
                new_g[write_idx][j] = new_g[i][j]
                if write_idx != i:
                    new_g[i][j] = 0
                write_idx += 1
        # This compacts to top actually—wrong direction; adjust for bottom with gaps preserved somehow
    return new_g  # Broken as-is; needs object detection to drop rigid blobs
```

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The provided `remove_color` is broken for this puzzle—it removes all cells of color c except [0][0], ignoring connectivity, leading to over-removal of unrelated blobs (e.g., in train1, unrelated 9's elsewhere removed, causing missing structures like isolated 9's in expected). Do not use in future; replace with flood fill.
The provided `apply_gravity` is unhelpful—it fully compacts non-zeros to the bottom per column, eliminating all gaps, but expected retains gaps between color groups (e.g., train1 column4 has 5/3 group, gap, then 2; train3 column10 has separated 8's and 3's). This causes "stacked" outputs that lose separations. It also moves the preserved [0][0] to the bottom (e.g., 9/4/7/etc. at row11 col0 in all generated), violating the fixed top-left. Do not use; needs revision for partial/local dropping that preserves inter-blob gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies c = g[0][0] and preserves [0][0] initially, but fails by removing all c cells (not connected), leading to excessive zeros and missing expected blobs (e.g., train1 generated lacks the 1's/5's/6's/3's/7's in their expected positions/clusters; instead over-empties top and mis-stacks bottom).
 * Gravity compacts fully to bottom, creating solid stacks without gaps, but expected has intentional gaps between different-color blobs in columns (e.g., train2 column5 stacks 2's then 1 without gap, but generated stacks everything together at bottom; train3 column0 has 6 at bottom but expected has it shifted with gaps).
 * Top-left cell falls to row11 col0 in all generated (e.g., 9 in train1, 4 in train2/train4, 6 in train3, 7 in train5/train test), but expected always keeps it at row0 col0 with row0 rest zeros—unknown why it doesn't fall, but clearly fixed position.
 * All 5 training examples incorrect: generated over-removes (e.g., train5 generated removes all 7's except top-left, but expected retains other 7's? Wait, no—expected has no other 7's visible, but structure differs in 1's/5's/2's positions; differences include misplaced blobs like 2's at bottom-left in generated vs. scattered in expected).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected has horizontal 1's at row2 col5-8 and vertical 5's col4 row2-4, but generated has fragmented 1's/5's at row7-10; unknown if due to over-removal or wrong gravity, but both contribute).
 * Train2 generated keeps/stacks too many cells at bottom (e.g., 5's/7's/3's compacted row6-11), but expected has separated 5's/8's/2's/1's/3's with gaps (e.g., row6:2/5's, gap in row7-8 for some cols, 9's/7's below).
 * Train3 similar: generated fragments 5's/4's/1's at bottom, expected preserves groups like vertical 8's row2-4 col9, horizontal 5's row4 col5-8, with gaps (e.g., column10: 8's high, gap, then 3/4's low).
 * Train4/5 show same over-removal (e.g., train5 generated has 2's/4's/6's/3's/5's/1's stacked bottom, but expected has vertical 5's row6-8 col4, horizontal 1's row8 col5-8, then 3's/5's/2's lower with gaps in col2/6/8).
 * No extraction of objects attempted, but essential for identifying connected groups to remove without affecting others; full compaction ignores blob integrity.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates partial grasp of color removal + shifting, but misses connectivity and gap preservation, causing all mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it mirrors the training generated outputs by stacking all remaining blocks at the bottom (rows 4-11 compacted, top rows 0-3 empty), with the presumed top-left color 7 fallen to row11 col0, and fragmented blobs (e.g., vertical 3's/6's in col1-2 row9-11, horizontal 1's/2's/5's scattered but stacked without gaps).
 * It is incorrect because expected pattern (from training) would keep 7 at row0 col0 with row0 rest zeros, have multiple empty rows, and preserve separated blobs with gaps (e.g., likely a group of 3's/1's high, gap, then 5's/2's/9's lower; here, col0 has only 7 at bottom not top, col6 has 8's then 2's/5's stacked no gap, col10 has 9's stacked with no separation).
 * Does not account for connected removal (likely over-removed unrelated 7's or same-color blobs, missing expected structures like isolated 8's or 9's); gaps absent (e.g., expected probably has empties between 3's group and 5's/2's group in col4/6/7, but output compacts them).
 * Looks like training failures: over-emptied top, misplaced seed cell at bottom, lost blob separations—does not make sense as a valid post-removal state.

[2025-10-02 23:11:23] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all training examples, only the following interaction is obvious, consistent, and present across **every** puzzle (including the no-change case in train 1). All other potential connections (e.g., position shifts, pixel count changes, merging, color propagation, or adjacency-based effects) vary in occurrence, direction, or mechanism and are not consistent in every example. Where no clear explanation exists for a transformation, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Origin component color → removal of matching-color components**:
   - The 1-pixel component at fixed position bbox=[0,0,0,0] (origin pixel, color varies per example: Light Blue in train 1, Yellow in trains 2/4, Pink in train 3, Dark Red in train 5) interacts with all other components sharing its exact color.
   - Effect: All other matching-color components are completely removed (disappear entirely from the output list, with no pixels or bbox retained). Their pixel counts do not transfer or appear in other components.
   - Consistency: This holds in every training example. When matching components exist (trains 2, 3, 4, 5), they are absent in the output. When none exist (train 1), no removal occurs, and the overall composition remains unchanged. No counterexamples or irrelevant elements involved.
   - No holes or other properties factor in (all holes=0 universally, no variation or effect).

No other interactions (e.g., position → position shifts, color → pixel count changes, bbox adjacency → merging, or size → transformation) are consistent across all examples. For instance:
- Position/bbox changes (e.g., y-coordinate increases in trains 2-5) occur in some components but not others, and the pattern (e.g., shift amount, direction, or affected elements) varies unpredictably—mechanism unknown.
- Pixel count preservation or changes (e.g., increase in train 2) is inconsistent and not reliably tied to any property like adjacency or color.
- Merging of same-color components (e.g., train 4) happens in isolated cases but not universally when opportunities exist.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all training examples, only the following interaction is obvious, consistent, and present across **every** puzzle (including the no-change case in train 1). All other potential connections (e.g., position shifts, pixel count changes, merging, color propagation, or adjacency-based effects) vary in occurrence, direction, or mechanism and are not consistent in every example. Where no clear explanation exists for a transformation, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Origin component color → removal of matching-color components**:
   - The 1-pixel component at fixed position bbox=[0,0,0,0] (origin pixel, color varies per example: Light Blue in train 1, Yellow in trains 2/4, Pink in train 3, Dark Red in train 5) interacts with all other components sharing its exact color.
   - Effect: All other matching-color components are completely removed (disappear entirely from the output list, with no pixels or bbox retained). Their pixel counts do not transfer or appear in other components.
   - Consistency: This holds in every training example. When matching components exist (trains 2, 3, 4, 5), they are absent in the output. When none exist (train 1), no removal occurs, and the overall composition remains unchanged. No counterexamples or irrelevant elements involved.
   - No holes or other properties factor in (all holes=0 universally, no variation or effect).

No other interactions (e.g., position → position shifts, color → pixel count changes, bbox adjacency → merging, or size → transformation) are consistent across all examples. For instance:
- Position/bbox changes (e.g., y-coordinate increases in trains 2-5) occur in some components but not others, and the pattern (e.g., shift amount, direction, or affected elements) varies unpredictably—mechanism unknown.
- Pixel count preservation or changes (e.g., increase in train 2) is inconsistent and not reliably tied to any property like adjacency or color.
- Merging of same-color components (e.g., train 4) happens in isolated cases but not universally when opportunities exist.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:30:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 12x12 grid of integers representing colors (0 is empty), where the goal appears to be processing the grid starting from the origin cell at (0,0) by identifying its color and removing disconnected 4-connected components of that color (keeping only the component containing the origin), while potentially applying additional rules to other colors' components, such as removal or relocation of "floating" parts, as evidenced by changes in the expected outputs beyond simple removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The origin color is extracted from grid[0][0]; if 0, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * Connected components are defined using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for cells of the exact same color; diagonal does not count.
 * The current program only removes other components of the origin color, leaving all other colors' components intact, which works when no changes to other colors are needed but fails when expected outputs show removals or relocations in other colors (e.g., isolated blobs of different colors are set to 0 or moved downward).
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often show "floating" components (disconnected from origin or "ground") of non-origin colors being removed or shifted down, suggesting possible gravity simulation (falling into empty spaces below, potentially as rigid same-color components), but counts sometimes appear inconsistent (e.g., extra instances of a color in expected vs. input), which may indicate transcription errors or more complex rules like component merging/stacking upon collision.
 * All processing should use a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the input.
 * Components must be found exhaustively using DFS or BFS (stack used in program is fine), marking visited to avoid re-processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require treating the grid as a side-view "scene" where only "supported" structures (connected to top/origin or bottom via same-color paths) are kept, with unsupported ones removed; relocations in expected suggest simulation of physics-like falling, but order of processing components (e.g., bottom-up or left-to-right) matters to avoid overlaps.
 * Across attempts (this is the first provided, but implies prior iterations), no handling of inter-color connections or gravity, leading to unchanged grids for cases with isolated origin color.
 * Considerations from examples: In cases with isolated origin (no other same-color cells), the program returns the input unchanged, but expected often clears upper rows and repositions lower components; vertical stacks fall variable distances based on gaps below, but horizontal components fall as units; potential collisions between falling components require resolving (e.g., stacking or limiting fall distance).
 * If origin component spans the grid, no removal occurs for that color, but other colors may still need processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly unhelpful in this submission, but the main program function is limited (only handles origin color); extending find_connected_components to all colors without a clear "keep" rule (e.g., connection to origin via any color?) would break it further without gravity simulation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program is the only one shown, but it correctly handles removal of disconnected origin-color components, passing Training example 1 (likely a case with no other colors needing change or isolated origin).
 * Failed Training example 2: Generated keeps all non-origin color components intact (e.g., upper 2's in col5 rows2-3, 5's/8 in row2 col6-9), but expected removes upper isolated parts (rows2-3 all 0s, no 5's/8 in row2) and repositions lower ones (5's/8 moved to row5 attached to 2's, extra 2's appear in col5 row4-8 vs. input's 4 2's there—count mismatch suggests possible error or merging rule); also keeps disconnected 9's/7's/3's/6's/5's/1's unchanged, but expected adjusts 7's positions in row11.
 * Failed Training example 3: Similar to ex2, generated keeps upper 2/5/8/4 components (e.g., 2's col5 rows2-5, 5's row2 col6-8, 4's row6 col3-5), but expected repositions them downward (2's to rows4-7 col5, 5's to row4 col6-8, 8's stay but upper cleared, 4's to row8 col3-5 landing near 5's/1's); removes disconnected lower 6's in col1 rows9-11 (correctly, as program would, but origin is 6 so it does remove them); count for 4's preserved, but 2's fall limited to avoid overlap with falling 4's.
 * Failed Training example 4: Generated keeps upper 5/1 components (rows2-4 col4-8), but expected clears rows2-5 all 0s and repositions 5/1's to rows5-7 (preserving shape, fallen 3 rows to stack on lower structures); lower components (6/3/5/7/2's) kept intact in generated, but expected repositions them downward 3 rows (e.g., 3's to rows8-10, 5's to rows8-10 col7-8, 2's to row11, 6's to rows8-10, 7's stay at bottom); suggests uniform fall distance for mid-level components to stack without overlap.
 * Failed Training example 5: Generated keeps upper/mid 5/1/6/3/5/2/4 components, but expected clears upper/mid rows2-7 all 0s and repositions (5/1's fallen far to rows7-8? Wait, to row7 col4:5/1's partial, but 1's to row7 col8 etc.; 6/3/5 to rows8-10, 2's to row11, 4's stay bottom); origin 7 alone, program keeps all else, but expected removes floating upper parts entirely or repositions lower ones.
 * Overall, program misses removal/relocation of non-origin color components (keeps floating blobs like upper 2/5/8/1's/4's that expected clears or drops); extract_objects-like function (implied by components) is essential for identifying groups but needs extension to all colors and gravity simulation (rigid fall by min gap below component, resolving collisions by limiting distance).
 * In all failing cases, generated = input (since isolated origin color), but expected has upper rows cleared (e.g., rows2-4 often 0s) and mid/lower components shifted down variable distances (1-3 rows, preserving shape/count, stacking adjacent); unknown why fall distances vary (e.g., 2 rows in ex3 for 2's/5's to avoid 4's overlap, 3 rows in ex4 for uniform stacking).
 * Function find_connected_components is correct and helpful for core identification; no broken functions, but main program lacks all-color processing or post-removal gravity.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it appears to be the input grid unchanged (origin 7 at (0,0) likely has no connected other 7's, so program copies grid), keeping all components intact (e.g., upper 4/3's in rows2-5 col2-4, 8's in col6 rows3-5, 6/5's in rows6-8 col2-7, lower 3/1/2/9's in rows9-11).
 * Based on training patterns, correct output should clear upper "floating" components (e.g., set rows2-5 mostly to 0s, remove isolated 4/3/8 groups if disconnected), and reposition mid/lower ones downward (e.g., 6/5's fall 2-3 rows to stack near bottom 1/2/9's, preserving shapes like horizontal 5's or vertical 3's; 8's may stay or fall limited by gaps below).
 * It keeps too much (e.g., upper 4/3 in col2-4 rows2-6, 8's col6 rows3-6 unchanged, but expected likely drops 5's row6-7 col3-7 to lower rows adjacent to 1's/2's in row9-11); count for colors like 3 (appears 4 times input, likely preserved but repositioned); does not account for gravity/collision, leading to no shifts (e.g., lower 3/1 in col1/4 rows9-11 stay, but may stack with fallen upper parts).
 * Unknown exact fall mechanics (rigid vs. per-column, collision resolution), but test keeps floating upper/mid blobs intact, unlike expected in training where they are cleared or dropped.
