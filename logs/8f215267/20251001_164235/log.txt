=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:42:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:59:42] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains scattered non-background colored cells forming rough shapes or objects, and the goal is to clean noise, identify distinct objects (likely connected components of the same color), and transform each sufficiently large object into a standardized rectangular frame using its own color: full top and bottom bars, vertical sides, background-filled interior, and a specific dotted pattern in the third row from the top (positions calculated from the right based on the color value). The output preserves separations via background rows and ensures frames are typically 5 rows high (or adjusted), without merging unrelated objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value in the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all frames respect this by filling interiors and unused areas with it.
 * Pre-process by removing small connected components (same-color, 4-directional connectivity) of size <=5 to eliminate noise like isolated dots or tiny blobs; however, this threshold may be too permissive if small components (>5 cells) bridge separate objects vertically, causing merged blocks.
 * Objects are separate if they are disconnected components of the same color; different colors should not merge even if in consecutive rows without full background rows between them—current row-block approach fails here by treating any non-background in consecutive rows as one block, leading to merged shapes and wrong dominant color selection.
 * For each object, compute bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col); height h = max_row - min_row + 1 must be >=5 and width w = max_col - min_col + 1 >=3 to process; skip smaller ones.
 * Dominant color c is the most frequent non-background color in the object's cells (or the component's color if processing per-component).
 * Frame construction: Set top row (min_row) and bottom row (max_row) fully to c from min_col to max_col; set sides (min_col and max_col) to c on all rows from min_row to max_row; fill interior (rows min_row+1 to max_row-1, cols min_col+1 to max_col-1) with background; do not overwrite other objects.
 * Pattern in middle row = min_row + 2 (third row of frame), only if middle < max_row (i.e., h > 3, but combined with h>=5 check): k = (c + 1) // 2; place c at interior columns col = max_col - 2 * i for i=1 to k, if L < col < R (every other column from the right, up to k positions); this creates denser patterns for higher c (e.g., c=2: 1 dot; c=4: 2 dots; c=8: 4 dots).
 * Special extension rule for last object if h==5, it's the final block (no non-bg below), previous row is all background, and top row is already full c: extend frame upward by 1 row, setting the previous row to full c from L to R, increasing h to 6—but this seems rarely applied in examples and may over-extend if misdetected.
 * Blocks/objects are vertically separated by full background rows; output should maintain these separations without adding or removing them.
 * Process objects independently in bounding boxes to avoid interference; order from top to bottom to handle overlaps (though examples show no overlaps).
 * Subtlety: In some inputs, objects may be vertically stacked closely (no full bg row between), but must remain separate if different colors or disconnected; current approach merges them into tall frames, which is incorrect.
 * Widths vary (e.g., ~11-20 columns in examples), but frames hug the object's extent; right-side pattern placement ensures symmetry or specific alignment, but exact col indexing (0-based vs 1-based) needs verification against examples.
 * All examples show frames exactly 5 rows high (except possible extensions), with patterns only in the third row; tall inputs must be split into multiple 5-row frames if they represent stacked objects.
 * Background fills everything outside frames; no changes to full bg rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The clean_small_components function is helpful for noise removal (removes same-color connected <=5 cells, replacing with bg), but its max_size=5 may need tuning (e.g., to 1-3 for stricter cleaning) or integration with per-color processing to avoid bridging. The has_non_bg_after function is useful for detecting last blocks (for extension rule). The process_shape logic for frame building and pattern placement is mostly correct (dominant c, L/R extent, full top/bottom/sides, interior bg, right-aligned every-other pattern), but must be applied to per-component bounding boxes, not row blocks. The get_background is simple and correct.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The row-block detection in find_and_process_blocks merges vertically adjacent objects of different colors (e.g., 8 and 2 in train1) into one tall block if no full bg row separates them after cleaning, leading to wrong dominant color (picks 2 over 8) and incorrect tall frames (12+ rows instead of separate 5-row frames).
 * Cleaning with max_size=5 removes small noise but leaves larger small components (>5 cells) that bridge blocks, causing extra height (e.g., train2 last 4-block becomes 6 rows instead of 5; train1 second block merges 8 and 2 areas).
 * Dominant color selection works within a block but fails globally because blocks include multiple objects; e.g., in train1, second block picks 2 (more cells?) instead of processing separate 8 and 2 components.
 * Pattern placement and frame structure (full top/bottom, sides, interior bg) are correct when applied (e.g., positions match expected every-other from right; k=(c+1)//2 works for c=2:1 dot at col9; c=4:2 dots; c=8:4 dots at 3,5,7,9), but only applied once per merged block, missing multiple patterns.
 * Extension rule is implemented but not triggered correctly or needed in examples; it over-extends in some cases (e.g., train2 last block) and is skipped when prev row isn't all bg.
 * In train1: Generated correct 5-row 4-frame with no pattern (or minimal), but second "2-frame" is tall (rows7-18, pattern only in row9, sides/full incorrect for 8), third 2 missing entirely; expected separate 5-row 4, 5-row 8 (alternating pattern in row10), 5-row 2 (single dot in row16 at col9).
 * In train2: Generated 5-row 1-frame (rows3-7, pattern wrong/missing in row5), correct-ish 5-row 6 (rows9-13, pattern in row11 matches expected alternating), but 6-row 4 (rows14-19, pattern in row16, extra side rows17-18); expected 5-row 1 (rows3-7), full bg row8, 5-row 6 (9-13), full row14, 5-row 4 (15-19) with pattern in row17—gen includes row14 as top of 4 due to uncleaned bridge.
 * In train3: Generated heavily mixed first block (rows2-6 with 2 and 1 intrusions, wrong L/R), second 5-row 4 (rows8-12 ok-ish but extra 1's), third tall/messed 1 (rows13-18 with repeated sides); expected clean separate 5-row 2 (rows2-6, no 1's), 5-row 4 (8-12), 5-row 1 (14-18, pattern in row16 with 3 dots? for c=1 k=1 but expected has more/ different positions)—gen fails due to uncleaned mixed colors and wrong blocks.
 * The find_and_process_blocks function is broken for multi-object vertical stacks (merges everything); do not use it—replace with per-component detection like find_connected_components.
 * process_shape is partially helpful for frame logic but tied to row blocks (unhelpful for separation); adapt to per-component as in the tool above.
 * No object extraction function was present; adding find_connected_components is essential to separate by color and connectivity, avoiding row-based merging.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a tall 12-row 2-frame (rows2-12, sides 2 from col1-20?, minimal pattern in row3 near right col18-20, but interior bg everywhere else) followed by correct-ish 5-row 3-frame (rows14-18, pattern in row16 at cols6/8 but expected positions likely 7/9 for R=11) and a 7-row 1-frame (rows19-25, full top/bottom, sides, but repeated plain side rows20-23 instead of pattern only in row21, extra height). This mirrors training errors: merged tall block for 2 (probably input has stacked 2 sub-objects or uncleaned bridges), wrong height for 1 (extra rows19-25 instead of 5), and pattern positions slightly off (e.g., 1 for c=1 k=1 should be single dot near right, but gen has plain sides in multiple rows). Expected likely separate 5-row frames for each color (2 split into multiple? , 3 as 5-row with 2-dot pattern, 1 as 5-row with 1-dot), maintaining bg separations; gen over-merges vertically like train1/2, ignoring per-color components.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains scattered non-background colored cells forming rough shapes or objects, and the goal is to clean noise, identify distinct objects (likely connected components of the same color), and transform each sufficiently large object into a standardized rectangular frame using its own color: full top and bottom bars, vertical sides, background-filled interior, and a specific dotted pattern in the third row from the top (positions calculated from the right based on the color value). The output preserves separations via background rows and ensures frames are typically 5 rows high (or adjusted), without merging unrelated objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value in the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all frames respect this by filling interiors and unused areas with it.
 * Pre-process by removing small connected components (same-color, 4-directional connectivity) of size <=5 to eliminate noise like isolated dots or tiny blobs; however, this threshold may be too permissive if small components (>5 cells) bridge separate objects vertically, causing merged blocks.
 * Objects are separate if they are disconnected components of the same color; different colors should not merge even if in consecutive rows without full background rows between them—current row-block approach fails here by treating any non-background in consecutive rows as one block, leading to merged shapes and wrong dominant color selection.
 * For each object, compute bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col); height h = max_row - min_row + 1 must be >=5 and width w = max_col - min_col + 1 >=3 to process; skip smaller ones.
 * Dominant color c is the most frequent non-background color in the object's cells (or the component's color if processing per-component).
 * Frame construction: Set top row (min_row) and bottom row (max_row) fully to c from min_col to max_col; set sides (min_col and max_col) to c on all rows from min_row to max_row; fill interior (rows min_row+1 to max_row-1, cols min_col+1 to max_col-1) with background; do not overwrite other objects.
 * Pattern in middle row = min_row + 2 (third row of frame), only if middle < max_row (i.e., h > 3, but combined with h>=5 check): k = (c + 1) // 2; place c at interior columns col = max_col - 2 * i for i=1 to k, if L < col < R (every other column from the right, up to k positions); this creates denser patterns for higher c (e.g., c=2: 1 dot; c=4: 2 dots; c=8: 4 dots).
 * Special extension rule for last object if h==5, it's the final block (no non-bg below), previous row is all background, and top row is already full c: extend frame upward by 1 row, setting the previous row to full c from L to R, increasing h to 6—but this seems rarely applied in examples and may over-extend if misdetected.
 * Blocks/objects are vertically separated by full background rows; output should maintain these separations without adding or removing them.
 * Process objects independently in bounding boxes to avoid interference; order from top to bottom to handle overlaps (though examples show no overlaps).
 * Subtlety: In some inputs, objects may be vertically stacked closely (no full bg row between), but must remain separate if different colors or disconnected; current approach merges them into tall frames, which is incorrect.
 * Widths vary (e.g., ~11-20 columns in examples), but frames hug the object's extent; right-side pattern placement ensures symmetry or specific alignment, but exact col indexing (0-based vs 1-based) needs verification against examples.
 * All examples show frames exactly 5 rows high (except possible extensions), with patterns only in the third row; tall inputs must be split into multiple 5-row frames if they represent stacked objects.
 * Background fills everything outside frames; no changes to full bg rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The clean_small_components function is helpful for noise removal (removes same-color connected <=5 cells, replacing with bg), but its max_size=5 may need tuning (e.g., to 1-3 for stricter cleaning) or integration with per-color processing to avoid bridging. The has_non_bg_after function is useful for detecting last blocks (for extension rule). The process_shape logic for frame building and pattern placement is mostly correct (dominant c, L/R extent, full top/bottom/sides, interior bg, right-aligned every-other pattern), but must be applied to per-component bounding boxes, not row blocks. The get_background is simple and correct.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The row-block detection in find_and_process_blocks merges vertically adjacent objects of different colors (e.g., 8 and 2 in train1) into one tall block if no full bg row separates them after cleaning, leading to wrong dominant color (picks 2 over 8) and incorrect tall frames (12+ rows instead of separate 5-row frames).
 * Cleaning with max_size=5 removes small noise but leaves larger small components (>5 cells) that bridge blocks, causing extra height (e.g., train2 last 4-block becomes 6 rows instead of 5; train1 second block merges 8 and 2 areas).
 * Dominant color selection works within a block but fails globally because blocks include multiple objects; e.g., in train1, second block picks 2 (more cells?) instead of processing separate 8 and 2 components.
 * Pattern placement and frame structure (full top/bottom, sides, interior bg) are correct when applied (e.g., positions match expected every-other from right; k=(c+1)//2 works for c=2:1 dot at col9; c=4:2 dots; c=8:4 dots at 3,5,7,9), but only applied once per merged block, missing multiple patterns.
 * Extension rule is implemented but not triggered correctly or needed in examples; it over-extends in some cases (e.g., train2 last block) and is skipped when prev row isn't all bg.
 * In train1: Generated correct 5-row 4-frame with no pattern (or minimal), but second "2-frame" is tall (rows7-18, pattern only in row9, sides/full incorrect for 8), third 2 missing entirely; expected separate 5-row 4, 5-row 8 (alternating pattern in row10), 5-row 2 (single dot in row16 at col9).
 * In train2: Generated 5-row 1-frame (rows3-7, pattern wrong/missing in row5), correct-ish 5-row 6 (rows9-13, pattern in row11 matches expected alternating), but 6-row 4 (rows14-19, pattern in row16, extra side rows17-18); expected 5-row 1 (rows3-7), full bg row8, 5-row 6 (9-13), full row14, 5-row 4 (15-19) with pattern in row17—gen includes row14 as top of 4 due to uncleaned bridge.
 * In train3: Generated heavily mixed first block (rows2-6 with 2 and 1 intrusions, wrong L/R), second 5-row 4 (rows8-12 ok-ish but extra 1's), third tall/messed 1 (rows13-18 with repeated sides); expected clean separate 5-row 2 (rows2-6, no 1's), 5-row 4 (8-12), 5-row 1 (14-18, pattern in row16 with 3 dots? for c=1 k=1 but expected has more/ different positions)—gen fails due to uncleaned mixed colors and wrong blocks.
 * The find_and_process_blocks function is broken for multi-object vertical stacks (merges everything); do not use it—replace with per-component detection like find_connected_components.
 * process_shape is partially helpful for frame logic but tied to row blocks (unhelpful for separation); adapt to per-component as in the tool above.
 * No object extraction function was present; adding find_connected_components is essential to separate by color and connectivity, avoiding row-based merging.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a tall 12-row 2-frame (rows2-12, sides 2 from col1-20?, minimal pattern in row3 near right col18-20, but interior bg everywhere else) followed by correct-ish 5-row 3-frame (rows14-18, pattern in row16 at cols6/8 but expected positions likely 7/9 for R=11) and a 7-row 1-frame (rows19-25, full top/bottom, sides, but repeated plain side rows20-23 instead of pattern only in row21, extra height). This mirrors training errors: merged tall block for 2 (probably input has stacked 2 sub-objects or uncleaned bridges), wrong height for 1 (extra rows19-25 instead of 5), and pattern positions slightly off (e.g., 1 for c=1 k=1 should be single dot near right, but gen has plain sides in multiple rows). Expected likely separate 5-row frames for each color (2 split into multiple? , 3 as 5-row with 2-dot pattern, 1 as 5-row with 1-dot), maintaining bg separations; gen over-merges vertically like train1/2, ignoring per-color components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 17:08:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a grid by identifying and cleaning small noise components, detecting large connected regions of non-background colors, and transforming those large regions into "framed" structures: solid top and bottom borders spanning the region's width, vertical side borders on interior rows with background-filled interiors, and a specific patterned infill (alternating or spaced dots of the region's color) in one middle row, while preserving the background and ensuring frames do not overlap or bleed incorrectly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the color at grid[0][0]; all processing must respect this and not alter background areas outside components.
 * Noise cleaning: Remove connected components (4-directional, same color) of non-background cells if their size <=5, replacing them with background; this is crucial for eliminating stray pixels or small artifacts that could be mistaken for parts of frames or create false merges.
 * Component detection: Only process "large" components where height >=5, width >=3, and total size >5; use 4-directional connectivity for same-color cells; sort components by starting row (min_r) to process top-to-bottom and avoid overwriting lower ones.
 * Frame construction: For each component, use the bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c); top/bottom rows get full solid fill of the component's color (c) across overall width; middle rows get vertical sides at computed inner-left (side_L) and inner-right (side_R) positions (derived from max/min column positions in middle rows, excluding top/bottom), with interior filled to background; do not extend beyond grid bounds.
 * Pattern infill: In a specific middle row (e.g., min_r + 2), add a symmetric pattern of the color c: compute k = (c + 1) // 2, then place c at positions side_R - 2*i for i=1 to k (creating spaced "dots" or chevrons inward from the right side); this pattern varies by color (e.g., c=2: k=1, one dot; c=4: k=2, two dots spaced by 2; c=8: k=4, four dots).
 * Sorting and processing order: Components must be sorted by min_r to handle vertical stacking without interference; process in order to avoid modifying already-processed areas.
 * Edge cases: Components may not span the full grid width; inner bounds (side_L, side_R) are computed only from middle rows (excluding top/bottom) to handle irregular shapes; if no middle rows have the color, fall back to overall bounds; ensure no bleeding into adjacent components or background (e.g., right-side noise must be cleaned); grids are rectangular, but components may be offset; multiple components of different colors must be handled independently without merging.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: The pattern is always from the right side inward, not centered or symmetric across the whole interior; k depends on c, so higher colors get more/denser patterns; cleaning must happen before detection to avoid false large components from noise; in stacked components, lower ones may have partial overlaps in column space but must not be altered by upper processing; background borders (e.g., all-1 or all-3 rows) must remain untouched; test inputs may have noise protruding into frame areas, requiring robust cleaning.
 * All considerations: Avoid 8-directional connectivity (stick to 4-dir); do not fill entire interiors solidly—only borders and pattern; handle cases where components touch edges but do not extend frames beyond grid; verify no non-background after processing in unintended areas; patterns should not touch sides (spaced by at least 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This is helpful for extracting bounding boxes of large objects; essential for frame placement; sorting by min_r afterward is key.)

```python
def compute_bounds(g: List[List[int]], c: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Compute side_L, side_R from middle rows, overall_L, overall_R from bounding box."""
    overall_L = min_c
    overall_R = max_c
    middle_min_r = min_r + 1
    middle_max_r = max_r - 1
    row_min_list = []
    row_max_list = []
    cols = len(g[0])
    for r in range(middle_min_r, middle_max_r + 1):
        row_cols = [j for j in range(min_c, min(max_c + 1, cols)) if g[r][j] == c]
        if row_cols:
            row_min_list.append(min(row_cols))
            row_max_list.append(max(row_cols))
    if row_min_list:
        side_L = max(row_min_list)
        side_R = min(row_max_list)
    else:
        side_L = overall_L
        side_R = overall_R
    return side_L, side_R, overall_L, overall_R
```
(This is helpful for accurate side positioning based on middle rows; prevents over-extension in irregular shapes.)

(The process_component and main program functions are partially helpful but flawed in pattern placement and component isolation; the has_non_bg_after function is not used and seems unhelpful/irrelevant to core logic—do not use it in future attempts as it appears broken or unused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 generated extra 2's on the right side of the third component (e.g., row 13 has 2,2,2 at positions 16-18, and row 12 has 2,2,2 at 16-18), which are absent in expected (all 1's there); this suggests failed noise cleaning or incorrect component merging/detection including right-side artifacts.
 * Train 1 correctly handled the first two components (4's and 8's frames and patterns match expected), including proper side bounds and pattern (for 8's: spaced dots in row 9).
 * Train 2 was fully correct, indicating successful cleaning, detection, frame building, and pattern for isolated components.
 * Train 3 generated extra 1's protruding on the right in the first component (e.g., row 1 has 1 at position 16, row 2 has 1,1,1 at 15-17; row 3 has 1,1,1 at 15-17), which expected lacks (all 3's); also, the third component (1's) lacks the expected pattern in row 21 (expected has 1 at positions 7,9,11; generated has only sides, no infill dots).
 * Train 3 correctly handled the second component (4's frame and pattern match) and partially the first (2's frame but with extras) and fourth (1's frame but missing pattern).
 * Overall, attempts succeed when components are isolated without right-side noise but fail on grids with protruding noise or multiple overlapping column spaces, leading to merged/incorrect bounds; pattern application works for some colors (e.g., 4 and 8) but misses for others (e.g., 1, where k=1 should place one dot); cleaning with max_size=5 works for train 2 but insufficient for train 1/3 noise; sorting by min_r helps ordering but not isolation; compute_bounds is essential but over-relies on middle rows, causing side_L/R miscalculation if noise affects them.
 * Function has_non_bg_after is unhelpful and broken (unused in main logic, no clear role in frame building—do not use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has extraneous 2's in the first component (e.g., row 6 ends with 2 at position 18, absent in expected patterns; row 6 also has incomplete bottom fill), suggesting uncleaned noise or bound over-extension; the second component (4's) frame is mostly correct but may have pattern misalignment; the third (3's) and fourth (1's) have correct frames but potentially missing or wrong patterns (e.g., for c=1, expect single dot from right in middle row ~22, but generated shows only sides); overall, right-side bleeding similar to train 1/3 indicates persistent noise handling issue; the output makes partial sense for frame borders but fails on isolation and full pattern fidelity, likely due to uncleaned small components merging into large ones or incorrect side_R computation allowing bleed.

[2025-10-01 17:08:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains scattered non-background colored cells forming rough shapes or objects, and the goal is to clean noise, identify distinct objects (likely connected components of the same color), and transform each sufficiently large object into a standardized rectangular frame using its own color: full top and bottom bars, vertical sides, background-filled interior, and a specific dotted pattern in the third row from the top (positions calculated from the right based on the color value). The output preserves separations via background rows and ensures frames are typically 5 rows high (or adjusted), without merging unrelated objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value in the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all frames respect this by filling interiors and unused areas with it.
 * Pre-process by removing small connected components (same-color, 4-directional connectivity) of size <=5 to eliminate noise like isolated dots or tiny blobs; however, this threshold may be too permissive if small components (>5 cells) bridge separate objects vertically, causing merged blocks.
 * Objects are separate if they are disconnected components of the same color; different colors should not merge even if in consecutive rows without full background rows between them—current row-block approach fails here by treating any non-background in consecutive rows as one block, leading to merged shapes and wrong dominant color selection.
 * For each object, compute bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col); height h = max_row - min_row + 1 must be >=5 and width w = max_col - min_col + 1 >=3 to process; skip smaller ones.
 * Dominant color c is the most frequent non-background color in the object's cells (or the component's color if processing per-component).
 * Frame construction: Set top row (min_row) and bottom row (max_row) fully to c from min_col to max_col; set sides (min_col and max_col) to c on all rows from min_row to max_row; fill interior (rows min_row+1 to max_row-1, cols min_col+1 to max_col-1) with background; do not overwrite other objects.
 * Pattern in middle row = min_row + 2 (third row of frame), only if middle < max_row (i.e., h > 3, but combined with h>=5 check): k = (c + 1) // 2; place c at interior columns col = max_col - 2 * i for i=1 to k, if L < col < R (every other column from the right, up to k positions); this creates denser patterns for higher c (e.g., c=2: 1 dot; c=4: 2 dots; c=8: 4 dots).
 * Special extension rule for last object if h==5, it's the final block (no non-bg below), previous row is all background, and top row is already full c: extend frame upward by 1 row, setting the previous row to full c from L to R, increasing h to 6—but this seems rarely applied in examples and may over-extend if misdetected.
 * Blocks/objects are vertically separated by full background rows; output should maintain these separations without adding or removing them.
 * Process objects independently in bounding boxes to avoid interference; order from top to bottom to handle overlaps (though examples show no overlaps).
 * Subtlety: In some inputs, objects may be vertically stacked closely (no full bg row between), but must remain separate if different colors or disconnected; current approach merges them into tall frames, which is incorrect.
 * Widths vary (e.g., ~11-20 columns in examples), but frames hug the object's extent; right-side pattern placement ensures symmetry or specific alignment, but exact col indexing (0-based vs 1-based) needs verification against examples.
 * All examples show frames exactly 5 rows high (except possible extensions), with patterns only in the third row; tall inputs must be split into multiple 5-row frames if they represent stacked objects.
 * Background fills everything outside frames; no changes to full bg rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The clean_small_components function is helpful for noise removal (removes same-color connected <=5 cells, replacing with bg), but its max_size=5 may need tuning (e.g., to 1-3 for stricter cleaning) or integration with per-color processing to avoid bridging. The has_non_bg_after function is useful for detecting last blocks (for extension rule). The process_shape logic for frame building and pattern placement is mostly correct (dominant c, L/R extent, full top/bottom/sides, interior bg, right-aligned every-other pattern), but must be applied to per-component bounding boxes, not row blocks. The get_background is simple and correct.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The row-block detection in find_and_process_blocks merges vertically adjacent objects of different colors (e.g., 8 and 2 in train1) into one tall block if no full bg row separates them after cleaning, leading to wrong dominant color (picks 2 over 8) and incorrect tall frames (12+ rows instead of separate 5-row frames).
 * Cleaning with max_size=5 removes small noise but leaves larger small components (>5 cells) that bridge blocks, causing extra height (e.g., train2 last 4-block becomes 6 rows instead of 5; train1 second block merges 8 and 2 areas).
 * Dominant color selection works within a block but fails globally because blocks include multiple objects; e.g., in train1, second block picks 2 (more cells?) instead of processing separate 8 and 2 components.
 * Pattern placement and frame structure (full top/bottom, sides, interior bg) are correct when applied (e.g., positions match expected every-other from right; k=(c+1)//2 works for c=2:1 dot at col9; c=4:2 dots; c=8:4 dots at 3,5,7,9), but only applied once per merged block, missing multiple patterns.
 * Extension rule is implemented but not triggered correctly or needed in examples; it over-extends in some cases (e.g., train2 last block) and is skipped when prev row isn't all bg.
 * In train1: Generated correct 5-row 4-frame with no pattern (or minimal), but second "2-frame" is tall (rows7-18, pattern only in row9, sides/full incorrect for 8), third 2 missing entirely; expected separate 5-row 4, 5-row 8 (alternating pattern in row10), 5-row 2 (single dot in row16 at col9).
 * In train2: Generated 5-row 1-frame (rows3-7, pattern wrong/missing in row5), correct-ish 5-row 6 (rows9-13, pattern in row11 matches expected alternating), but 6-row 4 (rows14-19, pattern in row16, extra side rows17-18); expected 5-row 1 (rows3-7), full bg row8, 5-row 6 (9-13), full row14, 5-row 4 (15-19) with pattern in row17—gen includes row14 as top of 4 due to uncleaned bridge.
 * In train3: Generated heavily mixed first block (rows2-6 with 2 and 1 intrusions, wrong L/R), second 5-row 4 (rows8-12 ok-ish but extra 1's), third tall/messed 1 (rows13-18 with repeated sides); expected clean separate 5-row 2 (rows2-6, no 1's), 5-row 4 (8-12), 5-row 1 (14-18, pattern in row16 with 3 dots? for c=1 k=1 but expected has more/ different positions)—gen fails due to uncleaned mixed colors and wrong blocks.
 * The find_and_process_blocks function is broken for multi-object vertical stacks (merges everything); do not use it—replace with per-component detection like find_connected_components.
 * process_shape is partially helpful for frame logic but tied to row blocks (unhelpful for separation); adapt to per-component as in the tool above.
 * No object extraction function was present; adding find_connected_components is essential to separate by color and connectivity, avoiding row-based merging.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a tall 12-row 2-frame (rows2-12, sides 2 from col1-20?, minimal pattern in row3 near right col18-20, but interior bg everywhere else) followed by correct-ish 5-row 3-frame (rows14-18, pattern in row16 at cols6/8 but expected positions likely 7/9 for R=11) and a 7-row 1-frame (rows19-25, full top/bottom, sides, but repeated plain side rows20-23 instead of pattern only in row21, extra height). This mirrors training errors: merged tall block for 2 (probably input has stacked 2 sub-objects or uncleaned bridges), wrong height for 1 (extra rows19-25 instead of 5), and pattern positions slightly off (e.g., 1 for c=1 k=1 should be single dot near right, but gen has plain sides in multiple rows). Expected likely separate 5-row frames for each color (2 split into multiple? , 3 as 5-row with 2-dot pattern, 1 as 5-row with 1-dot), maintaining bg separations; gen over-merges vertically like train1/2, ignoring per-color components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a grid by identifying and cleaning small noise components, detecting large connected regions of non-background colors, and transforming those large regions into "framed" structures: solid top and bottom borders spanning the region's width, vertical side borders on interior rows with background-filled interiors, and a specific patterned infill (alternating or spaced dots of the region's color) in one middle row, while preserving the background and ensuring frames do not overlap or bleed incorrectly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the color at grid[0][0]; all processing must respect this and not alter background areas outside components.
 * Noise cleaning: Remove connected components (4-directional, same color) of non-background cells if their size <=5, replacing them with background; this is crucial for eliminating stray pixels or small artifacts that could be mistaken for parts of frames or create false merges.
 * Component detection: Only process "large" components where height >=5, width >=3, and total size >5; use 4-directional connectivity for same-color cells; sort components by starting row (min_r) to process top-to-bottom and avoid overwriting lower ones.
 * Frame construction: For each component, use the bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c); top/bottom rows get full solid fill of the component's color (c) across overall width; middle rows get vertical sides at computed inner-left (side_L) and inner-right (side_R) positions (derived from max/min column positions in middle rows, excluding top/bottom), with interior filled to background; do not extend beyond grid bounds.
 * Pattern infill: In a specific middle row (e.g., min_r + 2), add a symmetric pattern of the color c: compute k = (c + 1) // 2, then place c at positions side_R - 2*i for i=1 to k (creating spaced "dots" or chevrons inward from the right side); this pattern varies by color (e.g., c=2: k=1, one dot; c=4: k=2, two dots spaced by 2; c=8: k=4, four dots).
 * Sorting and processing order: Components must be sorted by min_r to handle vertical stacking without interference; process in order to avoid modifying already-processed areas.
 * Edge cases: Components may not span the full grid width; inner bounds (side_L, side_R) are computed only from middle rows (excluding top/bottom) to handle irregular shapes; if no middle rows have the color, fall back to overall bounds; ensure no bleeding into adjacent components or background (e.g., right-side noise must be cleaned); grids are rectangular, but components may be offset; multiple components of different colors must be handled independently without merging.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: The pattern is always from the right side inward, not centered or symmetric across the whole interior; k depends on c, so higher colors get more/denser patterns; cleaning must happen before detection to avoid false large components from noise; in stacked components, lower ones may have partial overlaps in column space but must not be altered by upper processing; background borders (e.g., all-1 or all-3 rows) must remain untouched; test inputs may have noise protruding into frame areas, requiring robust cleaning.
 * All considerations: Avoid 8-directional connectivity (stick to 4-dir); do not fill entire interiors solidly—only borders and pattern; handle cases where components touch edges but do not extend frames beyond grid; verify no non-background after processing in unintended areas; patterns should not touch sides (spaced by at least 1).

(This is helpful for extracting bounding boxes of large objects; essential for frame placement; sorting by min_r afterward is key.)

```python
def compute_bounds(g: List[List[int]], c: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Compute side_L, side_R from middle rows, overall_L, overall_R from bounding box."""

        row_cols = [j for j in range(min_c, min(max_c + 1, cols)) if g[r][j] == c]
        if row_cols:
            row_min_list.append(min(row_cols))
            row_max_list.append(max(row_cols))
    if row_min_list:
        side_L = max(row_min_list)
        side_R = min(row_max_list)
    else:
        side_L = overall_L
        side_R = overall_R
    return side_L, side_R, overall_L, overall_R
```
(This is helpful for accurate side positioning based on middle rows; prevents over-extension in irregular shapes.)

(The process_component and main program functions are partially helpful but flawed in pattern placement and component isolation; the has_non_bg_after function is not used and seems unhelpful/irrelevant to core logic—do not use it in future attempts as it appears broken or unused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 generated extra 2's on the right side of the third component (e.g., row 13 has 2,2,2 at positions 16-18, and row 12 has 2,2,2 at 16-18), which are absent in expected (all 1's there); this suggests failed noise cleaning or incorrect component merging/detection including right-side artifacts.
 * Train 1 correctly handled the first two components (4's and 8's frames and patterns match expected), including proper side bounds and pattern (for 8's: spaced dots in row 9).
 * Train 2 was fully correct, indicating successful cleaning, detection, frame building, and pattern for isolated components.
 * Train 3 generated extra 1's protruding on the right in the first component (e.g., row 1 has 1 at position 16, row 2 has 1,1,1 at 15-17; row 3 has 1,1,1 at 15-17), which expected lacks (all 3's); also, the third component (1's) lacks the expected pattern in row 21 (expected has 1 at positions 7,9,11; generated has only sides, no infill dots).
 * Train 3 correctly handled the second component (4's frame and pattern match) and partially the first (2's frame but with extras) and fourth (1's frame but missing pattern).
 * Overall, attempts succeed when components are isolated without right-side noise but fail on grids with protruding noise or multiple overlapping column spaces, leading to merged/incorrect bounds; pattern application works for some colors (e.g., 4 and 8) but misses for others (e.g., 1, where k=1 should place one dot); cleaning with max_size=5 works for train 2 but insufficient for train 1/3 noise; sorting by min_r helps ordering but not isolation; compute_bounds is essential but over-relies on middle rows, causing side_L/R miscalculation if noise affects them.
 * Function has_non_bg_after is unhelpful and broken (unused in main logic, no clear role in frame building—do not use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has extraneous 2's in the first component (e.g., row 6 ends with 2 at position 18, absent in expected patterns; row 6 also has incomplete bottom fill), suggesting uncleaned noise or bound over-extension; the second component (4's) frame is mostly correct but may have pattern misalignment; the third (3's) and fourth (1's) have correct frames but potentially missing or wrong patterns (e.g., for c=1, expect single dot from right in middle row ~22, but generated shows only sides); overall, right-side bleeding similar to train 1/3 indicates persistent noise handling issue; the output makes partial sense for frame borders but fails on isolation and full pattern fidelity, likely due to uncleaned small components merging into large ones or incorrect side_R computation allowing bleed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
