=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 19:02:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:10:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells) of non-background colors are erased to the background, and then specific "frame" structures made of erased colors are completed by filling symmetric patterns inside their vertical border rows, likely representing windows or panels with color-coded internal designs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent color in the grid.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same color; only non-bg components smaller than 12 cells are erased, and their colors are tracked in a set (small_colors) for later use in completing frames.
 * Frames are detected starting from potential top horizontal bars: exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (where c is in small_colors) in a row, fully bordered on left/right by bg or grid edge; no partial or longer bars are considered.
 * Immediately below the top bar, there must be at least 2 consecutive "v-rows" (vertical border rows): each with c only at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the bar span, and all inner positions (between left+1 and right-1) must be bg; the loop continues counting consecutive v-rows beyond 2 but breaks on non-v-row, and filling only triggers if >=2 v-rows found.
 * Immediately after the final v-row, there must be a matching bottom horizontal bar (11 cells of c, bordered left/right by bg or edge).
 * Filling occurs only in the row index of the exact 2nd v-row (fill_i set when num_v reaches 2), placing c cells at inner positions calculated as right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m (symmetric every-other-column pattern from near the right edge, skipping the sides and bg inners); m = c // 2 by default, but special override for c==1 sets m = num_v - 2 (where num_v is the total consecutive v-rows found, which can exceed 2).
 * Only frames of colors in small_colors are completed (skips others, e.g., no filling in color 2 frames if 2 had no small components erased).
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 20x23 in training3, taller in test); scanning for top bars starts from row 0 to h-4 (to allow space for top + 2 v + bottom), and horizontally from col 0 to w-11.
 * Subtle: In examples, frames for different colors have 3 consecutive v-rows (e.g., top bar, v1, v2 (fill row), v3, bottom bar), but filling is always in v2 regardless of total num_v; the every-other fill pattern starts from right-2 (e.g., for span left=1/right=11, fills col9 then col7 for m=2, leaving col10/8/6/etc as bg).
 * Subtle: For c=1, the special m = num_v - 2 with num_v=3 yields m=1 (fills only col9), but this mismatches expectation (needs m=2 to fill col9 and col7); possibly c=1 should always use m=2, or m = (c + something)//2, or fill based on num_v independently of c.
 * Subtle: No overlapping frame detection or handling; each potential top bar is checked independently, which could lead to multiple completions in complex grids.
 * Subtle: After erasing small components, the grid is modified in-place, so v-row inners must remain bg (not affected by prior erasures); bars must be fully solid post-erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Borders can be grid edges (no need for bg beyond), but inners in v-rows must be strictly bg; span is hardcoded to 11, suggesting fixed frame width in the puzzle.
 * Easy to miss: num_v counts all consecutive v-rows (can be >2), but fill_i locks to the 2nd; for c!=1, m ignores num_v.
 * Considerations across attempts: No blob extraction beyond BFS in erase_small; no handling for non-frame small colors or vertical/horizontal variations; assumes all frames are horizontal-bar based with fixed span; test grid is taller (28 rows?), potentially with multiple frames stacked vertically, risking over-completion if partial structures exist.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it correctly erases small components (<12 cells) and uses small_colors to selectively complete frames, passing training examples 1 and 2 fully.
 * Successfully detects frames with 3 v-rows and fills correctly for c=4 (m=2, places c at col7 and col9 in 2nd v-row, matching expected symmetric every-other pattern from right).
 * Correctly skips filling for c=2 frame (no inner placements, as expected), likely because 2 not in small_colors (no small 2-components erased).
 * Fails training3 for c=1 frame: generates 1's only at col1,9,11 in row15 (2nd v-row, m=1 fills only col9 + sides), but expected 1's at col1,7,9,11 (needs m=2 to also fill col7); difference is missing inner 1 at col7, due to special c=1 rule yielding m=1 (with num_v=3) instead of m=2.
 * No issues with bar detection or bordering in training3 (top/bottom bars and v-rows match expected structure post-fill).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt (no prior attempts shown, but if from earlier, a general blob extractor would be similar to erase_small's BFS and helpful for debugging components, but not essential here as frames are structure-based, not arbitrary blobs).
 * The complete_frames function is mostly correct but broken for c=1 filling amount (under-fills by one position); the every-other pattern logic works but hardcoded span=11 limits flexibility.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; erase_small is precise and relevant, complete_frames is core but needs c=1 fix (e.g., hardcode m=2 for c=1 or adjust formula to m = max(c//2, 2) or m = (num_v -1)//1 for c=1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (applies same logic as training: fills c=4 frame with two inners at col7/9 in 2nd v-row row9; fills c=3 frame with one inner at col9 in 2nd v-row row15, m=3//2=1; fills two separate c=1 frames, each with one inner at col9 in their 2nd v-rows rows21 and ?—wait, bottom frame rows19 top,20 v1,21 v2 (fill),22 v3,23 bottom).
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to training3 error, c=1 fillings under-fill (only col9 + sides per frame, but likely needs col7/9 + sides like expected in training3, suggesting same m=1 bug); for c=3 (odd like1), only one fill (col9) may be wrong if rule intends m=2 or more for odds (unknown without expected, but pattern mismatch risk). Most critically, it over-completes an unexpected second full 1 frame at rows19-23 (with fill in row21), plus extra all-bg rows at end—this likely shouldn't happen if test input had only partial/unintended structure there (e.g., no top/bottom bars or not in small_colors), indicating code falsely detects/completes non-frame artifacts; top c=2 frame correctly has no fill (skipped, as in training). Overall, demonstrates core frame detection but fails on fill count for specials (1 and possibly3) and risks false positives in taller grids with stacked elements.

 * Frames are detected starting from potential top horizontal bars: exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (where c is in small_colors) in a row, fully bordered on left/right by bg or grid edge; no partial or longer bars are considered.
 * Immediately below the top bar, there must be at least 2 consecutive "v-rows" (vertical border rows): each with c only at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the bar span, and all inner positions (between left+1 and right-1) must be bg; the loop continues counting consecutive v-rows beyond 2 but breaks on non-v-row, and filling only triggers if >=2 v-rows found.
 * Immediately after the final v-row, there must be a matching bottom horizontal bar (11 cells of c, bordered left/right by bg or edge).
 * Filling occurs only in the row index of the exact 2nd v-row (fill_i set when num_v reaches 2), placing c cells at inner positions calculated as right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m (symmetric every-other-column pattern from near the right edge, skipping the sides and bg inners); m = c // 2 by default, but special override for c==1 sets m = num_v - 2 (where num_v is the total consecutive v-rows found, which can exceed 2).
 * Only frames of colors in small_colors are completed (skips others, e.g., no filling in color 2 frames if 2 had no small components erased).
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 20x23 in training3, taller in test); scanning for top bars starts from row 0 to h-4 (to allow space for top + 2 v + bottom), and horizontally from col 0 to w-11.
 * Subtle: In examples, frames for different colors have 3 consecutive v-rows (e.g., top bar, v1, v2 (fill row), v3, bottom bar), but filling is always in v2 regardless of total num_v; the every-other fill pattern starts from right-2 (e.g., for span left=1/right=11, fills col9 then col7 for m=2, leaving col10/8/6/etc as bg).
 * Subtle: For c=1, the special m = num_v - 2 with num_v=3 yields m=1 (fills only col9), but this mismatches expectation (needs m=2 to fill col9 and col7); possibly c=1 should always use m=2, or m = (c + something)//2, or fill based on num_v independently of c.
 * Subtle: No overlapping frame detection or handling; each potential top bar is checked independently, which could lead to multiple completions in complex grids.
 * Subtle: After erasing small components, the grid is modified in-place, so v-row inners must remain bg (not affected by prior erasures); bars must be fully solid post-erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Borders can be grid edges (no need for bg beyond), but inners in v-rows must be strictly bg; span is hardcoded to 11, suggesting fixed frame width in the puzzle.
 * Easy to miss: num_v counts all consecutive v-rows (can be >2), but fill_i locks to the 2nd; for c!=1, m ignores num_v.
 * Considerations across attempts: No blob extraction beyond BFS in erase_small; no handling for non-frame small colors or vertical/horizontal variations; assumes all frames are horizontal-bar based with fixed span; test grid is taller (28 rows?), potentially with multiple frames stacked vertically, risking over-completion if partial structures exist.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it correctly erases small components (<12 cells) and uses small_colors to selectively complete frames, passing training examples 1 and 2 fully.
 * Successfully detects frames with 3 v-rows and fills correctly for c=4 (m=2, places c at col7 and col9 in 2nd v-row, matching expected symmetric every-other pattern from right).
 * Correctly skips filling for c=2 frame (no inner placements, as expected), likely because 2 not in small_colors (no small 2-components erased).
 * Fails training3 for c=1 frame: generates 1's only at col1,9,11 in row15 (2nd v-row, m=1 fills only col9 + sides), but expected 1's at col1,7,9,11 (needs m=2 to also fill col7); difference is missing inner 1 at col7, due to special c=1 rule yielding m=1 (with num_v=3) instead of m=2.
 * No issues with bar detection or bordering in training3 (top/bottom bars and v-rows match expected structure post-fill).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt (no prior attempts shown, but if from earlier, a general blob extractor would be similar to erase_small's BFS and helpful for debugging components, but not essential here as frames are structure-based, not arbitrary blobs).
 * The complete_frames function is mostly correct but broken for c=1 filling amount (under-fills by one position); the every-other pattern logic works but hardcoded span=11 limits flexibility.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; erase_small is precise and relevant, complete_frames is core but needs c=1 fix (e.g., hardcode m=2 for c=1 or adjust formula to m = max(c//2, 2) or m = (num_v -1)//1 for c=1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (applies same logic as training: fills c=4 frame with two inners at col7/9 in 2nd v-row row9; fills c=3 frame with one inner at col9 in 2nd v-row row15, m=3//2=1; fills two separate c=1 frames, each with one inner at col9 in their 2nd v-rows rows21 and ?—wait, bottom frame rows19 top,20 v1,21 v2 (fill),22 v3,23 bottom).
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to training3 error, c=1 fillings under-fill (only col9 + sides per frame, but likely needs col7/9 + sides like expected in training3, suggesting same m=1 bug); for c=3 (odd like1), only one fill (col9) may be wrong if rule intends m=2 or more for odds (unknown without expected, but pattern mismatch risk). Most critically, it over-completes an unexpected second full 1 frame at rows19-23 (with fill in row21), plus extra all-bg rows at end—this likely shouldn't happen if test input had only partial/unintended structure there (e.g., no top/bottom bars or not in small_colors), indicating code falsely detects/completes non-frame artifacts; top c=2 frame correctly has no fill (skipped, as in training). Overall, demonstrates core frame detection but fails on fill count for specials (1 and possibly3) and risks false positives in taller grids with stacked elements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid

[2025-10-01 19:17:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells of the same non-background color) are erased to the background color (most common color, typically 8), and then incomplete "frame" or "window" structures are detected and completed by filling specific internal patterns in the second vertical support row of the frame, based on the color value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flat grid (e.g., 8); all other colors are potential objects.
 * Erase only connected components (4-directional adjacency) of size <12; larger ones stay intact. Erased cells are set to bg and tracked per color for potential later use (e.g., counting erased positions in specific rows).
 * Frames are rectangular structures spanning exactly 11 columns (span=11): a full top bar row of the color (all 11 cells same, bordered left/right by bg or edge), preceded by a full bg row above; followed by exactly two "vertical" rows (sides at left/right columns are color, internals bg); then a full bottom bar row (same as top, bordered); followed by a full bg row below.
 * Filling happens only in the second vertical row: sides (left/right) are already color (or partially), internals start as bg (possibly with some erased remnants).
 * Filling pattern: Place color in internal positions starting from the right, every 2 columns inward, for a number of positions m determined by color c: for c>1, m = c // 2; for c=1, special logic attempts m=2 minus count of already-erased (but non-bg?) positions in that row's internals, but this is buggy and leads to under-filling.
 * Subtlety: Detection must ensure exact structure (no extra rows, precise bordering, consecutive verticals exactly 2); frames don't overlap or nest in examples.
 * After erasing, some vertical rows may have partial internals already (erased small bits), but filling overrides to bg implicitly? No, code fills on bg or erased.
 * Min_size=12 is fixed; span=11 fixed for bars.
 * Grids are 23x23 in examples (h=23,w=23?), with frames aligned starting from various columns but often offset by 2 (e.g., cols 2-12).
 * For c=1, expected filling seems to place 1 internal (e.g., near right), but code's special case fails to match, possibly due to incorrect erased_count (counts erased positions but may include non-relevant or overcount).
 * Higher c fill more internals (e.g., c=6 fills 3 internals at positions right-2, right-4, right-6).
 * No filling in first vertical row; only second.
 * Erasure happens first, potentially removing small parts of frames, making completion necessary.
 * Potential miss: Frames must have above_bg and below_bg rows fully bg in the span; vertical rows must have exactly sides color and internals bg before filling.
 * Colors are low integers (1-6 in examples); no rotation or other symmetries.
 * Test input has multiple stacked frames (colors 4,3,1,2 from top? No, 2 top, then4,3,1 bottom), all with similar incomplete seconds V rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

# Good: Standard flood-fill to find and erase small components (<12), tracks erased positions per color.
def erase_small(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int, small_colors: set, erased: Dict[int, List[tuple]]) -> None:
    # Uses BFS/deque for components, 4 dirs, marks visited, collects component list.
    # If len < min_size, add color to small_colors, append positions to erased[color], set to bg.
    # Essential for initial cleanup; works correctly in all trains.
```
```python
# Helpful but buggy: Detects frames and attempts filling in second V row.
# Core logic for frame detection (top bar, above_bg, verticals count==2, bottom bar, below_bg) is solid and works for trains 1/3.
# Filling logic partial: for c>1, m=c//2, fills right-2*kk for kk=1 to m (every 2 cols from right inward).
# For c=1, special m=2 - erased_count (counts erased in internals of that row), but erased_count often wrong (e.g., counts 1 but should be 0?), leading to m=1 but wrong position or underfill.
# Also, for c=1 fills only if m>0, positions only internals (left < pos < right).
def complete_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, small_colors: set, erased: Dict[int, List[tuple]], h: int, w: int) -> None:
    # Loops over possible top rows i (h-4), start cols (w-span+1).
    # Checks c in small_colors (erased color), above_bg full span, top bar full c, borders.
    # Counts consecutive V rows (sides c, internals bg), requires >=2, tracks fill_i as second V row.
    # Checks bottom bar at j, borders, below_bg.
    # Then fills in fill_i row: for c==1 special erased_count in internals, m=2-erased_count; else m=c//2.
    # Fills g[fill_i][pos]=c for pos=right-2*kk, if internal.
```
```python
# Basic but useful: Main program wrapper.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes bg via Counter on flat.
    # Copies g to work_g.
    # Calls erase_small with min_size=12.
    # Then complete_frames.
    # Returns work_g (modified copy).
    # Works end-to-end for trains 1/3.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; no prior ones shown.
 * Worked: Training example 1 and 3 fully correct (likely simple frames with c>1 or no c=1 issues, proper erasure and filling matched expected).
 * Did not work: Training example 2 incorrect—under-filled internals in second V rows for all colors, but especially c=1 (generated row4 for c=1: only sides col2:1 and col12:1, no internal; expected: sides + col10:1, so missing one internal). For c=4 row16: generated only sides + ? (code should fill col8:4,col10:4 but output shows missing col8/col10? Wait, generated matches expected for c=4/6 visually in print but user marked INCORRECT—possible print error or subtle diff in c=1/6; specifically, for c=6 row10 generated misses col6:6 and col8:6 (only sides + col10?:6? but print shows only sides col2:6 col12:6); expected has col2:6, col6:6, col8:6, col10:6, col12:6. For c=4 similar underfill. Reason unknown but likely m=c//2 undercounts or filling loop skips (e.g., pos not internal). For c=1, special erased_count=1 (perhaps counting a pre-erased cell wrong), m=1, but fills wrong pos (right-2=col10, but generated didn't place it).
 * erase_small is correct and essential (properly identifies/erases small components without touching large frames).
 * complete_frames frame detection works (finds positions correctly for trains 1/3), but filling buggy: special c=1 logic broken (erased_count miscounts, e.g., includes side or non-internal); for c>1, may skip if pos==side or out of bounds subtly; doesn't handle if first V row has remnants affecting detection.
 * No unhelpful functions shown; all are relevant but filling needs fix (e.g., unify m= max(1, c//2) or pattern-based, not erased-dependent; for c=1 always fill 1 at right-2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, mirroring train2's under-filling issues (likely buggy filling logic applied consistently).
 * Generated shows erasure happened (no small blobs left), and partial frame completion: e.g., for top frame c=2 (rows1-5, cols1-11), second V row2? Wait row3 (0-index? row3:[8,2,8x7,2,8,2,8x...] has sides col1:2 col11:2 + internal col9:2 (right-2=9), but for m=2//2=1 correct per code, but expected likely needs 1 or 2 internals (e.g., col7:2 and/or col9:2 for "2" pattern?); similar for c=4 rows7-11 cols1-11, second V row9? Wait row10:[8,4,8x5,4,8,4,8,4,8x] wait col1:4, col7:4? (after 5 8's col2-6, col7:4, col8:8 col9:4 col10:8 col11:4—yes col7,9 filled for m=2, matches expected pattern like train2 c=4). For c=3 rows13-17 cols1-11, second V row15:[8,3,8x7,3,8,3,8x] col1:3, col9:3, col11:3 (m=1 at col9, likely underfill if expected col7,9). For c=1 rows19-23 cols1-11, second V row21:[8,1,8x7,1,8,1,8x] similar col1:1 col9:1 col11:1 (special m=1? at col9, but train2 suggests expected only/more at col10 or col8+10, so mismatched position/underfill). Overall, fills every-2-from-right but wrong count/pos for low c (1,2,3); looks like train2 failure extended (underfills internals, e.g., c=1/2/3 get only 1 internal vs. expected 1-2; c=4 gets correct 2). Does not match expected (unknown but inferred from train2: more internals for low c, precise positions).

[2025-10-01 19:17:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells) of non-background colors are erased to the background, and then specific "frame" structures made of erased colors are completed by filling symmetric patterns inside their vertical border rows, likely representing windows or panels with color-coded internal designs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent color in the grid.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same color; only non-bg components smaller than 12 cells are erased, and their colors are tracked in a set (small_colors) for later use in completing frames.
 * Frames are detected starting from potential top horizontal bars: exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (where c is in small_colors) in a row, fully bordered on left/right by bg or grid edge; no partial or longer bars are considered.
 * Immediately below the top bar, there must be at least 2 consecutive "v-rows" (vertical border rows): each with c only at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the bar span, and all inner positions (between left+1 and right-1) must be bg; the loop continues counting consecutive v-rows beyond 2 but breaks on non-v-row, and filling only triggers if >=2 v-rows found.
 * Immediately after the final v-row, there must be a matching bottom horizontal bar (11 cells of c, bordered left/right by bg or edge).
 * Filling occurs only in the row index of the exact 2nd v-row (fill_i set when num_v reaches 2), placing c cells at inner positions calculated as right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m (symmetric every-other-column pattern from near the right edge, skipping the sides and bg inners); m = c // 2 by default, but special override for c==1 sets m = num_v - 2 (where num_v is the total consecutive v-rows found, which can exceed 2).
 * Only frames of colors in small_colors are completed (skips others, e.g., no filling in color 2 frames if 2 had no small components erased).
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 20x23 in training3, taller in test); scanning for top bars starts from row 0 to h-4 (to allow space for top + 2 v + bottom), and horizontally from col 0 to w-11.
 * Subtle: In examples, frames for different colors have 3 consecutive v-rows (e.g., top bar, v1, v2 (fill row), v3, bottom bar), but filling is always in v2 regardless of total num_v; the every-other fill pattern starts from right-2 (e.g., for span left=1/right=11, fills col9 then col7 for m=2, leaving col10/8/6/etc as bg).
 * Subtle: For c=1, the special m = num_v - 2 with num_v=3 yields m=1 (fills only col9), but this mismatches expectation (needs m=2 to fill col9 and col7); possibly c=1 should always use m=2, or m = (c + something)//2, or fill based on num_v independently of c.
 * Subtle: No overlapping frame detection or handling; each potential top bar is checked independently, which could lead to multiple completions in complex grids.
 * Subtle: After erasing small components, the grid is modified in-place, so v-row inners must remain bg (not affected by prior erasures); bars must be fully solid post-erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Borders can be grid edges (no need for bg beyond), but inners in v-rows must be strictly bg; span is hardcoded to 11, suggesting fixed frame width in the puzzle.
 * Easy to miss: num_v counts all consecutive v-rows (can be >2), but fill_i locks to the 2nd; for c!=1, m ignores num_v.
 * Considerations across attempts: No blob extraction beyond BFS in erase_small; no handling for non-frame small colors or vertical/horizontal variations; assumes all frames are horizontal-bar based with fixed span; test grid is taller (28 rows?), potentially with multiple frames stacked vertically, risking over-completion if partial structures exist.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it correctly erases small components (<12 cells) and uses small_colors to selectively complete frames, passing training examples 1 and 2 fully.
 * Successfully detects frames with 3 v-rows and fills correctly for c=4 (m=2, places c at col7 and col9 in 2nd v-row, matching expected symmetric every-other pattern from right).
 * Correctly skips filling for c=2 frame (no inner placements, as expected), likely because 2 not in small_colors (no small 2-components erased).
 * Fails training3 for c=1 frame: generates 1's only at col1,9,11 in row15 (2nd v-row, m=1 fills only col9 + sides), but expected 1's at col1,7,9,11 (needs m=2 to also fill col7); difference is missing inner 1 at col7, due to special c=1 rule yielding m=1 (with num_v=3) instead of m=2.
 * No issues with bar detection or bordering in training3 (top/bottom bars and v-rows match expected structure post-fill).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt (no prior attempts shown, but if from earlier, a general blob extractor would be similar to erase_small's BFS and helpful for debugging components, but not essential here as frames are structure-based, not arbitrary blobs).
 * The complete_frames function is mostly correct but broken for c=1 filling amount (under-fills by one position); the every-other pattern logic works but hardcoded span=11 limits flexibility.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; erase_small is precise and relevant, complete_frames is core but needs c=1 fix (e.g., hardcode m=2 for c=1 or adjust formula to m = max(c//2, 2) or m = (num_v -1)//1 for c=1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (applies same logic as training: fills c=4 frame with two inners at col7/9 in 2nd v-row row9; fills c=3 frame with one inner at col9 in 2nd v-row row15, m=3//2=1; fills two separate c=1 frames, each with one inner at col9 in their 2nd v-rows rows21 and ?—wait, bottom frame rows19 top,20 v1,21 v2 (fill),22 v3,23 bottom).
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to training3 error, c=1 fillings under-fill (only col9 + sides per frame, but likely needs col7/9 + sides like expected in training3, suggesting same m=1 bug); for c=3 (odd like1), only one fill (col9) may be wrong if rule intends m=2 or more for odds (unknown without expected, but pattern mismatch risk). Most critically, it over-completes an unexpected second full 1 frame at rows19-23 (with fill in row21), plus extra all-bg rows at end—this likely shouldn't happen if test input had only partial/unintended structure there (e.g., no top/bottom bars or not in small_colors), indicating code falsely detects/completes non-frame artifacts; top c=2 frame correctly has no fill (skipped, as in training). Overall, demonstrates core frame detection but fails on fill count for specials (1 and possibly3) and risks false positives in taller grids with stacked elements.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells of the same non-background color) are erased to the background color (most common color, typically 8), and then incomplete "frame" or "window" structures are detected and completed by filling specific internal patterns in the second vertical support row of the frame, based on the color value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flat grid (e.g., 8); all other colors are potential objects.
 * Erase only connected components (4-directional adjacency) of size <12; larger ones stay intact. Erased cells are set to bg and tracked per color for potential later use (e.g., counting erased positions in specific rows).
 * Frames are rectangular structures spanning exactly 11 columns (span=11): a full top bar row of the color (all 11 cells same, bordered left/right by bg or edge), preceded by a full bg row above; followed by exactly two "vertical" rows (sides at left/right columns are color, internals bg); then a full bottom bar row (same as top, bordered); followed by a full bg row below.
 * Filling happens only in the second vertical row: sides (left/right) are already color (or partially), internals start as bg (possibly with some erased remnants).
 * Filling pattern: Place color in internal positions starting from the right, every 2 columns inward, for a number of positions m determined by color c: for c>1, m = c // 2; for c=1, special logic attempts m=2 minus count of already-erased (but non-bg?) positions in that row's internals, but this is buggy and leads to under-filling.
 * Subtlety: Detection must ensure exact structure (no extra rows, precise bordering, consecutive verticals exactly 2); frames don't overlap or nest in examples.
 * After erasing, some vertical rows may have partial internals already (erased small bits), but filling overrides to bg implicitly? No, code fills on bg or erased.
 * Min_size=12 is fixed; span=11 fixed for bars.
 * Grids are 23x23 in examples (h=23,w=23?), with frames aligned starting from various columns but often offset by 2 (e.g., cols 2-12).
 * For c=1, expected filling seems to place 1 internal (e.g., near right), but code's special case fails to match, possibly due to incorrect erased_count (counts erased positions but may include non-relevant or overcount).
 * Higher c fill more internals (e.g., c=6 fills 3 internals at positions right-2, right-4, right-6).
 * No filling in first vertical row; only second.
 * Erasure happens first, potentially removing small parts of frames, making completion necessary.
 * Potential miss: Frames must have above_bg and below_bg rows fully bg in the span; vertical rows must have exactly sides color and internals bg before filling.
 * Colors are low integers (1-6 in examples); no rotation or other symmetries.
 * Test input has multiple stacked frames (colors 4,3,1,2 from top? No, 2 top, then4,3,1 bottom), all with similar incomplete seconds V rows.

    # Fills g[fill_i][pos]=c for pos=right-2*kk, if internal.
```
```python
# Basic but useful: Main program wrapper.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes bg via Counter on flat.
    # Copies g to work_g.
    # Calls erase_small with min_size=12.
    # Then complete_frames.
    # Returns work_g (modified copy).
    # Works end-to-end for trains 1/3.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; no prior ones shown.
 * Worked: Training example 1 and 3 fully correct (likely simple frames with c>1 or no c=1 issues, proper erasure and filling matched expected).
 * Did not work: Training example 2 incorrect—under-filled internals in second V rows for all colors, but especially c=1 (generated row4 for c=1: only sides col2:1 and col12:1, no internal; expected: sides + col10:1, so missing one internal). For c=4 row16: generated only sides + ? (code should fill col8:4,col10:4 but output shows missing col8/col10? Wait, generated matches expected for c=4/6 visually in print but user marked INCORRECT—possible print error or subtle diff in c=1/6; specifically, for c=6 row10 generated misses col6:6 and col8:6 (only sides + col10?:6? but print shows only sides col2:6 col12:6); expected has col2:6, col6:6, col8:6, col10:6, col12:6. For c=4 similar underfill. Reason unknown but likely m=c//2 undercounts or filling loop skips (e.g., pos not internal). For c=1, special erased_count=1 (perhaps counting a pre-erased cell wrong), m=1, but fills wrong pos (right-2=col10, but generated didn't place it).
 * erase_small is correct and essential (properly identifies/erases small components without touching large frames).
 * complete_frames frame detection works (finds positions correctly for trains 1/3), but filling buggy: special c=1 logic broken (erased_count miscounts, e.g., includes side or non-internal); for c>1, may skip if pos==side or out of bounds subtly; doesn't handle if first V row has remnants affecting detection.
 * No unhelpful functions shown; all are relevant but filling needs fix (e.g., unify m= max(1, c//2) or pattern-based, not erased-dependent; for c=1 always fill 1 at right-2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, mirroring train2's under-filling issues (likely buggy filling logic applied consistently).
 * Generated shows erasure happened (no small blobs left), and partial frame completion: e.g., for top frame c=2 (rows1-5, cols1-11), second V row2? Wait row3 (0-index? row3:[8,2,8x7,2,8,2,8x...] has sides col1:2 col11:2 + internal col9:2 (right-2=9), but for m=2//2=1 correct per code, but expected likely needs 1 or 2 internals (e.g., col7:2 and/or col9:2 for "2" pattern?); similar for c=4 rows7-11 cols1-11, second V row9? Wait row10:[8,4,8x5,4,8,4,8,4,8x] wait col1:4, col7:4? (after 5 8's col2-6, col7:4, col8:8 col9:4 col10:8 col11:4—yes col7,9 filled for m=2, matches expected pattern like train2 c=4). For c=3 rows13-17 cols1-11, second V row15:[8,3,8x7,3,8,3,8x] col1:3, col9:3, col11:3 (m=1 at col9, likely underfill if expected col7,9). For c=1 rows19-23 cols1-11, second V row21:[8,1,8x7,1,8,1,8x] similar col1:1 col9:1 col11:1 (special m=1? at col9, but train2 suggests expected only/more at col10 or col8+10, so mismatched position/underfill). Overall, fills every-2-from-right but wrong count/pos for low c (1,2,3); looks like train2 failure extended (underfills internals, e.g., c=1/2/3 get only 1 internal vs. expected 1-2; c=4 gets correct 2). Does not match expected (unknown but inferred from train2: more internals for low c, precise positions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:26:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple incomplete rectangular "frames" (likely representing digits or symbols in a bar-based display like seven-segment, but boxed), where each frame uses a distinct non-background color. The goal is to identify the background color, remove small noise components, detect these frames based on top/bottom horizontal bars and side verticals, and complete missing internal horizontal bars in the appropriate row (typically the second vertical row) with a color-specific pattern to form complete shapes, without altering existing structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all processing treats it as empty space.
 * Small connected components (4-directional adjacency) of non-background cells smaller than 12 cells should be erased to background, as they represent noise; larger components are presumed part of valid frames/digits.
 * Frames are fixed-size: horizontal bars are exactly 11 cells long, bordered on left/right by background or grid edge; vertical sides must align perfectly with these bars, with all inner cells (between left/right) being background for validity.
 * Detection requires: a top horizontal bar, at least 2 consecutive valid vertical rows below it (sides present, inner background), followed immediately by a matching bottom horizontal bar; frames are scanned starting from each possible top row (up to h-4 to allow space).
 * Completion happens only in the row where the second valid vertical is detected (fill_i); no filling in other rows, even if more vertical rows exist (e.g., some frames have 3 vertical rows, but fill only targets the second).
 * Filling pattern is color-dependent: m = c // 2 (special case m=2 for c=1); place m evenly spaced bars (every 2 cells) from the right edge inward, only if position is strictly between left and right (no overwriting sides); this aims to complete internal horizontal segments specific to the "digit" implied by color, but patterns vary (e.g., full middle bar for some like 6/0/8, partial for 2/3/4/5, minimal/none for 1/7).
 * Subtlety: Vertical validation (is_v and inner_bg) is strict—any non-background in inner cells during vertical rows breaks detection; bottom bar must have clean borders like top.
 * Frames do not overlap and are horizontally aligned starting at varying columns (e.g., col 1 or 2), with rest of grid as background; multiple frames stack vertically with background rows separating them.
 * Easy to miss: For some colors (e.g., 1,2), the expected pattern has fewer or differently positioned internal bars than the even-from-right rule; overfilling adds unwanted bars (e.g., in color 2's second vertical row), underfilling misses needed ones (e.g., in color 1); existing bars in input may already partially fill, but code overwrites to c if matching pattern.
 * No rotation, diagonal connections, or non-rectangular shapes; all frames are axis-aligned boxes ~5 rows high (top + 2-3 verticals + bottom).
 * After processing, output the modified grid; no further cleanup or symmetry enforcement.
 * Considerations across attempts: Color-specific patterns are not uniform (e.g., 4 needs bars at positions like 8,10,12 but code fills 7,9 for start=1); detection may fail if vertical rows have pre-existing internal non-bg (breaking inner_bg); small components threshold of 12 works for noise but might erase valid partial bars if <12; scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) matters for overlapping detections (though none observed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 8 in ex2/test, 3 in ex3; essential first step.)

```python
def erase_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] == bg:
                continue
            component = []
            q = deque([(i, j)])
            visited[i][j] = True
            color = g[i][j]
            while q:
                x, y = q.popleft()
                component.append((x, y))
                for dx, dy in dirs:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                        visited[nx][ny] = True
                        q.append((nx, ny))
            if len(component) < 12:
                for x, y in component:
                    g[x][y] = bg
```
(This correctly removes noise smaller than 12 connected cells of same color; works well in all examples, preserving frame structures; uses BFS for components—helpful and not broken.)

```python
def detect_and_complete_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> None:

                if is_v and inner_bg:
                    num_v += 1
                    if num_v == 2:

            bottom_border_right = right == w - 1 or g[j][right + 1] == bg
            if is_bottom and bottom_border_left and bottom_border_right:
                if fill_i != -1:
                    m = c // 2
                    if c == 1:
                        m = 2
                    for kk in range(1, m + 1):
                        pos = right - 2 * kk
                        if left < pos < right:
                            g[fill_i][pos] = c
```
(This detects frames accurately in most cases but has flawed filling logic: even-spaced from right works for some colors (e.g., 6 fills 3 bars at 6,8,10 correctly; 4 fills 2 at 7,9 but expected needs 8,10) but fails for others (e.g., 2 fills 1 extra bar; 1 intends 2 but often skips due to detection issues); partially helpful for detection, but modify filling for accuracy.)

No other functions provided; no types or extraction tools (e.g., no object extraction like bounding boxes for digits—would be helpful for verifying patterns but absent; consider adding in future to analyze per-frame shapes independently).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt shows good understanding of background detection and small component erasure (preserves frames in all training examples without accidental removal).
 * Frame detection works well: correctly identifies top/bottom bars of span=11 with borders, validates 2+ vertical rows with clean inner bg, and confirms bottom—passes ex1 fully, detects all frames in ex2/ex3/test.
 * Filling partially works: for c=6 in ex2, correctly adds 3 internal bars (positions 6,8,10 in second vertical row, matching expected full-ish middle); for c=4 in ex2/ex3/test, adds 2 bars (e.g., positions 7,9 for start=1, but expected has 8,10—close but offset wrong, still better than nothing).
 * What didn't work in ex2 (color 1 frame, rows 2-6): detected frame but failed to fill second vertical row (row 4) at position 10 (expected 1 at cols 2,10,12; generated only 2,12—missing middle bar near right; likely due to inner_bg failing from pre-existing partial fills or num_v detection glitch, as m=2 should fill 8 and 10 but did neither).
 * What didn't work in ex3 (all frames): overfills second vertical rows with extra bars not in expected—e.g., for c=2 (rows 1-5), fills col 9 in row 3 (generated has 2 at 1,9,11; expected only 1,11); for c=4 (rows 7-11), fills cols 7,9 in row 9 (generated 1,7,9,11; expected likely 1,8,10,11 or similar partial); for c=1 (rows 13-17? wait, rows 13-17 is c=1, but generated row 15 has only sides at 1,11, missing expected middle like col 10; underfill similar to ex2); for c=2 again? Wait ex3 has c=2 top, c=4 mid, c=1 bottom—consistent over/underfill mismatch.
 * erase_small_components is helpful and correct (no issues observed; doesn't erase valid frame parts >=12 cells).
 * detect_and_complete_frames is partially broken in filling rule (even-from-right spacing wrong for low c like 1/2/3; e.g., for c=2 m=1 fills too far left at right-2, but expected often no fill or right-only; for c=1 special m=2 but detection often skips fill entirely—unknown why, perhaps strict inner_bg on partial input); still essential for core detection.
 * No unhelpful functions, but the fixed span=11 and h-4 range assume uniform frame size/height—works here but brittle if varies; no handling for pre-filled internals breaking detection.
 * Train1 correct overall (likely simple frame with matching fill pattern).
 * Train2 mismatches internal bar positions for c=1 (missing fill at col10 in row4; generated lacks it despite rule intending 2 fills).
 * Train3 has systematic overfill in second vertical rows for c=2/4 (extra bars at col9/7 etc.), underfill for c=1 (no middle bars added).
 * No object extraction function present—would help analyze per-color patterns (e.g., count needed bars per digit); consider adding to avoid hardcoding fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same flaws from training examples 2/3: inconsistent filling patterns that overfill some frames and underfill others, leading to incomplete or distorted shapes.
 * For top frame (c=2, rows 1-5, start=1, left=1/right=11): fills 1 bar at col9 in second vertical row (row3), generating 2 at cols 1,9,11 (plus right 11); but based on ex3's c=2 expected (only sides at 1,11 in second vertical), this adds an unneeded bar at 9—overfill, likely wrong (expected probably no middle fill for "2" shape).
 * For second frame (c=4, rows 7-11): fills 2 bars at cols 7,9 in row9 (second vertical), generating 4 at 1,7,9,11; but ex2/ex3 for c=4 expected partial middle like 1,8,10,11—offset wrong (7/9 vs 8/10), adds extras or misplaces, distorting shape.
 * For third frame (c=3, rows 13-17): fills 1 bar at col9 in row15, generating 3 at 1,9,11; likely overfill, as low c=3 probably needs minimal middle (e.g., right-only like "3" shape with short horizontal)—extra at9 mismatches training patterns for similar low colors.
 * For bottom frame (c=1, rows 19-23): no fill in row21 (second vertical), generating only sides at 1,11; but ex2 for c=1 expected additional near-right bar (e.g., at 10)—underfill, same issue as training2 (skipped despite m=2 rule; unknown if detection failed inner_bg or num_v<2 due to input partials).
 * Overall, test makes sense as output of this program (detects all 4 frames, applies flawed rule), but not correct for puzzle—shapes look "completed" but wrongly (e.g., too many internal bars for 2/3/4, too few for 1), probably failing to form intended digits; to fix, need color-specific fill positions (e.g., for c=1 fill only right-2; for c=2 no fill; adjust spacing/starting point).

[2025-10-01 19:26:24] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties that show consistent interactions or effects across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). Only obvious, direct connections are included—based on matching changes in color, holes, pixels, and positions that occur identically in every case. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., exact tiny positions, which vary by input; semantic meanings like "movement"; or one-off shapes like crosses/L-shapes in the third example's description, which do not appear in the data) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., how specific small shapes are assigned to frames) are noted as such rather than speculated. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is provided.

#### Core Components
- **Background**: Large bbox covering the full grid (e.g., [0,0,22,22] or [0,0,22,19]), high pixels (e.g., 265-337 input), variable holes (8-12 input), color shared with all inners (e.g., Blue in train 1, Maroon in train 2, Green in train 3).
- **Frames**: Three stacked rectangular outlines (top ~[1,1,11,5], middle ~[1,7,11,11], bottom ~[1,13,11,17]; holes=1, pixels=28, various colors like Yellow/Red/Maroon/Pink/Blue). Unchanged in every output.
- **Inners**: One per frame, filling inside frame bbox (e.g., ~[2,2,10,4] for top), holes=0 input, pixels=27 input, color = background color.
- **Small standalone shapes**: Scattered h=0 shapes with small bbox (width/height 1-3), low pixels (2-8), various colors (e.g., Green/Yellow/Maroon/Pink/Red/Blue). Present in inputs only; disappear in all outputs.
- **Tiny dots**: Emerge in outputs only; h=0, pixels=1, small bbox (single cell, e.g., [7,3,7,3]), color = corresponding frame's color, positioned inside inner's bbox (y often inner_y1 +1 or +2; x varies).

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects (Across All Trains)
1. **Small standalone shapes ↔ Background (pixels transfer)**:
   - Input small shapes' total pixels are added directly to background pixels in output (e.g., +28 in train 1 matching sum of 9 smalls' pixels; +27 in train 2 matching 8 smalls; +30 in train 3 matching 5 smalls).
   - All small shapes disappear entirely in outputs (no remnants or transformations outside this effect).
   - Background color unchanged (remains = inner color).
   - Background holes always set to exactly 3 in outputs (decreases from input 8-12; consistent fixed value, no other pattern).

2. **Small standalone shapes ↔ Inners (via tiny dots; holes and pixels effect)**:
   - Each small shape assigned to a frame produces exactly 1 tiny dot inside that frame's inner in output (number of tinies per inner = number of assigned smalls; e.g., top inner gets 2 tinies in train 1, 1 in train 2, 0 in train 3).
   - Assignment rule (which smalls target which frame) is unknown—varies by input (e.g., based on position/color?); not consistent or identifiable here.
   - Per tiny dot: Inner holes +1, inner pixels -1 (e.g., train 1 middle inner: +4 holes/-4 pixels for 4 tinies; train 3 bottom inner: +2/-2 for 2 tinies; unaffected inners like train 3 top: +0/-0, no tinies).
   - Inner color unchanged (= background color).
   - Tiny dots always placed spatially inside inner's bbox (consistent containment; exact x/y varies, e.g., clustered near center or spread, but always within inner bounds).

3. **Frames ↔ Tiny dots (color effect)**:
   - Tiny dot color always = frame color of the targeted frame (e.g., Yellow tinies for Yellow frame in train 1 top and train 3 middle; Pink tinies for Pink frame in train 2 middle; no exceptions).
   - Frames themselves unaffected (holes=1, pixels=28 unchanged; no direct interaction with smalls or background).

4. **Inners ↔ Background (shared property)**:
   - All inners always start with color = background color (consistent in every input; e.g., all Blue in train 1, all Maroon in train 2).
   - No other direct effects (e.g., inner holes/pixels do not transfer to background).

#### Notes on Inconsistencies/Unknowns
- Tiny dot positions within inners are not consistent (e.g., x=3/5/7/9 in train 1 middle vs. x=8/10 in train 2 bottom; always inside but no fixed pattern).
- Total tiny count per output varies (7 in train 1, 6 in train 2, 4 in train 3) but always = total small shapes (after assignment).
- No interactions involving frame positions → transformations or hole count → color (e.g., frame colors do not change inners or background).
- Elements like standalone smalls' input colors do not consistently affect outputs (e.g., input Green smalls produce non-Green tinies; color ignored except for assignment unknown).
- No consistent effects from bbox positions across components (e.g., small y-position does not always predict inner y for tinies).

[2025-10-01 19:28:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple incomplete rectangular "frames" (likely representing digits or symbols in a bar-based display like seven-segment, but boxed), where each frame uses a distinct non-background color. The goal is to identify the background color, remove small noise components, detect these frames based on top/bottom horizontal bars and side verticals, and complete missing internal horizontal bars in the appropriate row (typically the second vertical row) with a color-specific pattern to form complete shapes, without altering existing structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all processing treats it as empty space.
 * Small connected components (4-directional adjacency) of non-background cells smaller than 12 cells should be erased to background, as they represent noise; larger components are presumed part of valid frames/digits.
 * Frames are fixed-size: horizontal bars are exactly 11 cells long, bordered on left/right by background or grid edge; vertical sides must align perfectly with these bars, with all inner cells (between left/right) being background for validity.
 * Detection requires: a top horizontal bar, at least 2 consecutive valid vertical rows below it (sides present, inner background), followed immediately by a matching bottom horizontal bar; frames are scanned starting from each possible top row (up to h-4 to allow space).
 * Completion happens only in the row where the second valid vertical is detected (fill_i); no filling in other rows, even if more vertical rows exist (e.g., some frames have 3 vertical rows, but fill only targets the second).
 * Filling pattern is color-dependent: m = c // 2 (special case m=2 for c=1); place m evenly spaced bars (every 2 cells) from the right edge inward, only if position is strictly between left and right (no overwriting sides); this aims to complete internal horizontal segments specific to the "digit" implied by color, but patterns vary (e.g., full middle bar for some like 6/0/8, partial for 2/3/4/5, minimal/none for 1/7).
 * Subtlety: Vertical validation (is_v and inner_bg) is strict—any non-background in inner cells during vertical rows breaks detection; bottom bar must have clean borders like top.
 * Frames do not overlap and are horizontally aligned starting at varying columns (e.g., col 1 or 2), with rest of grid as background; multiple frames stack vertically with background rows separating them.
 * Easy to miss: For some colors (e.g., 1,2), the expected pattern has fewer or differently positioned internal bars than the even-from-right rule; overfilling adds unwanted bars (e.g., in color 2's second vertical row), underfilling misses needed ones (e.g., in color 1); existing bars in input may already partially fill, but code overwrites to c if matching pattern.
 * No rotation, diagonal connections, or non-rectangular shapes; all frames are axis-aligned boxes ~5 rows high (top + 2-3 verticals + bottom).
 * After processing, output the modified grid; no further cleanup or symmetry enforcement.
 * Considerations across attempts: Color-specific patterns are not uniform (e.g., 4 needs bars at positions like 8,10,12 but code fills 7,9 for start=1); detection may fail if vertical rows have pre-existing internal non-bg (breaking inner_bg); small components threshold of 12 works for noise but might erase valid partial bars if <12; scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) matters for overlapping detections (though none observed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 8 in ex2/test, 3 in ex3; essential first step.)

```python
def erase_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] == bg:
                continue
            component = []
            q = deque([(i, j)])
            visited[i][j] = True
            color = g[i][j]
            while q:
                x, y = q.popleft()
                component.append((x, y))
                for dx, dy in dirs:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                        visited[nx][ny] = True
                        q.append((nx, ny))
            if len(component) < 12:
                for x, y in component:
                    g[x][y] = bg
```
(This correctly removes noise smaller than 12 connected cells of same color; works well in all examples, preserving frame structures; uses BFS for components—helpful and not broken.)

```python
def detect_and_complete_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> None:

            left = start
            right = start + span - 1
            border_left = left == 0 or g[i][left - 1] == bg
            border_right = right == w - 1 or g[i][right + 1] == bg
            if not (border_left and border_right):
                continue
            num_v = 0
            fill_i = -1
            j = i + 1
            while j < h:
                is_v = g[j][left] == c and g[j][right] == c
                inner_bg = all(g[j][k] == bg for k in range(left + 1, right))
                if is_v and inner_bg:
                    num_v += 1
                    if num_v == 2:
                        fill_i = j
                    j += 1
                else:

            bottom_border_right = right == w - 1 or g[j][right + 1] == bg
            if is_bottom and bottom_border_left and bottom_border_right:
                if fill_i != -1:
                    m = c // 2
                    if c == 1:
                        m = 2
                    for kk in range(1, m + 1):
                        pos = right - 2 * kk
                        if left < pos < right:
                            g[fill_i][pos] = c
```
(This detects frames accurately in most cases but has flawed filling logic: even-spaced from right works for some colors (e.g., 6 fills 3 bars at 6,8,10 correctly; 4 fills 2 at 7,9 but expected needs 8,10) but fails for others (e.g., 2 fills 1 extra bar; 1 intends 2 but often skips due to detection issues); partially helpful for detection, but modify filling for accuracy.)

No other functions provided; no types or extraction tools (e.g., no object extraction like bounding boxes for digits—would be helpful for verifying patterns but absent; consider adding in future to analyze per-frame shapes independently).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt shows good understanding of background detection and small component erasure (preserves frames in all training examples without accidental removal).
 * Frame detection works well: correctly identifies top/bottom bars of span=11 with borders, validates 2+ vertical rows with clean inner bg, and confirms bottom—passes ex1 fully, detects all frames in ex2/ex3/test.
 * Filling partially works: for c=6 in ex2, correctly adds 3 internal bars (positions 6,8,10 in second vertical row, matching expected full-ish middle); for c=4 in ex2/ex3/test, adds 2 bars (e.g., positions 7,9 for start=1, but expected has 8,10—close but offset wrong, still better than nothing).
 * What didn't work in ex2 (color 1 frame, rows 2-6): detected frame but failed to fill second vertical row (row 4) at position 10 (expected 1 at cols 2,10,12; generated only 2,12—missing middle bar near right; likely due to inner_bg failing from pre-existing partial fills or num_v detection glitch, as m=2 should fill 8 and 10 but did neither).
 * What didn't work in ex3 (all frames): overfills second vertical rows with extra bars not in expected—e.g., for c=2 (rows 1-5), fills col 9 in row 3 (generated has 2 at 1,9,11; expected only 1,11); for c=4 (rows 7-11), fills cols 7,9 in row 9 (generated 1,7,9,11; expected likely 1,8,10,11 or similar partial); for c=1 (rows 13-17? wait, rows 13-17 is c=1, but generated row 15 has only sides at 1,11, missing expected middle like col 10; underfill similar to ex2); for c=2 again? Wait ex3 has c=2 top, c=4 mid, c=1 bottom—consistent over/underfill mismatch.
 * erase_small_components is helpful and correct (no issues observed; doesn't erase valid frame parts >=12 cells).
 * detect_and_complete_frames is partially broken in filling rule (even-from-right spacing wrong for low c like 1/2/3; e.g., for c=2 m=1 fills too far left at right-2, but expected often no fill or right-only; for c=1 special m=2 but detection often skips fill entirely—unknown why, perhaps strict inner_bg on partial input); still essential for core detection.
 * No unhelpful functions, but the fixed span=11 and h-4 range assume uniform frame size/height—works here but brittle if varies; no handling for pre-filled internals breaking detection.
 * Train1 correct overall (likely simple frame with matching fill pattern).
 * Train2 mismatches internal bar positions for c=1 (missing fill at col10 in row4; generated lacks it despite rule intending 2 fills).
 * Train3 has systematic overfill in second vertical rows for c=2/4 (extra bars at col9/7 etc.), underfill for c=1 (no middle bars added).
 * No object extraction function present—would help analyze per-color patterns (e.g., count needed bars per digit); consider adding to avoid hardcoding fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same flaws from training examples 2/3: inconsistent filling patterns that overfill some frames and underfill others, leading to incomplete or distorted shapes.
 * For top frame (c=2, rows 1-5, start=1, left=1/right=11): fills 1 bar at col9 in second vertical row (row3), generating 2 at cols 1,9,11 (plus right 11); but based on ex3's c=2 expected (only sides at 1,11 in second vertical), this adds an unneeded bar at 9—overfill, likely wrong (expected probably no middle fill for "2" shape).
 * For second frame (c=4, rows 7-11): fills 2 bars at cols 7,9 in row9 (second vertical), generating 4 at 1,7,9,11; but ex2/ex3 for c=4 expected partial middle like 1,8,10,11—offset wrong (7/9 vs 8/10), adds extras or misplaces, distorting shape.
 * For third frame (c=3, rows 13-17): fills 1 bar at col9 in row15, generating 3 at 1,9,11; likely overfill, as low c=3 probably needs minimal middle (e.g., right-only like "3" shape with short horizontal)—extra at9 mismatches training patterns for similar low colors.
 * For bottom frame (c=1, rows 19-23): no fill in row21 (second vertical), generating only sides at 1,11; but ex2 for c=1 expected additional near-right bar (e.g., at 10)—underfill, same issue as training2 (skipped despite m=2 rule; unknown if detection failed inner_bg or num_v<2 due to input partials).
 * Overall, test makes sense as output of this program (detects all 4 frames, applies flawed rule), but not correct for puzzle—shapes look "completed" but wrongly (e.g., too many internal bars for 2/3/4, too few for 1), probably failing to form intended digits; to fix, need color-specific fill positions (e.g., for c=1 fill only right-2; for c=2 no fill; adjust spacing/starting point).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells) of non-background colors are erased to the background, and then specific "frame" structures made of erased colors are completed by filling symmetric patterns inside their vertical border rows, likely representing windows or panels with color-coded internal designs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent color in the grid.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same color; only non-bg components smaller than 12 cells are erased, and their colors are tracked in a set (small_colors) for later use in completing frames.
 * Frames are detected starting from potential top horizontal bars: exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (where c is in small_colors) in a row, fully bordered on left/right by bg or grid edge; no partial or longer bars are considered.
 * Immediately below the top bar, there must be at least 2 consecutive "v-rows" (vertical border rows): each with c only at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the bar span, and all inner positions (between left+1 and right-1) must be bg; the loop continues counting consecutive v-rows beyond 2 but breaks on non-v-row, and filling only triggers if >=2 v-rows found.
 * Immediately after the final v-row, there must be a matching bottom horizontal bar (11 cells of c, bordered left/right by bg or edge).
 * Filling occurs only in the row index of the exact 2nd v-row (fill_i set when num_v reaches 2), placing c cells at inner positions calculated as right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m (symmetric every-other-column pattern from near the right edge, skipping the sides and bg inners); m = c // 2 by default, but special override for c==1 sets m = num_v - 2 (where num_v is the total consecutive v-rows found, which can exceed 2).
 * Only frames of colors in small_colors are completed (skips others, e.g., no filling in color 2 frames if 2 had no small components erased).
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 20x23 in training3, taller in test); scanning for top bars starts from row 0 to h-4 (to allow space for top + 2 v + bottom), and horizontally from col 0 to w-11.
 * Subtle: In examples, frames for different colors have 3 consecutive v-rows (e.g., top bar, v1, v2 (fill row), v3, bottom bar), but filling is always in v2 regardless of total num_v; the every-other fill pattern starts from right-2 (e.g., for span left=1/right=11, fills col9 then col7 for m=2, leaving col10/8/6/etc as bg).
 * Subtle: For c=1, the special m = num_v - 2 with num_v=3 yields m=1 (fills only col9), but this mismatches expectation (needs m=2 to fill col9 and col7); possibly c=1 should always use m=2, or m = (c + something)//2, or fill based on num_v independently of c.
 * Subtle: No overlapping frame detection or handling; each potential top bar is checked independently, which could lead to multiple completions in complex grids.
 * Subtle: After erasing small components, the grid is modified in-place, so v-row inners must remain bg (not affected by prior erasures); bars must be fully solid post-erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Borders can be grid edges (no need for bg beyond), but inners in v-rows must be strictly bg; span is hardcoded to 11, suggesting fixed frame width in the puzzle.
 * Easy to miss: num_v counts all consecutive v-rows (can be >2), but fill_i locks to the 2nd; for c!=1, m ignores num_v.
 * Considerations across attempts: No blob extraction beyond BFS in erase_small; no handling for non-frame small colors or vertical/horizontal variations; assumes all frames are horizontal-bar based with fixed span; test grid is taller (28 rows?), potentially with multiple frames stacked vertically, risking over-completion if partial structures exist.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it correctly erases small components (<12 cells) and uses small_colors to selectively complete frames, passing training examples 1 and 2 fully.
 * Successfully detects frames with 3 v-rows and fills correctly for c=4 (m=2, places c at col7 and col9 in 2nd v-row, matching expected symmetric every-other pattern from right).
 * Correctly skips filling for c=2 frame (no inner placements, as expected), likely because 2 not in small_colors (no small 2-components erased).
 * Fails training3 for c=1 frame: generates 1's only at col1,9,11 in row15 (2nd v-row, m=1 fills only col9 + sides), but expected 1's at col1,7,9,11 (needs m=2 to also fill col7); difference is missing inner 1 at col7, due to special c=1 rule yielding m=1 (with num_v=3) instead of m=2.
 * No issues with bar detection or bordering in training3 (top/bottom bars and v-rows match expected structure post-fill).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt (no prior attempts shown, but if from earlier, a general blob extractor would be similar to erase_small's BFS and helpful for debugging components, but not essential here as frames are structure-based, not arbitrary blobs).
 * The complete_frames function is mostly correct but broken for c=1 filling amount (under-fills by one position); the every-other pattern logic works but hardcoded span=11 limits flexibility.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; erase_small is precise and relevant, complete_frames is core but needs c=1 fix (e.g., hardcode m=2 for c=1 or adjust formula to m = max(c//2, 2) or m = (num_v -1)//1 for c=1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (applies same logic as training: fills c=4 frame with two inners at col7/9 in 2nd v-row row9; fills c=3 frame with one inner at col9 in 2nd v-row row15, m=3//2=1; fills two separate c=1 frames, each with one inner at col9 in their 2nd v-rows rows21 and ?—wait, bottom frame rows19 top,20 v1,21 v2 (fill),22 v3,23 bottom).
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to training3 error, c=1 fillings under-fill (only col9 + sides per frame, but likely needs col7/9 + sides like expected in training3, suggesting same m=1 bug); for c=3 (odd like1), only one fill (col9) may be wrong if rule intends m=2 or more for odds (unknown without expected, but pattern mismatch risk). Most critically, it over-completes an unexpected second full 1 frame at rows19-23 (with fill in row21), plus extra all-bg rows at end—this likely shouldn't happen if test input had only partial/unintended structure there (e.g., no top/bottom bars or not in small_colors), indicating code falsely detects/completes non-frame artifacts; top c=2 frame correctly has no fill (skipped, as in training). Overall, demonstrates core frame detection but fails on fill count for specials (1 and possibly3) and risks false positives in taller grids with stacked elements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells of the same non-background color) are erased to the background color (most common color, typically 8), and then incomplete "frame" or "window" structures are detected and completed by filling specific internal patterns in the second vertical support row of the frame, based on the color value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flat grid (e.g., 8); all other colors are potential objects.
 * Erase only connected components (4-directional adjacency) of size <12; larger ones stay intact. Erased cells are set to bg and tracked per color for potential later use (e.g., counting erased positions in specific rows).
 * Frames are rectangular structures spanning exactly 11 columns (span=11): a full top bar row of the color (all 11 cells same, bordered left/right by bg or edge), preceded by a full bg row above; followed by exactly two "vertical" rows (sides at left/right columns are color, internals bg); then a full bottom bar row (same as top, bordered); followed by a full bg row below.
 * Filling happens only in the second vertical row: sides (left/right) are already color (or partially), internals start as bg (possibly with some erased remnants).
 * Filling pattern: Place color in internal positions starting from the right, every 2 columns inward, for a number of positions m determined by color c: for c>1, m = c // 2; for c=1, special logic attempts m=2 minus count of already-erased (but non-bg?) positions in that row's internals, but this is buggy and leads to under-filling.
 * Subtlety: Detection must ensure exact structure (no extra rows, precise bordering, consecutive verticals exactly 2); frames don't overlap or nest in examples.
 * After erasing, some vertical rows may have partial internals already (erased small bits), but filling overrides to bg implicitly? No, code fills on bg or erased.
 * Min_size=12 is fixed; span=11 fixed for bars.
 * Grids are 23x23 in examples (h=23,w=23?), with frames aligned starting from various columns but often offset by 2 (e.g., cols 2-12).
 * For c=1, expected filling seems to place 1 internal (e.g., near right), but code's special case fails to match, possibly due to incorrect erased_count (counts erased positions but may include non-relevant or overcount).
 * Higher c fill more internals (e.g., c=6 fills 3 internals at positions right-2, right-4, right-6).
 * No filling in first vertical row; only second.
 * Erasure happens first, potentially removing small parts of frames, making completion necessary.
 * Potential miss: Frames must have above_bg and below_bg rows fully bg in the span; vertical rows must have exactly sides color and internals bg before filling.
 * Colors are low integers (1-6 in examples); no rotation or other symmetries.
 * Test input has multiple stacked frames (colors 4,3,1,2 from top? No, 2 top, then4,3,1 bottom), all with similar incomplete seconds V rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque, defaultdict
from typing import List, Dict

# Good: Standard flood-fill to find and erase small components (<12), tracks erased positions per color.
def erase_small(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int, small_colors: set, erased: Dict[int, List[tuple]]) -> None:
    # Uses BFS/deque for components, 4 dirs, marks visited, collects component list.
    # If len < min_size, add color to small_colors, append positions to erased[color], set to bg.
    # Essential for initial cleanup; works correctly in all trains.
```
```python
# Helpful but buggy: Detects frames and attempts filling in second V row.
# Core logic for frame detection (top bar, above_bg, verticals count==2, bottom bar, below_bg) is solid and works for trains 1/3.
# Filling logic partial: for c>1, m=c//2, fills right-2*kk for kk=1 to m (every 2 cols from right inward).
# For c=1, special m=2 - erased_count (counts erased in internals of that row), but erased_count often wrong (e.g., counts 1 but should be 0?), leading to m=1 but wrong position or underfill.
# Also, for c=1 fills only if m>0, positions only internals (left < pos < right).
def complete_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, small_colors: set, erased: Dict[int, List[tuple]], h: int, w: int) -> None:
    # Loops over possible top rows i (h-4), start cols (w-span+1).
    # Checks c in small_colors (erased color), above_bg full span, top bar full c, borders.
    # Counts consecutive V rows (sides c, internals bg), requires >=2, tracks fill_i as second V row.
    # Checks bottom bar at j, borders, below_bg.
    # Then fills in fill_i row: for c==1 special erased_count in internals, m=2-erased_count; else m=c//2.
    # Fills g[fill_i][pos]=c for pos=right-2*kk, if internal.
```
```python
# Basic but useful: Main program wrapper.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes bg via Counter on flat.
    # Copies g to work_g.
    # Calls erase_small with min_size=12.
    # Then complete_frames.
    # Returns work_g (modified copy).
    # Works end-to-end for trains 1/3.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; no prior ones shown.
 * Worked: Training example 1 and 3 fully correct (likely simple frames with c>1 or no c=1 issues, proper erasure and filling matched expected).
 * Did not work: Training example 2 incorrect—under-filled internals in second V rows for all colors, but especially c=1 (generated row4 for c=1: only sides col2:1 and col12:1, no internal; expected: sides + col10:1, so missing one internal). For c=4 row16: generated only sides + ? (code should fill col8:4,col10:4 but output shows missing col8/col10? Wait, generated matches expected for c=4/6 visually in print but user marked INCORRECT—possible print error or subtle diff in c=1/6; specifically, for c=6 row10 generated misses col6:6 and col8:6 (only sides + col10?:6? but print shows only sides col2:6 col12:6); expected has col2:6, col6:6, col8:6, col10:6, col12:6. For c=4 similar underfill. Reason unknown but likely m=c//2 undercounts or filling loop skips (e.g., pos not internal). For c=1, special erased_count=1 (perhaps counting a pre-erased cell wrong), m=1, but fills wrong pos (right-2=col10, but generated didn't place it).
 * erase_small is correct and essential (properly identifies/erases small components without touching large frames).
 * complete_frames frame detection works (finds positions correctly for trains 1/3), but filling buggy: special c=1 logic broken (erased_count miscounts, e.g., includes side or non-internal); for c>1, may skip if pos==side or out of bounds subtly; doesn't handle if first V row has remnants affecting detection.
 * No unhelpful functions shown; all are relevant but filling needs fix (e.g., unify m= max(1, c//2) or pattern-based, not erased-dependent; for c=1 always fill 1 at right-2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, mirroring train2's under-filling issues (likely buggy filling logic applied consistently).
 * Generated shows erasure happened (no small blobs left), and partial frame completion: e.g., for top frame c=2 (rows1-5, cols1-11), second V row2? Wait row3 (0-index? row3:[8,2,8x7,2,8,2,8x...] has sides col1:2 col11:2 + internal col9:2 (right-2=9), but for m=2//2=1 correct per code, but expected likely needs 1 or 2 internals (e.g., col7:2 and/or col9:2 for "2" pattern?); similar for c=4 rows7-11 cols1-11, second V row9? Wait row10:[8,4,8x5,4,8,4,8,4,8x] wait col1:4, col7:4? (after 5 8's col2-6, col7:4, col8:8 col9:4 col10:8 col11:4—yes col7,9 filled for m=2, matches expected pattern like train2 c=4). For c=3 rows13-17 cols1-11, second V row15:[8,3,8x7,3,8,3,8x] col1:3, col9:3, col11:3 (m=1 at col9, likely underfill if expected col7,9). For c=1 rows19-23 cols1-11, second V row21:[8,1,8x7,1,8,1,8x] similar col1:1 col9:1 col11:1 (special m=1? at col9, but train2 suggests expected only/more at col10 or col8+10, so mismatched position/underfill). Overall, fills every-2-from-right but wrong count/pos for low c (1,2,3); looks like train2 failure extended (underfills internals, e.g., c=1/2/3 get only 1 internal vs. expected 1-2; c=4 gets correct 2). Does not match expected (unknown but inferred from train2: more internals for low c, precise positions).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties that show consistent interactions or effects across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). Only obvious, direct connections are included—based on matching changes in color, holes, pixels, and positions that occur identically in every case. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., exact tiny positions, which vary by input; semantic meanings like "movement"; or one-off shapes like crosses/L-shapes in the third example's description, which do not appear in the data) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., how specific small shapes are assigned to frames) are noted as such rather than speculated. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is provided.

#### Core Components
- **Background**: Large bbox covering the full grid (e.g., [0,0,22,22] or [0,0,22,19]), high pixels (e.g., 265-337 input), variable holes (8-12 input), color shared with all inners (e.g., Blue in train 1, Maroon in train 2, Green in train 3).
- **Frames**: Three stacked rectangular outlines (top ~[1,1,11,5], middle ~[1,7,11,11], bottom ~[1,13,11,17]; holes=1, pixels=28, various colors like Yellow/Red/Maroon/Pink/Blue). Unchanged in every output.
- **Inners**: One per frame, filling inside frame bbox (e.g., ~[2,2,10,4] for top), holes=0 input, pixels=27 input, color = background color.
- **Small standalone shapes**: Scattered h=0 shapes with small bbox (width/height 1-3), low pixels (2-8), various colors (e.g., Green/Yellow/Maroon/Pink/Red/Blue). Present in inputs only; disappear in all outputs.
- **Tiny dots**: Emerge in outputs only; h=0, pixels=1, small bbox (single cell, e.g., [7,3,7,3]), color = corresponding frame's color, positioned inside inner's bbox (y often inner_y1 +1 or +2; x varies).

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects (Across All Trains)
1. **Small standalone shapes ↔ Background (pixels transfer)**:
   - Input small shapes' total pixels are added directly to background pixels in output (e.g., +28 in train 1 matching sum of 9 smalls' pixels; +27 in train 2 matching 8 smalls; +30 in train 3 matching 5 smalls).
   - All small shapes disappear entirely in outputs (no remnants or transformations outside this effect).
   - Background color unchanged (remains = inner color).
   - Background holes always set to exactly 3 in outputs (decreases from input 8-12; consistent fixed value, no other pattern).

2. **Small standalone shapes ↔ Inners (via tiny dots; holes and pixels effect)**:
   - Each small shape assigned to a frame produces exactly 1 tiny dot inside that frame's inner in output (number of tinies per inner = number of assigned smalls; e.g., top inner gets 2 tinies in train 1, 1 in train 2, 0 in train 3).
   - Assignment rule (which smalls target which frame) is unknown—varies by input (e.g., based on position/color?); not consistent or identifiable here.
   - Per tiny dot: Inner holes +1, inner pixels -1 (e.g., train 1 middle inner: +4 holes/-4 pixels for 4 tinies; train 3 bottom inner: +2/-2 for 2 tinies; unaffected inners like train 3 top: +0/-0, no tinies).
   - Inner color unchanged (= background color).
   - Tiny dots always placed spatially inside inner's bbox (consistent containment; exact x/y varies, e.g., clustered near center or spread, but always within inner bounds).

3. **Frames ↔ Tiny dots (color effect)**:
   - Tiny dot color always = frame color of the targeted frame (e.g., Yellow tinies for Yellow frame in train 1 top and train 3 middle; Pink tinies for Pink frame in train 2 middle; no exceptions).
   - Frames themselves unaffected (holes=1, pixels=28 unchanged; no direct interaction with smalls or background).

4. **Inners ↔ Background (shared property)**:
   - All inners always start with color = background color (consistent in every input; e.g., all Blue in train 1, all Maroon in train 2).
   - No other direct effects (e.g., inner holes/pixels do not transfer to background).

#### Notes on Inconsistencies/Unknowns
- Tiny dot positions within inners are not consistent (e.g., x=3/5/7/9 in train 1 middle vs. x=8/10 in train 2 bottom; always inside but no fixed pattern).
- Total tiny count per output varies (7 in train 1, 6 in train 2, 4 in train 3) but always = total small shapes (after assignment).
- No interactions involving frame positions → transformations or hole count → color (e.g., frame colors do not change inners or background).
- Elements like standalone smalls' input colors do not consistently affect outputs (e.g., input Green smalls produce non-Green tinies; color ignored except for assignment unknown).
- No consistent effects from bbox positions across components (e.g., small y-position does not always predict inner y for tinies).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:37:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where cells are colored with numbers (e.g., 8 as background), involving noise removal of small connected components and completion of incomplete rectangular frames (boxes) by filling missing horizontal patterns in their middle rows based on the frame's color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color across the entire flattened grid.
 * Connected components are 4-directional (orthogonal neighbors only, no diagonals) groups of the same non-background color.
 * Erase (set to background) any connected component smaller than 12 cells, and mark its color as "small" to allow it for frame detection but ignore larger blobs.
 * Frames are specifically 11 cells wide (fixed span), starting from non-background cells in upper rows; top and bottom bars must be full horizontal runs of color c, bordered on left/right by background or grid edge.
 * After a top bar, exactly two "vertical" rows must follow: each with c only at left and right edges, and all inner cells (between left+1 and right-1) as background; the second of these is the fill row.
 * Immediately after the two vertical rows, a matching bottom bar.
 * Filling in the second vertical row: compute m = c // 2, but special case for c=1 where m=2 if starting column index is odd (start % 2 == 1) else m=1; place c at inner positions calculated as right - 2 * kk for kk=1 to m (e.g., skips every other cell inward from right side).
 * Detection scans row-by-row from top, left-to-right, but only considers small colors for frames to avoid treating large structures as frames.
 * Subtleties: Vertical checks stop if not exactly two clean verticals before bottom; no filling if num_v < 2 or no bottom; assumes frames don't overlap or nest; fixed span=11 means only that width is handled; parity for c=1 depends on start column (0-based index); inner fill positions must be strictly between left and right to avoid overwriting sides.
 * Easy to miss: Borders must be checked (edge or bg adjacent); components must be same-color only; if a frame has extra cells, it might not detect cleanly; no diagonal connectivity; erasing small components happens before detection, so noise doesn't interfere.
 * All frames in test are aligned starting at column 1 (odd), affecting c=1 rule; no rotation or varying widths; output is the modified grid with erasures and fills applied in-place.

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Finds the most common color as background; essential and correct.)

```python
def erase_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int, small_colors: Set[int]) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for si in range(h):
        for sj in range(w):
            if visited[si][sj] or g[si][sj] == bg:
                continue
            q = deque([(si, sj)])
            visited[si][sj] = True
            component = [(si, sj)]
            color = g[si][sj]
            while q:
                ci, cj = q.popleft()
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni = ci + di
                    nj = cj + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == color:
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        q.append((ni, nj))

                for x, y in component:
                    g[x][y] = bg

(Uses BFS to find and erase small same-color components; tracks small colors for later use; min_size=12 is key; modifies grid in-place; helpful and correct for noise removal.)

```
(Detects frames and fills middles; handles exact structure checks, borders, and color-specific patterns; span=11 fixed; modifies in-place; core to solving and correct.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = find_background(g)
    work_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    small_colors: Set[int] = set()
    erase_small_components(work_g, bg, 12, small_colors)
    detect_and_complete_frames(work_g, bg, small_colors)
    return work_g
```
(Orchestrates the full process; copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential wrapper.)

No custom types defined, but Set[int] for small_colors and List[List[int]] for grid are used effectively. No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant and working.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it succeeded on all three training examples (correct outputs).
 * Erase_small_components correctly identifies and removes noise <12 cells without affecting large frames.
 * detect_and_complete_frames properly detects the exact frame structure (top + 2 verticals + bottom) and applies color-specific fills without overfilling or missing borders.
 * For c=1 special case, parity check (start % 2) is handled correctly.
 * No misses observed: training passed fully; no unknown mismatches in shapes or omissions.
 * All functions are helpful and not broken; no irrelevant ones to avoid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense, as it shows four completed frames (colors 1,2,3,4) with noise erased (no small components visible) and middles filled per rules.
 * Specific effects: Background 8 dominates; frames start at column 1 (left=1, right=11, span=11).
   - Color 2 (rows ~1-5): m=1, filled one c at col9 in second vertical row (row ~3); sides and bars intact, inner bg elsewhere.
   - Color 4 (rows ~7-11): m=2, filled two c's at col7 and col9 in second vertical row (row ~9); matches every-other spacing from right.
   - Color 3 (rows ~13-17): m=1, filled one c at col9 in second vertical row (row ~15).
   - Color 1 (rows ~19-23): c=1 special, start=1 odd so m=2, filled two c's at col7 and col9 in second vertical row (row ~21).
 * No differences from expected: Fills are precisely at calculated positions (right - 2*kk), only inner, no side overwrites; vertical rows have clean bg inners pre-fill; bottom bars match tops; extra 8's in unused areas (rows 0,6,12,18,24-25) are bg.
 * If input had unfilled middles and no small noise, this exactly completes them; no unexpected changes (e.g., no erased frames, no extra fills).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 19:37:28] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 19:38:55] Response:
- **Background (large encompassing component, variable color B, high initial holes, large pixel count, full-scene bbox like [0,0,22,22] or similar)** interacts with **scattered small peripheral components (small bbox, low pixels ≤8, positions outside nested frames, various colors)**: absorption occurs consistently, where background pixels increase by the total pixels of all absorbed small components, and background holes decrease by 1 per absorbed small component (consistent across all examples; results in background holes=3 in training examples due to input counts, but mechanism is per-component reduction).
- **Nested outer frame components (color C ≠ B, holes=1, pixels=28, rectangular bbox ~[1,y,11,y+4])** interact with their paired **inner fill components (color B matching background, holes=0, pixels=27, bbox ~[2,y+1,10,y+3] nested inside outer)**: outer injects k (variable, 0-4 in examples) 1-pixel components of color C into the inner at central positions (e.g., middle y-row of inner, x-positions like 7/9 or 6/8/10 within inner width); effects inner holes +=k and inner pixels -=k (punching mechanism); outer unchanged; consistent mechanism across all levels and examples (k=0 leaves inner unchanged, as in train3 top level).
- **Inner fill color property** consistently matches **background color property** (B) across all levels within an example (e.g., all blue in train1, all maroon in train2, all green in train3); no transformation changes this color match.
- **Position property of nested levels** (vertical stacking at y-ranges like 1-5/7-11/13-17, gaps at even y=6/12/etc.) shows no direct interaction or transformation; levels operate independently (no cross-level color/position/hole effects observed consistently).
- **Injected small components (1 pixel, color C of outer, positions central in inner bbox)** become new separate components post-injection; their placement is position-dependent (inner bbox -> specific x/y offsets) but count k is unknown (varies, no consistent driver identifiable from data).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no color propagation between levels, no position-based transformations outside described mechanisms, no effects on outers, no consistent role for peripheral small colors/shapes beyond absorption; bg hole final count=3 coincidental to input small counts in training, not a forced interaction).

[2025-10-01 19:38:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple incomplete rectangular "frames" (likely representing digits or symbols in a bar-based display like seven-segment, but boxed), where each frame uses a distinct non-background color. The goal is to identify the background color, remove small noise components, detect these frames based on top/bottom horizontal bars and side verticals, and complete missing internal horizontal bars in the appropriate row (typically the second vertical row) with a color-specific pattern to form complete shapes, without altering existing structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all processing treats it as empty space.
 * Small connected components (4-directional adjacency) of non-background cells smaller than 12 cells should be erased to background, as they represent noise; larger components are presumed part of valid frames/digits.
 * Frames are fixed-size: horizontal bars are exactly 11 cells long, bordered on left/right by background or grid edge; vertical sides must align perfectly with these bars, with all inner cells (between left/right) being background for validity.
 * Detection requires: a top horizontal bar, at least 2 consecutive valid vertical rows below it (sides present, inner background), followed immediately by a matching bottom horizontal bar; frames are scanned starting from each possible top row (up to h-4 to allow space).
 * Completion happens only in the row where the second valid vertical is detected (fill_i); no filling in other rows, even if more vertical rows exist (e.g., some frames have 3 vertical rows, but fill only targets the second).
 * Filling pattern is color-dependent: m = c // 2 (special case m=2 for c=1); place m evenly spaced bars (every 2 cells) from the right edge inward, only if position is strictly between left and right (no overwriting sides); this aims to complete internal horizontal segments specific to the "digit" implied by color, but patterns vary (e.g., full middle bar for some like 6/0/8, partial for 2/3/4/5, minimal/none for 1/7).
 * Subtlety: Vertical validation (is_v and inner_bg) is strict—any non-background in inner cells during vertical rows breaks detection; bottom bar must have clean borders like top.
 * Frames do not overlap and are horizontally aligned starting at varying columns (e.g., col 1 or 2), with rest of grid as background; multiple frames stack vertically with background rows separating them.
 * Easy to miss: For some colors (e.g., 1,2), the expected pattern has fewer or differently positioned internal bars than the even-from-right rule; overfilling adds unwanted bars (e.g., in color 2's second vertical row), underfilling misses needed ones (e.g., in color 1); existing bars in input may already partially fill, but code overwrites to c if matching pattern.
 * No rotation, diagonal connections, or non-rectangular shapes; all frames are axis-aligned boxes ~5 rows high (top + 2-3 verticals + bottom).
 * After processing, output the modified grid; no further cleanup or symmetry enforcement.
 * Considerations across attempts: Color-specific patterns are not uniform (e.g., 4 needs bars at positions like 8,10,12 but code fills 7,9 for start=1); detection may fail if vertical rows have pre-existing internal non-bg (breaking inner_bg); small components threshold of 12 works for noise but might erase valid partial bars if <12; scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) matters for overlapping detections (though none observed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 8 in ex2/test, 3 in ex3; essential first step.)

```python
def erase_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] == bg:
                continue
            component = []
            q = deque([(i, j)])
            visited[i][j] = True
            color = g[i][j]
            while q:
                x, y = q.popleft()
                component.append((x, y))
                for dx, dy in dirs:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                        visited[nx][ny] = True
                        q.append((nx, ny))
            if len(component) < 12:
                for x, y in component:
                    g[x][y] = bg
```
(This correctly removes noise smaller than 12 connected cells of same color; works well in all examples, preserving frame structures; uses BFS for components—helpful and not broken.)

            if not (border_left and border_right):

            j = i + 1
            while j < h:
                is_v = g[j][left] == c and g[j][right] == c
                inner_bg = all(g[j][k] == bg for k in range(left + 1, right))
                if is_v and inner_bg:
                    num_v += 1
                    if num_v == 2:

```
(This detects frames accurately in most cases but has flawed filling logic: even-spaced from right works for some colors (e.g., 6 fills 3 bars at 6,8,10 correctly; 4 fills 2 at 7,9 but expected needs 8,10) but fails for others (e.g., 2 fills 1 extra bar; 1 intends 2 but often skips due to detection issues); partially helpful for detection, but modify filling for accuracy.)

No other functions provided; no types or extraction tools (e.g., no object extraction like bounding boxes for digits—would be helpful for verifying patterns but absent; consider adding in future to analyze per-frame shapes independently).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt shows good understanding of background detection and small component erasure (preserves frames in all training examples without accidental removal).
 * Frame detection works well: correctly identifies top/bottom bars of span=11 with borders, validates 2+ vertical rows with clean inner bg, and confirms bottom—passes ex1 fully, detects all frames in ex2/ex3/test.
 * Filling partially works: for c=6 in ex2, correctly adds 3 internal bars (positions 6,8,10 in second vertical row, matching expected full-ish middle); for c=4 in ex2/ex3/test, adds 2 bars (e.g., positions 7,9 for start=1, but expected has 8,10—close but offset wrong, still better than nothing).
 * What didn't work in ex2 (color 1 frame, rows 2-6): detected frame but failed to fill second vertical row (row 4) at position 10 (expected 1 at cols 2,10,12; generated only 2,12—missing middle bar near right; likely due to inner_bg failing from pre-existing partial fills or num_v detection glitch, as m=2 should fill 8 and 10 but did neither).
 * What didn't work in ex3 (all frames): overfills second vertical rows with extra bars not in expected—e.g., for c=2 (rows 1-5), fills col 9 in row 3 (generated has 2 at 1,9,11; expected only 1,11); for c=4 (rows 7-11), fills cols 7,9 in row 9 (generated 1,7,9,11; expected likely 1,8,10,11 or similar partial); for c=1 (rows 13-17? wait, rows 13-17 is c=1, but generated row 15 has only sides at 1,11, missing expected middle like col 10; underfill similar to ex2); for c=2 again? Wait ex3 has c=2 top, c=4 mid, c=1 bottom—consistent over/underfill mismatch.
 * erase_small_components is helpful and correct (no issues observed; doesn't erase valid frame parts >=12 cells).
 * detect_and_complete_frames is partially broken in filling rule (even-from-right spacing wrong for low c like 1/2/3; e.g., for c=2 m=1 fills too far left at right-2, but expected often no fill or right-only; for c=1 special m=2 but detection often skips fill entirely—unknown why, perhaps strict inner_bg on partial input); still essential for core detection.
 * No unhelpful functions, but the fixed span=11 and h-4 range assume uniform frame size/height—works here but brittle if varies; no handling for pre-filled internals breaking detection.
 * Train1 correct overall (likely simple frame with matching fill pattern).
 * Train2 mismatches internal bar positions for c=1 (missing fill at col10 in row4; generated lacks it despite rule intending 2 fills).
 * Train3 has systematic overfill in second vertical rows for c=2/4 (extra bars at col9/7 etc.), underfill for c=1 (no middle bars added).
 * No object extraction function present—would help analyze per-color patterns (e.g., count needed bars per digit); consider adding to avoid hardcoding fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same flaws from training examples 2/3: inconsistent filling patterns that overfill some frames and underfill others, leading to incomplete or distorted shapes.
 * For top frame (c=2, rows 1-5, start=1, left=1/right=11): fills 1 bar at col9 in second vertical row (row3), generating 2 at cols 1,9,11 (plus right 11); but based on ex3's c=2 expected (only sides at 1,11 in second vertical), this adds an unneeded bar at 9—overfill, likely wrong (expected probably no middle fill for "2" shape).
 * For second frame (c=4, rows 7-11): fills 2 bars at cols 7,9 in row9 (second vertical), generating 4 at 1,7,9,11; but ex2/ex3 for c=4 expected partial middle like 1,8,10,11—offset wrong (7/9 vs 8/10), adds extras or misplaces, distorting shape.
 * For third frame (c=3, rows 13-17): fills 1 bar at col9 in row15, generating 3 at 1,9,11; likely overfill, as low c=3 probably needs minimal middle (e.g., right-only like "3" shape with short horizontal)—extra at9 mismatches training patterns for similar low colors.
 * For bottom frame (c=1, rows 19-23): no fill in row21 (second vertical), generating only sides at 1,11; but ex2 for c=1 expected additional near-right bar (e.g., at 10)—underfill, same issue as training2 (skipped despite m=2 rule; unknown if detection failed inner_bg or num_v<2 due to input partials).
 * Overall, test makes sense as output of this program (detects all 4 frames, applies flawed rule), but not correct for puzzle—shapes look "completed" but wrongly (e.g., too many internal bars for 2/3/4, too few for 1), probably failing to form intended digits; to fix, need color-specific fill positions (e.g., for c=1 fill only right-2; for c=2 no fill; adjust spacing/starting point).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells) of non-background colors are erased to the background, and then specific "frame" structures made of erased colors are completed by filling symmetric patterns inside their vertical border rows, likely representing windows or panels with color-coded internal designs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent color in the grid.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same color; only non-bg components smaller than 12 cells are erased, and their colors are tracked in a set (small_colors) for later use in completing frames.
 * Frames are detected starting from potential top horizontal bars: exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (where c is in small_colors) in a row, fully bordered on left/right by bg or grid edge; no partial or longer bars are considered.
 * Immediately below the top bar, there must be at least 2 consecutive "v-rows" (vertical border rows): each with c only at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the bar span, and all inner positions (between left+1 and right-1) must be bg; the loop continues counting consecutive v-rows beyond 2 but breaks on non-v-row, and filling only triggers if >=2 v-rows found.
 * Immediately after the final v-row, there must be a matching bottom horizontal bar (11 cells of c, bordered left/right by bg or edge).
 * Filling occurs only in the row index of the exact 2nd v-row (fill_i set when num_v reaches 2), placing c cells at inner positions calculated as right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m (symmetric every-other-column pattern from near the right edge, skipping the sides and bg inners); m = c // 2 by default, but special override for c==1 sets m = num_v - 2 (where num_v is the total consecutive v-rows found, which can exceed 2).
 * Only frames of colors in small_colors are completed (skips others, e.g., no filling in color 2 frames if 2 had no small components erased).
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 20x23 in training3, taller in test); scanning for top bars starts from row 0 to h-4 (to allow space for top + 2 v + bottom), and horizontally from col 0 to w-11.
 * Subtle: In examples, frames for different colors have 3 consecutive v-rows (e.g., top bar, v1, v2 (fill row), v3, bottom bar), but filling is always in v2 regardless of total num_v; the every-other fill pattern starts from right-2 (e.g., for span left=1/right=11, fills col9 then col7 for m=2, leaving col10/8/6/etc as bg).
 * Subtle: For c=1, the special m = num_v - 2 with num_v=3 yields m=1 (fills only col9), but this mismatches expectation (needs m=2 to fill col9 and col7); possibly c=1 should always use m=2, or m = (c + something)//2, or fill based on num_v independently of c.
 * Subtle: No overlapping frame detection or handling; each potential top bar is checked independently, which could lead to multiple completions in complex grids.
 * Subtle: After erasing small components, the grid is modified in-place, so v-row inners must remain bg (not affected by prior erasures); bars must be fully solid post-erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Borders can be grid edges (no need for bg beyond), but inners in v-rows must be strictly bg; span is hardcoded to 11, suggesting fixed frame width in the puzzle.
 * Easy to miss: num_v counts all consecutive v-rows (can be >2), but fill_i locks to the 2nd; for c!=1, m ignores num_v.
 * Considerations across attempts: No blob extraction beyond BFS in erase_small; no handling for non-frame small colors or vertical/horizontal variations; assumes all frames are horizontal-bar based with fixed span; test grid is taller (28 rows?), potentially with multiple frames stacked vertically, risking over-completion if partial structures exist.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it correctly erases small components (<12 cells) and uses small_colors to selectively complete frames, passing training examples 1 and 2 fully.
 * Successfully detects frames with 3 v-rows and fills correctly for c=4 (m=2, places c at col7 and col9 in 2nd v-row, matching expected symmetric every-other pattern from right).
 * Correctly skips filling for c=2 frame (no inner placements, as expected), likely because 2 not in small_colors (no small 2-components erased).
 * Fails training3 for c=1 frame: generates 1's only at col1,9,11 in row15 (2nd v-row, m=1 fills only col9 + sides), but expected 1's at col1,7,9,11 (needs m=2 to also fill col7); difference is missing inner 1 at col7, due to special c=1 rule yielding m=1 (with num_v=3) instead of m=2.
 * No issues with bar detection or bordering in training3 (top/bottom bars and v-rows match expected structure post-fill).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt (no prior attempts shown, but if from earlier, a general blob extractor would be similar to erase_small's BFS and helpful for debugging components, but not essential here as frames are structure-based, not arbitrary blobs).
 * The complete_frames function is mostly correct but broken for c=1 filling amount (under-fills by one position); the every-other pattern logic works but hardcoded span=11 limits flexibility.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; erase_small is precise and relevant, complete_frames is core but needs c=1 fix (e.g., hardcode m=2 for c=1 or adjust formula to m = max(c//2, 2) or m = (num_v -1)//1 for c=1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (applies same logic as training: fills c=4 frame with two inners at col7/9 in 2nd v-row row9; fills c=3 frame with one inner at col9 in 2nd v-row row15, m=3//2=1; fills two separate c=1 frames, each with one inner at col9 in their 2nd v-rows rows21 and ?—wait, bottom frame rows19 top,20 v1,21 v2 (fill),22 v3,23 bottom).
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to training3 error, c=1 fillings under-fill (only col9 + sides per frame, but likely needs col7/9 + sides like expected in training3, suggesting same m=1 bug); for c=3 (odd like1), only one fill (col9) may be wrong if rule intends m=2 or more for odds (unknown without expected, but pattern mismatch risk). Most critically, it over-completes an unexpected second full 1 frame at rows19-23 (with fill in row21), plus extra all-bg rows at end—this likely shouldn't happen if test input had only partial/unintended structure there (e.g., no top/bottom bars or not in small_colors), indicating code falsely detects/completes non-frame artifacts; top c=2 frame correctly has no fill (skipped, as in training). Overall, demonstrates core frame detection but fails on fill count for specials (1 and possibly3) and risks false positives in taller grids with stacked elements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells of the same non-background color) are erased to the background color (most common color, typically 8), and then incomplete "frame" or "window" structures are detected and completed by filling specific internal patterns in the second vertical support row of the frame, based on the color value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flat grid (e.g., 8); all other colors are potential objects.
 * Erase only connected components (4-directional adjacency) of size <12; larger ones stay intact. Erased cells are set to bg and tracked per color for potential later use (e.g., counting erased positions in specific rows).
 * Frames are rectangular structures spanning exactly 11 columns (span=11): a full top bar row of the color (all 11 cells same, bordered left/right by bg or edge), preceded by a full bg row above; followed by exactly two "vertical" rows (sides at left/right columns are color, internals bg); then a full bottom bar row (same as top, bordered); followed by a full bg row below.
 * Filling happens only in the second vertical row: sides (left/right) are already color (or partially), internals start as bg (possibly with some erased remnants).
 * Filling pattern: Place color in internal positions starting from the right, every 2 columns inward, for a number of positions m determined by color c: for c>1, m = c // 2; for c=1, special logic attempts m=2 minus count of already-erased (but non-bg?) positions in that row's internals, but this is buggy and leads to under-filling.
 * Subtlety: Detection must ensure exact structure (no extra rows, precise bordering, consecutive verticals exactly 2); frames don't overlap or nest in examples.
 * After erasing, some vertical rows may have partial internals already (erased small bits), but filling overrides to bg implicitly? No, code fills on bg or erased.
 * Min_size=12 is fixed; span=11 fixed for bars.
 * Grids are 23x23 in examples (h=23,w=23?), with frames aligned starting from various columns but often offset by 2 (e.g., cols 2-12).
 * For c=1, expected filling seems to place 1 internal (e.g., near right), but code's special case fails to match, possibly due to incorrect erased_count (counts erased positions but may include non-relevant or overcount).
 * Higher c fill more internals (e.g., c=6 fills 3 internals at positions right-2, right-4, right-6).
 * No filling in first vertical row; only second.
 * Erasure happens first, potentially removing small parts of frames, making completion necessary.
 * Potential miss: Frames must have above_bg and below_bg rows fully bg in the span; vertical rows must have exactly sides color and internals bg before filling.
 * Colors are low integers (1-6 in examples); no rotation or other symmetries.
 * Test input has multiple stacked frames (colors 4,3,1,2 from top? No, 2 top, then4,3,1 bottom), all with similar incomplete seconds V rows.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; no prior ones shown.
 * Worked: Training example 1 and 3 fully correct (likely simple frames with c>1 or no c=1 issues, proper erasure and filling matched expected).
 * Did not work: Training example 2 incorrect—under-filled internals in second V rows for all colors, but especially c=1 (generated row4 for c=1: only sides col2:1 and col12:1, no internal; expected: sides + col10:1, so missing one internal). For c=4 row16: generated only sides + ? (code should fill col8:4,col10:4 but output shows missing col8/col10? Wait, generated matches expected for c=4/6 visually in print but user marked INCORRECT—possible print error or subtle diff in c=1/6; specifically, for c=6 row10 generated misses col6:6 and col8:6 (only sides + col10?:6? but print shows only sides col2:6 col12:6); expected has col2:6, col6:6, col8:6, col10:6, col12:6. For c=4 similar underfill. Reason unknown but likely m=c//2 undercounts or filling loop skips (e.g., pos not internal). For c=1, special erased_count=1 (perhaps counting a pre-erased cell wrong), m=1, but fills wrong pos (right-2=col10, but generated didn't place it).
 * erase_small is correct and essential (properly identifies/erases small components without touching large frames).
 * complete_frames frame detection works (finds positions correctly for trains 1/3), but filling buggy: special c=1 logic broken (erased_count miscounts, e.g., includes side or non-internal); for c>1, may skip if pos==side or out of bounds subtly; doesn't handle if first V row has remnants affecting detection.
 * No unhelpful functions shown; all are relevant but filling needs fix (e.g., unify m= max(1, c//2) or pattern-based, not erased-dependent; for c=1 always fill 1 at right-2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, mirroring train2's under-filling issues (likely buggy filling logic applied consistently).
 * Generated shows erasure happened (no small blobs left), and partial frame completion: e.g., for top frame c=2 (rows1-5, cols1-11), second V row2? Wait row3 (0-index? row3:[8,2,8x7,2,8,2,8x...] has sides col1:2 col11:2 + internal col9:2 (right-2=9), but for m=2//2=1 correct per code, but expected likely needs 1 or 2 internals (e.g., col7:2 and/or col9:2 for "2" pattern?); similar for c=4 rows7-11 cols1-11, second V row9? Wait row10:[8,4,8x5,4,8,4,8,4,8x] wait col1:4, col7:4? (after 5 8's col2-6, col7:4, col8:8 col9:4 col10:8 col11:4—yes col7,9 filled for m=2, matches expected pattern like train2 c=4). For c=3 rows13-17 cols1-11, second V row15:[8,3,8x7,3,8,3,8x] col1:3, col9:3, col11:3 (m=1 at col9, likely underfill if expected col7,9). For c=1 rows19-23 cols1-11, second V row21:[8,1,8x7,1,8,1,8x] similar col1:1 col9:1 col11:1 (special m=1? at col9, but train2 suggests expected only/more at col10 or col8+10, so mismatched position/underfill). Overall, fills every-2-from-right but wrong count/pos for low c (1,2,3); looks like train2 failure extended (underfills internals, e.g., c=1/2/3 get only 1 internal vs. expected 1-2; c=4 gets correct 2). Does not match expected (unknown but inferred from train2: more internals for low c, precise positions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where cells are colored with numbers (e.g., 8 as background), involving noise removal of small connected components and completion of incomplete rectangular frames (boxes) by filling missing horizontal patterns in their middle rows based on the frame's color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color across the entire flattened grid.
 * Connected components are 4-directional (orthogonal neighbors only, no diagonals) groups of the same non-background color.
 * Erase (set to background) any connected component smaller than 12 cells, and mark its color as "small" to allow it for frame detection but ignore larger blobs.
 * Frames are specifically 11 cells wide (fixed span), starting from non-background cells in upper rows; top and bottom bars must be full horizontal runs of color c, bordered on left/right by background or grid edge.
 * After a top bar, exactly two "vertical" rows must follow: each with c only at left and right edges, and all inner cells (between left+1 and right-1) as background; the second of these is the fill row.
 * Immediately after the two vertical rows, a matching bottom bar.
 * Filling in the second vertical row: compute m = c // 2, but special case for c=1 where m=2 if starting column index is odd (start % 2 == 1) else m=1; place c at inner positions calculated as right - 2 * kk for kk=1 to m (e.g., skips every other cell inward from right side).
 * Detection scans row-by-row from top, left-to-right, but only considers small colors for frames to avoid treating large structures as frames.
 * Subtleties: Vertical checks stop if not exactly two clean verticals before bottom; no filling if num_v < 2 or no bottom; assumes frames don't overlap or nest; fixed span=11 means only that width is handled; parity for c=1 depends on start column (0-based index); inner fill positions must be strictly between left and right to avoid overwriting sides.
 * Easy to miss: Borders must be checked (edge or bg adjacent); components must be same-color only; if a frame has extra cells, it might not detect cleanly; no diagonal connectivity; erasing small components happens before detection, so noise doesn't interfere.
 * All frames in test are aligned starting at column 1 (odd), affecting c=1 rule; no rotation or varying widths; output is the modified grid with erasures and fills applied in-place.

(Uses BFS to find and erase small same-color components; tracks small colors for later use; min_size=12 is key; modifies grid in-place; helpful and correct for noise removal.)

(Detects frames and fills middles; handles exact structure checks, borders, and color-specific patterns; span=11 fixed; modifies in-place; core to solving and correct.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = find_background(g)
    work_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    small_colors: Set[int] = set()
    erase_small_components(work_g, bg, 12, small_colors)
    detect_and_complete_frames(work_g, bg, small_colors)
    return work_g
```
(Orchestrates the full process; copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential wrapper.)

No custom types defined, but Set[int] for small_colors and List[List[int]] for grid are used effectively. No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant and working.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it succeeded on all three training examples (correct outputs).
 * Erase_small_components correctly identifies and removes noise <12 cells without affecting large frames.
 * detect_and_complete_frames properly detects the exact frame structure (top + 2 verticals + bottom) and applies color-specific fills without overfilling or missing borders.
 * For c=1 special case, parity check (start % 2) is handled correctly.
 * No misses observed: training passed fully; no unknown mismatches in shapes or omissions.
 * All functions are helpful and not broken; no irrelevant ones to avoid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense, as it shows four completed frames (colors 1,2,3,4) with noise erased (no small components visible) and middles filled per rules.
 * Specific effects: Background 8 dominates; frames start at column 1 (left=1, right=11, span=11).
   - Color 2 (rows ~1-5): m=1, filled one c at col9 in second vertical row (row ~3); sides and bars intact, inner bg elsewhere.
   - Color 4 (rows ~7-11): m=2, filled two c's at col7 and col9 in second vertical row (row ~9); matches every-other spacing from right.
   - Color 3 (rows ~13-17): m=1, filled one c at col9 in second vertical row (row ~15).
   - Color 1 (rows ~19-23): c=1 special, start=1 odd so m=2, filled two c's at col7 and col9 in second vertical row (row ~21).
 * No differences from expected: Fills are precisely at calculated positions (right - 2*kk), only inner, no side overwrites; vertical rows have clean bg inners pre-fill; bottom bars match tops; extra 8's in unused areas (rows 0,6,12,18,24-25) are bg.
 * If input had unfilled middles and no small noise, this exactly completes them; no unexpected changes (e.g., no erased frames, no extra fills).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Background (large encompassing component, variable color B, high initial holes, large pixel count, full-scene bbox like [0,0,22,22] or similar)** interacts with **scattered small peripheral components (small bbox, low pixels ≤8, positions outside nested frames, various colors)**: absorption occurs consistently, where background pixels increase by the total pixels of all absorbed small components, and background holes decrease by 1 per absorbed small component (consistent across all examples; results in background holes=3 in training examples due to input counts, but mechanism is per-component reduction).
- **Nested outer frame components (color C ≠ B, holes=1, pixels=28, rectangular bbox ~[1,y,11,y+4])** interact with their paired **inner fill components (color B matching background, holes=0, pixels=27, bbox ~[2,y+1,10,y+3] nested inside outer)**: outer injects k (variable, 0-4 in examples) 1-pixel components of color C into the inner at central positions (e.g., middle y-row of inner, x-positions like 7/9 or 6/8/10 within inner width); effects inner holes +=k and inner pixels -=k (punching mechanism); outer unchanged; consistent mechanism across all levels and examples (k=0 leaves inner unchanged, as in train3 top level).
- **Inner fill color property** consistently matches **background color property** (B) across all levels within an example (e.g., all blue in train1, all maroon in train2, all green in train3); no transformation changes this color match.
- **Position property of nested levels** (vertical stacking at y-ranges like 1-5/7-11/13-17, gaps at even y=6/12/etc.) shows no direct interaction or transformation; levels operate independently (no cross-level color/position/hole effects observed consistently).
- **Injected small components (1 pixel, color C of outer, positions central in inner bbox)** become new separate components post-injection; their placement is position-dependent (inner bbox -> specific x/y offsets) but count k is unknown (varies, no consistent driver identifiable from data).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no color propagation between levels, no position-based transformations outside described mechanisms, no effects on outers, no consistent role for peripheral small colors/shapes beyond absorption; bg hole final count=3 coincidental to input small counts in training, not a forced interaction).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 19:45:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where small connected components of non-background colors are erased, and incomplete rectangular frame-like structures (made of small colors) are detected and partially completed with internal patterns based on the color value, likely to form symmetric or patterned fillings within the frames.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid (here, 8), and all processing preserves it while targeting non-background colors.
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), and only those with size <12 cells are erased to background; their colors are marked as "small" to allow frame detection on them later—note that erasing happens in-place on a copy, but only small ones, so large structures persist.
 * Frames are detected starting from horizontal "bars" of exactly 11 consecutive cells of a small color, bordered by background or edges on left/right; then check for exactly 2 rows of vertical sides (same color at left/right ends, with inner cells all background), followed by a bottom bar matching the top (11 cells, bordered).
 * Filling occurs only in the second vertical row (fill_i = position of second vertical), with a pattern dependent on color c: m = c//2, but special case for c=1 where m=2 if start col is odd, else 1; places c at positions right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m, if within left+1 to right-1 (creating every-other or spaced dots from the right).
 * Subtleties: Detection starts from row i in range(h-4), scans horizontally for starts; vertical check stops at first non-matching row; requires j < h after verticals for bottom check; no filling if num_v <2 or no bottom; frames must be isolated (bordered); small colors are only erased if their full component <12, but frames use remaining small color segments.
 * Key missable elements: The span is hardcoded to 11 (suggesting frames are 12 cells wide including borders? but inner fill is 9 cells wide effectively); filling is asymmetric (starts from right, every 2 steps); for c=1, parity of start col affects density (odd start -> denser); no diagonal connectivity; no overlapping frame detection or post-fill cleanup; assumes frames are axis-aligned and exactly 4 rows high (top + 2 verts + bottom); erased small components might leave fragments that don't trigger frames.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle multiple frames vertically stacked or separated by background rows; filling only happens if exactly 2 vertical rows are clean (inner bg); program works on copy to avoid mutating input; colors like 1-4 seem to represent different fill densities (1 sparse/dense variant, 2 single dot, 3 maybe 1 dot? but code uses //2 so 3//2=1, 4//2=2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List, Set

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies bg as most common, e.g., 8; useful for all processing.)

```python
def erase_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int, small_colors: Set[int]) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for si in range(h):
        for sj in range(w):
            if visited[si][sj] or g[si][sj] == bg:
                continue
            q = deque([(si, sj)])
            visited[si][sj] = True
            component = [(si, sj)]
            color = g[si][sj]
            while q:
                ci, cj = q.popleft()
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni = ci + di
                    nj = cj + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == color:
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        q.append((ni, nj))
                        component.append((ni, nj))
            if len(component) < min_size:

                for x, y in component:
                    g[x][y] = bg
```
(This is core for flood-fill component sizing/erasure; tracks small colors for later frame use; min_size=12 is key threshold; modifies g in-place.)

```
(This detects and fills frames; hardcoded span=11 and exact 2 vertical rows are crucial; filling logic is color-specific and right-aligned spaced; modifies g in-place.)

(The main program ties them together: copies grid, erases smalls, then completes frames, returns copy. No other functions like object extraction are present or needed, as component finding is embedded.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating good grasp of background detection, small component erasure (size<12), and basic frame completion for those cases.
 * What worked: Erasure correctly removes tiny blobs without touching large structures; frame detection triggers on bordered 11-span bars with exactly 2 clean verticals and a bottom, filling the second vertical row appropriately (e.g., for c=2, m=1, adds one internal dot from right).
 * What didn't work: No prior misses to note, but potential gaps include no handling for frames wider/narrower than 11-span (hardcoded), no filling if >2 verticals or irregular inners, asymmetric right-only filling might miss left-symmetric patterns, and special c=1 parity rule might fail if start col parity is misaligned in some grids.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions; all provided are relevant and functional, though frame detection could miss non-11 spans or overlapping frames.
 * Training examples likely had simple small erasures and standard frames, which this nailed; no noted mismatches in shapes or omissions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves four large vertical blocks (rows ~1-5 for color 2, ~7-11 for 4, ~13-17 for 3, ~19-23 for 1), each ~12 cells wide (cols 1-12), separated by background rows of 8's, on a 25x23 grid with bg=8 dominant.
 * Each block shows: full top/bottom rows of the color (12 cells, e.g., [8, c,c,...,c, 8,...] with 11 c's? but printed as 12 including edges? wait, lines show 12 c's from col1-12), partial side verticals (e.g., for 2: row2 has 2 at col1 and col12, inners 8; row3 has 2 at col1, some 8's, 2 at col11? wait, printed as [8,2,8,8,...,8,2,8,...] suggesting incomplete sides), and minimal internal fills in the second vertical row (e.g., for 1 in row22: [8,1,8's, then 1 at ~col8?,1 at col10?,1 at col12? but pattern is spaced from right).
 * Observed effects: No erasures happened (structures >12 cells, so intact); frame completion added sparse internal dots in the second row of each (e.g., color 4 row9 has extra 4's at col7,9,11? suggesting m=2, positions right-2,right-4; color 1 row22 has three 1's spaced, suggesting m=2 from odd start parity); but sides remain incomplete/gappy (e.g., row3 for 2 has isolated 2 at col11, not full vertical), and no dense fills or symmetry completion.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have cleaner/completed frames with symmetric or full internal patterns (e.g., for c=4, perhaps 2 dots per side or denser; for c=1, full every-other across inner 9 cells if dense variant), but generated has only right-aligned sparse fills and leaves side gaps unfilled—likely because detection requires perfect clean verticals (inner all bg), but test input probably has noisy/gappy sides, so no filling triggers, or partial detection only fills one row. This doesn't fully "complete" frames (e.g., color 3 row16 has no visible fills, just [8,3,8's,3,8's] suggesting m=1 but maybe missed); overall, output looks partially processed but incomplete/asymmetric, not matching a "solved" puzzle where frames would be symmetrically filled or sides repaired—unknown if input had small components to erase, but none appear erased.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** provided train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to elements/properties that demonstrably affect or transform each other in every case, based on shared attributes like color, count, position, holes, or pixels. I have excluded:
- Any high-level puzzle solution or hypothesis.
- Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific pixel values of small shapes beyond total aggregation; background bbox variations; non-interacting small shapes like greens in example 1 without frames).
- Inconsistent interactions (e.g., no reliable position-based movement of small shapes to specific frames beyond color matching; no consistent effect from small shape sizes/pixels on addition count; no cross-frame interactions).
- Forced or unclear connections (e.g., unknown reasons for background holes always becoming exactly 3; no identifiable semantic meaning like symbols affecting transformations, as data shows only blob properties).

Interactions are described as pairs or chains of affecting elements (e.g., A -> B means A affects/transforms B). Only properties with direct, observable effects are included.

#### 1. **Small Standalone Squares (Outside Frames) -> Frame Interiors (via Matching Frame Border Color)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small standalone squares (h=0, scattered positions outside frames, various colors/sizes, p=1-8 typically); frame borders (h=1, p=28, fixed stacked positions like [1,1,11,5]/[1,7,11,11]/[1,13,11,17]); interiors (h=0 initially, p=27, inset positions like [2,2,10,4]/[2,8,10,10]/[2,14,10,16], color matching background).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Number of small standalone components (count of separate blobs, regardless of their individual p or bbox) of a specific color -> number of new 1-pixel squares (h=0, p=1, 1x1 bbox) created inside the interior of the frame border matching that color.
       - Example: In all cases, if a frame border is yellow and there are N yellow small components outside, exactly N yellow 1-pixel squares appear inside its interior.
       - Consistent across all: Addition only occurs for colors matching a frame border; 0 matching small components -> 0 added (e.g., red frame in train 3 has 0 red small -> no addition).
     - Position effect: Added 1-pixel squares consistently appear inside the matching interior's bbox (inset from border), arranged horizontally in a centered row (e.g., x-positions like 7/9 or 6/8/10 within interior x=2-10/12, at vertical center y of interior).
     - No effect if no matching frame border color (e.g., green/red small in train 2 contribute nothing to interiors).
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Exact reason for addition count being component count (not total p or position); no consistent transformation of original small p into added squares (added always p=1 each).

#### 2. **Added 1-Pixel Squares Inside Interiors -> Interior Properties (Holes and Pixels)**
   - **Components Involved**: New 1-pixel squares (h=0, p=1, color matching frame border, positioned inside interior); interiors (h=0 initially, p=27, same color as background).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Each added 1-pixel square -> +1 hole to the interior (h increases by the number of added squares); -1 pixel to the interior (p decreases by the number of added squares).
       - Total conservation: Interior p + (number added × 1) = original 27 in all cases (e.g., h=2, p=25 + 2×1 = 27).
     - Color effect: Added squares always match the frame border color (different from interior color), creating color-based contrast inside.
     - Consistent across all: Unchanged interiors (0 added) retain h=0, p=27; no overflow or boundary effects on interior bbox.
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Why holes increase exactly by addition count (no other hole sources); no effect on interior color or bbox.

#### 3. **All Small Standalone Squares (Outside Frames) -> Background (Pixels)**
   - **Components Involved**: All small standalone squares (h=0, scattered, all colors, all p values); background (h=high like 8-14, p=265-360, full bbox like [0,0,22,22], color matching interiors).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Total pixels (sum of p across all small standalone components, regardless of color, size, or position) -> + that total to background p (background p increases exactly by this sum).
       - Example: Train 1 small total p=28 -> background p=336 +28=364; train 2 total p=27 ->337+27=364; train 3 total p=30 ->265+30=295.
     - All small standalone components disappear entirely (not listed in outputs).
     - Color consistency: No color change to background; remains matching interior color.
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Why total p (not count or color) affects background; no consistent effect on background bbox (minor variations like y=19 vs. 22).

#### 4. **Background -> Background (Holes, Independent of Other Elements)**
   - **Components Involved**: Background (h=high initially, full bbox, color matching interiors).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Background holes -> set to exactly 3 (regardless of initial h=8/11/12/14 or any other changes).
     - No direct tie to other elements' holes/pixels (e.g., not summing frame holes or small counts).
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Reason for fixed h=3 (possibly tied to number of frames=3, but unconfirmed as test has 4 frames); no effect on background color or p beyond the small pixels addition.

#### 5. **Interiors <-> Background (Color Consistency)**
   - **Components Involved**: All interiors (h=0 initially, p=27, inset bboxes); background (h=high, full bbox).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - All interiors share the same color -> background adopts/ retains exactly that color (no change in inputs or outputs).
       - Consistent across all: Blue interiors/bg in train 1; maroon in train 2; green in train 3.
     - No pixel or hole sharing between them (interiors transform independently per frame).
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Why interiors all match background color initially; no position or transformation effects between them.

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No Other Consistent Interactions Identified**: 
  - Frame borders do not directly affect interiors (beyond enabling color-matched additions); no hole/pixel changes to borders (always h=1, p=28).
  - No consistent movement/transformation based on small positions (e.g., top vs. bottom small do not preferentially go to top/bottom frames; only color matters).
  - Symbols/L-shapes (+, ×, etc.) mentioned in prompt not observable in data (all small are simple h=0 blobs; no consistent shape properties like edges/silhouettes affecting count or placement).
  - Test input follows same structure (4 frames, matching interior/bg color=maroon, small colors including frame matches like 4 yellow/2 red/1 green/1 blue), but no output provided, so not used for patterns.
- **Data Limitations**: Connections based solely on provided properties (color, h, bbox, p); no forced assumptions on unobservable visuals (e.g., no "movement" implied beyond disappearance/addition). If a transformation lacks explanation (e.g., background h=3), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

[2025-10-01 19:47:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple incomplete rectangular "frames" (likely representing digits or symbols in a bar-based display like seven-segment, but boxed), where each frame uses a distinct non-background color. The goal is to identify the background color, remove small noise components, detect these frames based on top/bottom horizontal bars and side verticals, and complete missing internal horizontal bars in the appropriate row (typically the second vertical row) with a color-specific pattern to form complete shapes, without altering existing structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all processing treats it as empty space.
 * Small connected components (4-directional adjacency) of non-background cells smaller than 12 cells should be erased to background, as they represent noise; larger components are presumed part of valid frames/digits.
 * Frames are fixed-size: horizontal bars are exactly 11 cells long, bordered on left/right by background or grid edge; vertical sides must align perfectly with these bars, with all inner cells (between left/right) being background for validity.
 * Detection requires: a top horizontal bar, at least 2 consecutive valid vertical rows below it (sides present, inner background), followed immediately by a matching bottom horizontal bar; frames are scanned starting from each possible top row (up to h-4 to allow space).
 * Completion happens only in the row where the second valid vertical is detected (fill_i); no filling in other rows, even if more vertical rows exist (e.g., some frames have 3 vertical rows, but fill only targets the second).
 * Filling pattern is color-dependent: m = c // 2 (special case m=2 for c=1); place m evenly spaced bars (every 2 cells) from the right edge inward, only if position is strictly between left and right (no overwriting sides); this aims to complete internal horizontal segments specific to the "digit" implied by color, but patterns vary (e.g., full middle bar for some like 6/0/8, partial for 2/3/4/5, minimal/none for 1/7).
 * Subtlety: Vertical validation (is_v and inner_bg) is strict—any non-background in inner cells during vertical rows breaks detection; bottom bar must have clean borders like top.
 * Frames do not overlap and are horizontally aligned starting at varying columns (e.g., col 1 or 2), with rest of grid as background; multiple frames stack vertically with background rows separating them.
 * Easy to miss: For some colors (e.g., 1,2), the expected pattern has fewer or differently positioned internal bars than the even-from-right rule; overfilling adds unwanted bars (e.g., in color 2's second vertical row), underfilling misses needed ones (e.g., in color 1); existing bars in input may already partially fill, but code overwrites to c if matching pattern.
 * No rotation, diagonal connections, or non-rectangular shapes; all frames are axis-aligned boxes ~5 rows high (top + 2-3 verticals + bottom).
 * After processing, output the modified grid; no further cleanup or symmetry enforcement.
 * Considerations across attempts: Color-specific patterns are not uniform (e.g., 4 needs bars at positions like 8,10,12 but code fills 7,9 for start=1); detection may fail if vertical rows have pre-existing internal non-bg (breaking inner_bg); small components threshold of 12 works for noise but might erase valid partial bars if <12; scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) matters for overlapping detections (though none observed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This reliably identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 8 in ex2/test, 3 in ex3; essential first step.)

```python
def erase_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] == bg:
                continue
            component = []
            q = deque([(i, j)])
            visited[i][j] = True
            color = g[i][j]
            while q:
                x, y = q.popleft()
                component.append((x, y))
                for dx, dy in dirs:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                        visited[nx][ny] = True
                        q.append((nx, ny))
            if len(component) < 12:
                for x, y in component:
                    g[x][y] = bg
```
(This correctly removes noise smaller than 12 connected cells of same color; works well in all examples, preserving frame structures; uses BFS for components—helpful and not broken.)

```python

                inner_bg = all(g[j][k] == bg for k in range(left + 1, right))
                if is_v and inner_bg:
                    num_v += 1

```
(This detects frames accurately in most cases but has flawed filling logic: even-spaced from right works for some colors (e.g., 6 fills 3 bars at 6,8,10 correctly; 4 fills 2 at 7,9 but expected needs 8,10) but fails for others (e.g., 2 fills 1 extra bar; 1 intends 2 but often skips due to detection issues); partially helpful for detection, but modify filling for accuracy.)

No other functions provided; no types or extraction tools (e.g., no object extraction like bounding boxes for digits—would be helpful for verifying patterns but absent; consider adding in future to analyze per-frame shapes independently).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt shows good understanding of background detection and small component erasure (preserves frames in all training examples without accidental removal).
 * Frame detection works well: correctly identifies top/bottom bars of span=11 with borders, validates 2+ vertical rows with clean inner bg, and confirms bottom—passes ex1 fully, detects all frames in ex2/ex3/test.
 * Filling partially works: for c=6 in ex2, correctly adds 3 internal bars (positions 6,8,10 in second vertical row, matching expected full-ish middle); for c=4 in ex2/ex3/test, adds 2 bars (e.g., positions 7,9 for start=1, but expected has 8,10—close but offset wrong, still better than nothing).
 * What didn't work in ex2 (color 1 frame, rows 2-6): detected frame but failed to fill second vertical row (row 4) at position 10 (expected 1 at cols 2,10,12; generated only 2,12—missing middle bar near right; likely due to inner_bg failing from pre-existing partial fills or num_v detection glitch, as m=2 should fill 8 and 10 but did neither).
 * What didn't work in ex3 (all frames): overfills second vertical rows with extra bars not in expected—e.g., for c=2 (rows 1-5), fills col 9 in row 3 (generated has 2 at 1,9,11; expected only 1,11); for c=4 (rows 7-11), fills cols 7,9 in row 9 (generated 1,7,9,11; expected likely 1,8,10,11 or similar partial); for c=1 (rows 13-17? wait, rows 13-17 is c=1, but generated row 15 has only sides at 1,11, missing expected middle like col 10; underfill similar to ex2); for c=2 again? Wait ex3 has c=2 top, c=4 mid, c=1 bottom—consistent over/underfill mismatch.
 * erase_small_components is helpful and correct (no issues observed; doesn't erase valid frame parts >=12 cells).
 * detect_and_complete_frames is partially broken in filling rule (even-from-right spacing wrong for low c like 1/2/3; e.g., for c=2 m=1 fills too far left at right-2, but expected often no fill or right-only; for c=1 special m=2 but detection often skips fill entirely—unknown why, perhaps strict inner_bg on partial input); still essential for core detection.
 * No unhelpful functions, but the fixed span=11 and h-4 range assume uniform frame size/height—works here but brittle if varies; no handling for pre-filled internals breaking detection.
 * Train1 correct overall (likely simple frame with matching fill pattern).
 * Train2 mismatches internal bar positions for c=1 (missing fill at col10 in row4; generated lacks it despite rule intending 2 fills).
 * Train3 has systematic overfill in second vertical rows for c=2/4 (extra bars at col9/7 etc.), underfill for c=1 (no middle bars added).
 * No object extraction function present—would help analyze per-color patterns (e.g., count needed bars per digit); consider adding to avoid hardcoding fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same flaws from training examples 2/3: inconsistent filling patterns that overfill some frames and underfill others, leading to incomplete or distorted shapes.
 * For top frame (c=2, rows 1-5, start=1, left=1/right=11): fills 1 bar at col9 in second vertical row (row3), generating 2 at cols 1,9,11 (plus right 11); but based on ex3's c=2 expected (only sides at 1,11 in second vertical), this adds an unneeded bar at 9—overfill, likely wrong (expected probably no middle fill for "2" shape).
 * For second frame (c=4, rows 7-11): fills 2 bars at cols 7,9 in row9 (second vertical), generating 4 at 1,7,9,11; but ex2/ex3 for c=4 expected partial middle like 1,8,10,11—offset wrong (7/9 vs 8/10), adds extras or misplaces, distorting shape.
 * For third frame (c=3, rows 13-17): fills 1 bar at col9 in row15, generating 3 at 1,9,11; likely overfill, as low c=3 probably needs minimal middle (e.g., right-only like "3" shape with short horizontal)—extra at9 mismatches training patterns for similar low colors.
 * For bottom frame (c=1, rows 19-23): no fill in row21 (second vertical), generating only sides at 1,11; but ex2 for c=1 expected additional near-right bar (e.g., at 10)—underfill, same issue as training2 (skipped despite m=2 rule; unknown if detection failed inner_bg or num_v<2 due to input partials).
 * Overall, test makes sense as output of this program (detects all 4 frames, applies flawed rule), but not correct for puzzle—shapes look "completed" but wrongly (e.g., too many internal bars for 2/3/4, too few for 1), probably failing to form intended digits; to fix, need color-specific fill positions (e.g., for c=1 fill only right-2; for c=2 no fill; adjust spacing/starting point).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells) of non-background colors are erased to the background, and then specific "frame" structures made of erased colors are completed by filling symmetric patterns inside their vertical border rows, likely representing windows or panels with color-coded internal designs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent color in the grid.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same color; only non-bg components smaller than 12 cells are erased, and their colors are tracked in a set (small_colors) for later use in completing frames.
 * Frames are detected starting from potential top horizontal bars: exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (where c is in small_colors) in a row, fully bordered on left/right by bg or grid edge; no partial or longer bars are considered.
 * Immediately below the top bar, there must be at least 2 consecutive "v-rows" (vertical border rows): each with c only at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the bar span, and all inner positions (between left+1 and right-1) must be bg; the loop continues counting consecutive v-rows beyond 2 but breaks on non-v-row, and filling only triggers if >=2 v-rows found.
 * Immediately after the final v-row, there must be a matching bottom horizontal bar (11 cells of c, bordered left/right by bg or edge).
 * Filling occurs only in the row index of the exact 2nd v-row (fill_i set when num_v reaches 2), placing c cells at inner positions calculated as right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m (symmetric every-other-column pattern from near the right edge, skipping the sides and bg inners); m = c // 2 by default, but special override for c==1 sets m = num_v - 2 (where num_v is the total consecutive v-rows found, which can exceed 2).
 * Only frames of colors in small_colors are completed (skips others, e.g., no filling in color 2 frames if 2 had no small components erased).
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 20x23 in training3, taller in test); scanning for top bars starts from row 0 to h-4 (to allow space for top + 2 v + bottom), and horizontally from col 0 to w-11.
 * Subtle: In examples, frames for different colors have 3 consecutive v-rows (e.g., top bar, v1, v2 (fill row), v3, bottom bar), but filling is always in v2 regardless of total num_v; the every-other fill pattern starts from right-2 (e.g., for span left=1/right=11, fills col9 then col7 for m=2, leaving col10/8/6/etc as bg).
 * Subtle: For c=1, the special m = num_v - 2 with num_v=3 yields m=1 (fills only col9), but this mismatches expectation (needs m=2 to fill col9 and col7); possibly c=1 should always use m=2, or m = (c + something)//2, or fill based on num_v independently of c.
 * Subtle: No overlapping frame detection or handling; each potential top bar is checked independently, which could lead to multiple completions in complex grids.
 * Subtle: After erasing small components, the grid is modified in-place, so v-row inners must remain bg (not affected by prior erasures); bars must be fully solid post-erasure.
 * Easy to miss: Borders can be grid edges (no need for bg beyond), but inners in v-rows must be strictly bg; span is hardcoded to 11, suggesting fixed frame width in the puzzle.
 * Easy to miss: num_v counts all consecutive v-rows (can be >2), but fill_i locks to the 2nd; for c!=1, m ignores num_v.
 * Considerations across attempts: No blob extraction beyond BFS in erase_small; no handling for non-frame small colors or vertical/horizontal variations; assumes all frames are horizontal-bar based with fixed span; test grid is taller (28 rows?), potentially with multiple frames stacked vertically, risking over-completion if partial structures exist.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it correctly erases small components (<12 cells) and uses small_colors to selectively complete frames, passing training examples 1 and 2 fully.
 * Successfully detects frames with 3 v-rows and fills correctly for c=4 (m=2, places c at col7 and col9 in 2nd v-row, matching expected symmetric every-other pattern from right).
 * Correctly skips filling for c=2 frame (no inner placements, as expected), likely because 2 not in small_colors (no small 2-components erased).
 * Fails training3 for c=1 frame: generates 1's only at col1,9,11 in row15 (2nd v-row, m=1 fills only col9 + sides), but expected 1's at col1,7,9,11 (needs m=2 to also fill col7); difference is missing inner 1 at col7, due to special c=1 rule yielding m=1 (with num_v=3) instead of m=2.
 * No issues with bar detection or bordering in training3 (top/bottom bars and v-rows match expected structure post-fill).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt (no prior attempts shown, but if from earlier, a general blob extractor would be similar to erase_small's BFS and helpful for debugging components, but not essential here as frames are structure-based, not arbitrary blobs).
 * The complete_frames function is mostly correct but broken for c=1 filling amount (under-fills by one position); the every-other pattern logic works but hardcoded span=11 limits flexibility.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; erase_small is precise and relevant, complete_frames is core but needs c=1 fix (e.g., hardcode m=2 for c=1 or adjust formula to m = max(c//2, 2) or m = (num_v -1)//1 for c=1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (applies same logic as training: fills c=4 frame with two inners at col7/9 in 2nd v-row row9; fills c=3 frame with one inner at col9 in 2nd v-row row15, m=3//2=1; fills two separate c=1 frames, each with one inner at col9 in their 2nd v-rows rows21 and ?—wait, bottom frame rows19 top,20 v1,21 v2 (fill),22 v3,23 bottom).
 * It does not look fully correct: Similar to training3 error, c=1 fillings under-fill (only col9 + sides per frame, but likely needs col7/9 + sides like expected in training3, suggesting same m=1 bug); for c=3 (odd like1), only one fill (col9) may be wrong if rule intends m=2 or more for odds (unknown without expected, but pattern mismatch risk). Most critically, it over-completes an unexpected second full 1 frame at rows19-23 (with fill in row21), plus extra all-bg rows at end—this likely shouldn't happen if test input had only partial/unintended structure there (e.g., no top/bottom bars or not in small_colors), indicating code falsely detects/completes non-frame artifacts; top c=2 frame correctly has no fill (skipped, as in training). Overall, demonstrates core frame detection but fails on fill count for specials (1 and possibly3) and risks false positives in taller grids with stacked elements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small connected components (fewer than 12 cells of the same non-background color) are erased to the background color (most common color, typically 8), and then incomplete "frame" or "window" structures are detected and completed by filling specific internal patterns in the second vertical support row of the frame, based on the color value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flat grid (e.g., 8); all other colors are potential objects.
 * Erase only connected components (4-directional adjacency) of size <12; larger ones stay intact. Erased cells are set to bg and tracked per color for potential later use (e.g., counting erased positions in specific rows).
 * Frames are rectangular structures spanning exactly 11 columns (span=11): a full top bar row of the color (all 11 cells same, bordered left/right by bg or edge), preceded by a full bg row above; followed by exactly two "vertical" rows (sides at left/right columns are color, internals bg); then a full bottom bar row (same as top, bordered); followed by a full bg row below.
 * Filling happens only in the second vertical row: sides (left/right) are already color (or partially), internals start as bg (possibly with some erased remnants).
 * Filling pattern: Place color in internal positions starting from the right, every 2 columns inward, for a number of positions m determined by color c: for c>1, m = c // 2; for c=1, special logic attempts m=2 minus count of already-erased (but non-bg?) positions in that row's internals, but this is buggy and leads to under-filling.
 * Subtlety: Detection must ensure exact structure (no extra rows, precise bordering, consecutive verticals exactly 2); frames don't overlap or nest in examples.
 * After erasing, some vertical rows may have partial internals already (erased small bits), but filling overrides to bg implicitly? No, code fills on bg or erased.
 * Min_size=12 is fixed; span=11 fixed for bars.
 * Grids are 23x23 in examples (h=23,w=23?), with frames aligned starting from various columns but often offset by 2 (e.g., cols 2-12).
 * For c=1, expected filling seems to place 1 internal (e.g., near right), but code's special case fails to match, possibly due to incorrect erased_count (counts erased positions but may include non-relevant or overcount).
 * Higher c fill more internals (e.g., c=6 fills 3 internals at positions right-2, right-4, right-6).
 * No filling in first vertical row; only second.
 * Erasure happens first, potentially removing small parts of frames, making completion necessary.
 * Potential miss: Frames must have above_bg and below_bg rows fully bg in the span; vertical rows must have exactly sides color and internals bg before filling.
 * Colors are low integers (1-6 in examples); no rotation or other symmetries.
 * Test input has multiple stacked frames (colors 4,3,1,2 from top? No, 2 top, then4,3,1 bottom), all with similar incomplete seconds V rows.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; no prior ones shown.
 * Worked: Training example 1 and 3 fully correct (likely simple frames with c>1 or no c=1 issues, proper erasure and filling matched expected).
 * Did not work: Training example 2 incorrect—under-filled internals in second V rows for all colors, but especially c=1 (generated row4 for c=1: only sides col2:1 and col12:1, no internal; expected: sides + col10:1, so missing one internal). For c=4 row16: generated only sides + ? (code should fill col8:4,col10:4 but output shows missing col8/col10? Wait, generated matches expected for c=4/6 visually in print but user marked INCORRECT—possible print error or subtle diff in c=1/6; specifically, for c=6 row10 generated misses col6:6 and col8:6 (only sides + col10?:6? but print shows only sides col2:6 col12:6); expected has col2:6, col6:6, col8:6, col10:6, col12:6. For c=4 similar underfill. Reason unknown but likely m=c//2 undercounts or filling loop skips (e.g., pos not internal). For c=1, special erased_count=1 (perhaps counting a pre-erased cell wrong), m=1, but fills wrong pos (right-2=col10, but generated didn't place it).
 * erase_small is correct and essential (properly identifies/erases small components without touching large frames).
 * complete_frames frame detection works (finds positions correctly for trains 1/3), but filling buggy: special c=1 logic broken (erased_count miscounts, e.g., includes side or non-internal); for c>1, may skip if pos==side or out of bounds subtly; doesn't handle if first V row has remnants affecting detection.
 * No unhelpful functions shown; all are relevant but filling needs fix (e.g., unify m= max(1, c//2) or pattern-based, not erased-dependent; for c=1 always fill 1 at right-2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, mirroring train2's under-filling issues (likely buggy filling logic applied consistently).
 * Generated shows erasure happened (no small blobs left), and partial frame completion: e.g., for top frame c=2 (rows1-5, cols1-11), second V row2? Wait row3 (0-index? row3:[8,2,8x7,2,8,2,8x...] has sides col1:2 col11:2 + internal col9:2 (right-2=9), but for m=2//2=1 correct per code, but expected likely needs 1 or 2 internals (e.g., col7:2 and/or col9:2 for "2" pattern?); similar for c=4 rows7-11 cols1-11, second V row9? Wait row10:[8,4,8x5,4,8,4,8,4,8x] wait col1:4, col7:4? (after 5 8's col2-6, col7:4, col8:8 col9:4 col10:8 col11:4—yes col7,9 filled for m=2, matches expected pattern like train2 c=4). For c=3 rows13-17 cols1-11, second V row15:[8,3,8x7,3,8,3,8x] col1:3, col9:3, col11:3 (m=1 at col9, likely underfill if expected col7,9). For c=1 rows19-23 cols1-11, second V row21:[8,1,8x7,1,8,1,8x] similar col1:1 col9:1 col11:1 (special m=1? at col9, but train2 suggests expected only/more at col10 or col8+10, so mismatched position/underfill). Overall, fills every-2-from-right but wrong count/pos for low c (1,2,3); looks like train2 failure extended (underfills internals, e.g., c=1/2/3 get only 1 internal vs. expected 1-2; c=4 gets correct 2). Does not match expected (unknown but inferred from train2: more internals for low c, precise positions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where small connected components of non-background colors are erased, and incomplete rectangular frame-like structures (made of small colors) are detected and partially completed with internal patterns based on the color value, likely to form symmetric or patterned fillings within the frames.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid (here, 8), and all processing preserves it while targeting non-background colors.
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), and only those with size <12 cells are erased to background; their colors are marked as "small" to allow frame detection on them later—note that erasing happens in-place on a copy, but only small ones, so large structures persist.
 * Frames are detected starting from horizontal "bars" of exactly 11 consecutive cells of a small color, bordered by background or edges on left/right; then check for exactly 2 rows of vertical sides (same color at left/right ends, with inner cells all background), followed by a bottom bar matching the top (11 cells, bordered).
 * Filling occurs only in the second vertical row (fill_i = position of second vertical), with a pattern dependent on color c: m = c//2, but special case for c=1 where m=2 if start col is odd, else 1; places c at positions right - 2*kk for kk=1 to m, if within left+1 to right-1 (creating every-other or spaced dots from the right).
 * Subtleties: Detection starts from row i in range(h-4), scans horizontally for starts; vertical check stops at first non-matching row; requires j < h after verticals for bottom check; no filling if num_v <2 or no bottom; frames must be isolated (bordered); small colors are only erased if their full component <12, but frames use remaining small color segments.
 * Key missable elements: The span is hardcoded to 11 (suggesting frames are 12 cells wide including borders? but inner fill is 9 cells wide effectively); filling is asymmetric (starts from right, every 2 steps); for c=1, parity of start col affects density (odd start -> denser); no diagonal connectivity; no overlapping frame detection or post-fill cleanup; assumes frames are axis-aligned and exactly 4 rows high (top + 2 verts + bottom); erased small components might leave fragments that don't trigger frames.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle multiple frames vertically stacked or separated by background rows; filling only happens if exactly 2 vertical rows are clean (inner bg); program works on copy to avoid mutating input; colors like 1-4 seem to represent different fill densities (1 sparse/dense variant, 2 single dot, 3 maybe 1 dot? but code uses //2 so 3//2=1, 4//2=2).

(This detects and fills frames; hardcoded span=11 and exact 2 vertical rows are crucial; filling logic is color-specific and right-aligned spaced; modifies g in-place.)

(The main program ties them together: copies grid, erases smalls, then completes frames, returns copy. No other functions like object extraction are present or needed, as component finding is embedded.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating good grasp of background detection, small component erasure (size<12), and basic frame completion for those cases.
 * What worked: Erasure correctly removes tiny blobs without touching large structures; frame detection triggers on bordered 11-span bars with exactly 2 clean verticals and a bottom, filling the second vertical row appropriately (e.g., for c=2, m=1, adds one internal dot from right).
 * What didn't work: No prior misses to note, but potential gaps include no handling for frames wider/narrower than 11-span (hardcoded), no filling if >2 verticals or irregular inners, asymmetric right-only filling might miss left-symmetric patterns, and special c=1 parity rule might fail if start col parity is misaligned in some grids.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions; all provided are relevant and functional, though frame detection could miss non-11 spans or overlapping frames.
 * Training examples likely had simple small erasures and standard frames, which this nailed; no noted mismatches in shapes or omissions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves four large vertical blocks (rows ~1-5 for color 2, ~7-11 for 4, ~13-17 for 3, ~19-23 for 1), each ~12 cells wide (cols 1-12), separated by background rows of 8's, on a 25x23 grid with bg=8 dominant.
 * Each block shows: full top/bottom rows of the color (12 cells, e.g., [8, c,c,...,c, 8,...] with 11 c's? but printed as 12 including edges? wait, lines show 12 c's from col1-12), partial side verticals (e.g., for 2: row2 has 2 at col1 and col12, inners 8; row3 has 2 at col1, some 8's, 2 at col11? wait, printed as [8,2,8,8,...,8,2,8,...] suggesting incomplete sides), and minimal internal fills in the second vertical row (e.g., for 1 in row22: [8,1,8's, then 1 at ~col8?,1 at col10?,1 at col12? but pattern is spaced from right).
 * Observed effects: No erasures happened (structures >12 cells, so intact); frame completion added sparse internal dots in the second row of each (e.g., color 4 row9 has extra 4's at col7,9,11? suggesting m=2, positions right-2,right-4; color 1 row22 has three 1's spaced, suggesting m=2 from odd start parity); but sides remain incomplete/gappy (e.g., row3 for 2 has isolated 2 at col11, not full vertical), and no dense fills or symmetry completion.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have cleaner/completed frames with symmetric or full internal patterns (e.g., for c=4, perhaps 2 dots per side or denser; for c=1, full every-other across inner 9 cells if dense variant), but generated has only right-aligned sparse fills and leaves side gaps unfilled—likely because detection requires perfect clean verticals (inner all bg), but test input probably has noisy/gappy sides, so no filling triggers, or partial detection only fills one row. This doesn't fully "complete" frames (e.g., color 3 row16 has no visible fills, just [8,3,8's,3,8's] suggesting m=1 but maybe missed); overall, output looks partially processed but incomplete/asymmetric, not matching a "solved" puzzle where frames would be symmetrically filled or sides repaired—unknown if input had small components to erase, but none appear erased.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where cells are colored with numbers (e.g., 8 as background), involving noise removal of small connected components and completion of incomplete rectangular frames (boxes) by filling missing horizontal patterns in their middle rows based on the frame's color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color across the entire flattened grid.
 * Connected components are 4-directional (orthogonal neighbors only, no diagonals) groups of the same non-background color.
 * Erase (set to background) any connected component smaller than 12 cells, and mark its color as "small" to allow it for frame detection but ignore larger blobs.
 * Frames are specifically 11 cells wide (fixed span), starting from non-background cells in upper rows; top and bottom bars must be full horizontal runs of color c, bordered on left/right by background or grid edge.
 * After a top bar, exactly two "vertical" rows must follow: each with c only at left and right edges, and all inner cells (between left+1 and right-1) as background; the second of these is the fill row.
 * Immediately after the two vertical rows, a matching bottom bar.
 * Filling in the second vertical row: compute m = c // 2, but special case for c=1 where m=2 if starting column index is odd (start % 2 == 1) else m=1; place c at inner positions calculated as right - 2 * kk for kk=1 to m (e.g., skips every other cell inward from right side).
 * Detection scans row-by-row from top, left-to-right, but only considers small colors for frames to avoid treating large structures as frames.
 * Subtleties: Vertical checks stop if not exactly two clean verticals before bottom; no filling if num_v < 2 or no bottom; assumes frames don't overlap or nest; fixed span=11 means only that width is handled; parity for c=1 depends on start column (0-based index); inner fill positions must be strictly between left and right to avoid overwriting sides.
 * Easy to miss: Borders must be checked (edge or bg adjacent); components must be same-color only; if a frame has extra cells, it might not detect cleanly; no diagonal connectivity; erasing small components happens before detection, so noise doesn't interfere.
 * All frames in test are aligned starting at column 1 (odd), affecting c=1 rule; no rotation or varying widths; output is the modified grid with erasures and fills applied in-place.

(Detects frames and fills middles; handles exact structure checks, borders, and color-specific patterns; span=11 fixed; modifies in-place; core to solving and correct.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = find_background(g)
    work_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    small_colors: Set[int] = set()
    erase_small_components(work_g, bg, 12, small_colors)
    detect_and_complete_frames(work_g, bg, small_colors)
    return work_g
```
(Orchestrates the full process; copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential wrapper.)

No custom types defined, but Set[int] for small_colors and List[List[int]] for grid are used effectively. No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant and working.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it succeeded on all three training examples (correct outputs).
 * Erase_small_components correctly identifies and removes noise <12 cells without affecting large frames.
 * detect_and_complete_frames properly detects the exact frame structure (top + 2 verticals + bottom) and applies color-specific fills without overfilling or missing borders.
 * For c=1 special case, parity check (start % 2) is handled correctly.
 * No misses observed: training passed fully; no unknown mismatches in shapes or omissions.
 * All functions are helpful and not broken; no irrelevant ones to avoid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense, as it shows four completed frames (colors 1,2,3,4) with noise erased (no small components visible) and middles filled per rules.
 * Specific effects: Background 8 dominates; frames start at column 1 (left=1, right=11, span=11).
   - Color 2 (rows ~1-5): m=1, filled one c at col9 in second vertical row (row ~3); sides and bars intact, inner bg elsewhere.
   - Color 4 (rows ~7-11): m=2, filled two c's at col7 and col9 in second vertical row (row ~9); matches every-other spacing from right.
   - Color 3 (rows ~13-17): m=1, filled one c at col9 in second vertical row (row ~15).
   - Color 1 (rows ~19-23): c=1 special, start=1 odd so m=2, filled two c's at col7 and col9 in second vertical row (row ~21).
 * No differences from expected: Fills are precisely at calculated positions (right - 2*kk), only inner, no side overwrites; vertical rows have clean bg inners pre-fill; bottom bars match tops; extra 8's in unused areas (rows 0,6,12,18,24-25) are bg.
 * If input had unfilled middles and no small noise, this exactly completes them; no unexpected changes (e.g., no erased frames, no extra fills).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** provided train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to elements/properties that demonstrably affect or transform each other in every case, based on shared attributes like color, count, position, holes, or pixels. I have excluded:
- Any high-level puzzle solution or hypothesis.
- Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific pixel values of small shapes beyond total aggregation; background bbox variations; non-interacting small shapes like greens in example 1 without frames).
- Inconsistent interactions (e.g., no reliable position-based movement of small shapes to specific frames beyond color matching; no consistent effect from small shape sizes/pixels on addition count; no cross-frame interactions).
- Forced or unclear connections (e.g., unknown reasons for background holes always becoming exactly 3; no identifiable semantic meaning like symbols affecting transformations, as data shows only blob properties).

Interactions are described as pairs or chains of affecting elements (e.g., A -> B means A affects/transforms B). Only properties with direct, observable effects are included.

#### 1. **Small Standalone Squares (Outside Frames) -> Frame Interiors (via Matching Frame Border Color)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small standalone squares (h=0, scattered positions outside frames, various colors/sizes, p=1-8 typically); frame borders (h=1, p=28, fixed stacked positions like [1,1,11,5]/[1,7,11,11]/[1,13,11,17]); interiors (h=0 initially, p=27, inset positions like [2,2,10,4]/[2,8,10,10]/[2,14,10,16], color matching background).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Number of small standalone components (count of separate blobs, regardless of their individual p or bbox) of a specific color -> number of new 1-pixel squares (h=0, p=1, 1x1 bbox) created inside the interior of the frame border matching that color.
       - Example: In all cases, if a frame border is yellow and there are N yellow small components outside, exactly N yellow 1-pixel squares appear inside its interior.
       - Consistent across all: Addition only occurs for colors matching a frame border; 0 matching small components -> 0 added (e.g., red frame in train 3 has 0 red small -> no addition).
     - Position effect: Added 1-pixel squares consistently appear inside the matching interior's bbox (inset from border), arranged horizontally in a centered row (e.g., x-positions like 7/9 or 6/8/10 within interior x=2-10/12, at vertical center y of interior).
     - No effect if no matching frame border color (e.g., green/red small in train 2 contribute nothing to interiors).
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Exact reason for addition count being component count (not total p or position); no consistent transformation of original small p into added squares (added always p=1 each).

#### 2. **Added 1-Pixel Squares Inside Interiors -> Interior Properties (Holes and Pixels)**
   - **Components Involved**: New 1-pixel squares (h=0, p=1, color matching frame border, positioned inside interior); interiors (h=0 initially, p=27, same color as background).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Each added 1-pixel square -> +1 hole to the interior (h increases by the number of added squares); -1 pixel to the interior (p decreases by the number of added squares).
       - Total conservation: Interior p + (number added × 1) = original 27 in all cases (e.g., h=2, p=25 + 2×1 = 27).
     - Color effect: Added squares always match the frame border color (different from interior color), creating color-based contrast inside.
     - Consistent across all: Unchanged interiors (0 added) retain h=0, p=27; no overflow or boundary effects on interior bbox.
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Why holes increase exactly by addition count (no other hole sources); no effect on interior color or bbox.

#### 3. **All Small Standalone Squares (Outside Frames) -> Background (Pixels)**
   - **Components Involved**: All small standalone squares (h=0, scattered, all colors, all p values); background (h=high like 8-14, p=265-360, full bbox like [0,0,22,22], color matching interiors).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Total pixels (sum of p across all small standalone components, regardless of color, size, or position) -> + that total to background p (background p increases exactly by this sum).
       - Example: Train 1 small total p=28 -> background p=336 +28=364; train 2 total p=27 ->337+27=364; train 3 total p=30 ->265+30=295.
     - All small standalone components disappear entirely (not listed in outputs).
     - Color consistency: No color change to background; remains matching interior color.
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Why total p (not count or color) affects background; no consistent effect on background bbox (minor variations like y=19 vs. 22).

#### 4. **Background -> Background (Holes, Independent of Other Elements)**
   - **Components Involved**: Background (h=high initially, full bbox, color matching interiors).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - Background holes -> set to exactly 3 (regardless of initial h=8/11/12/14 or any other changes).
     - No direct tie to other elements' holes/pixels (e.g., not summing frame holes or small counts).
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Reason for fixed h=3 (possibly tied to number of frames=3, but unconfirmed as test has 4 frames); no effect on background color or p beyond the small pixels addition.

#### 5. **Interiors <-> Background (Color Consistency)**
   - **Components Involved**: All interiors (h=0 initially, p=27, inset bboxes); background (h=high, full bbox).
   - **Consistent Interaction**:
     - All interiors share the same color -> background adopts/ retains exactly that color (no change in inputs or outputs).
       - Consistent across all: Blue interiors/bg in train 1; maroon in train 2; green in train 3.
     - No pixel or hole sharing between them (interiors transform independently per frame).
   - **Unknown/Excluded**: Why interiors all match background color initially; no position or transformation effects between them.

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No Other Consistent Interactions Identified**: 
  - Frame borders do not directly affect interiors (beyond enabling color-matched additions); no hole/pixel changes to borders (always h=1, p=28).
  - No consistent movement/transformation based on small positions (e.g., top vs. bottom small do not preferentially go to top/bottom frames; only color matters).
  - Symbols/L-shapes (+, ×, etc.) mentioned in prompt not observable in data (all small are simple h=0 blobs; no consistent shape properties like edges/silhouettes affecting count or placement).
  - Test input follows same structure (4 frames, matching interior/bg color=maroon, small colors including frame matches like 4 yellow/2 red/1 green/1 blue), but no output provided, so not used for patterns.
- **Data Limitations**: Connections based solely on provided properties (color, h, bbox, p); no forced assumptions on unobservable visuals (e.g., no "movement" implied beyond disappearance/addition). If a transformation lacks explanation (e.g., background h=3), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 19:51:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where the background color dominates, small connected components (less than 12 cells) of non-background colors are erased, and larger structures resembling incomplete rectangular frames (with top/bottom horizontals and side verticals enclosing background interior) are detected and partially completed by filling specific single-cell positions inside the frame based on the frame's color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is identified as the most frequent color in the flattened grid (e.g., 8).
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right), and only those smaller than 12 cells are erased by overwriting with background and marking their color as "small" to avoid processing them as frames.
 * Frames are detected starting from horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-small color spanning at least 11 cells in a row.
 * Vertical sides must appear in exactly two positions per row (left and right aligned within the span, with tolerance for right side shifting left by at most 1 per row), enclosing an interior of pure background; at least 2 such vertical rows are required before a closing bottom horizontal (full span of the color).
 * Filling occurs only if a valid bottom is found after at least 2 verticals, and only in the specific row corresponding to the second vertical (fill_i); no filling in side rows or bottom.
 * Filling positions are calculated from the right edge (fill_right), placing single cells at pos = fill_right - 2 * kk for kk=1 to m, where m = color // 2 generally, but for color=1, m=2 if left column is odd (left % 2 == 1) else m=1; only fill if pos strictly inside left < pos < fill_right.
 * Subtle: Right side can taper inward (update current_right if this_right < current_right), but misalignment >1 breaks detection; inner must be all background, no partial fills assumed in input.
 * Subtle: Detection scans from top-left, row by row, and modifies grid in-place during filling; assumes frames don't overlap or interfere.
 * Subtle: Erasing happens first on a copy, but small_colors prevents re-processing erased colors as frames; large frames (like these) survive erasure.
 * Considerations: All frames in test start at col=1 (odd), span to col=11; verticals are sparse (only sides), interiors background; no diagonal/8-connectivity; no handling for non-rectangular or nested frames.
 * Easy to miss: Filling is single isolated cells, not full bars/lines—e.g., adds cells at col=9 for m=1, cols=7 and 9 for m=2, creating stubs near the right side rather than symmetric or full horizontals.
 * Easy to miss: Special rule for color=1 depends on left parity, possibly for asymmetric or parity-based patterns in training.
 * General: Grid dimensions variable (here ~26x23), multiple frames separated by background rows; no rotation/reflection; colors 1-4 seem to represent different completion patterns (e.g., fewer fills for lower m).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List, Set

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Identifies background reliably as mode; useful for any grid-based puzzle with dominant empty color.)

```python
def erase_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int, small_colors: Set[int]) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for si in range(h):
        for sj in range(w):
            if visited[si][sj] or g[si][sj] == bg:
                continue
            q = deque([(si, sj)])
            visited[si][sj] = True
            component = [(si, sj)]
            color = g[si][sj]
            while q:
                ci, cj = q.popleft()
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni = ci + di
                    nj = cj + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == color:
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        q.append((ni, nj))
                        component.append((ni, nj))
            if len(component) < min_size:
                small_colors.add(color)
                for x, y in component:
                    g[x][y] = bg
```
(BFS for connected components; essential for noise removal; tracks small colors to skip in frame detection; min_size=12 is puzzle-specific.)

```python
def detect_and_complete_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, small_colors: Set[int]) -> None:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])

            if g[i][start] == bg:
                continue
            c = g[i][start]
            if c not in small_colors:
                continue
            # find end of run
            end = start
            while end + 1 < w and g[i][end + 1] == c:
                end += 1
            span = end - start + 1
            if span < 11:
                continue
            left = start
            right = end

            fill_i = -1
            fill_right = -1
            j = i + 1
            current_right = right
            while j < h:
                possible_sides = [k for k in range(left, current_right + 1) if g[j][k] == c]
                if len(possible_sides) != 2:
                    break
                this_left = min(possible_sides)
                this_right = max(possible_sides)
                if this_left != left or abs(this_right - current_right) > 1:
                    break
                inner_bg = all(g[j][k] == bg for k in range(this_left + 1, this_right))
                if not inner_bg:
                    break
                num_v += 1
                if num_v == 2:
                    fill_i = j
                    fill_right = this_right
                if this_right < current_right:
                    current_right = this_right
                j += 1
            if num_v < 2:
                continue
            if j >= h:
                continue
            # check bottom
            bottom_span_start = left
            bottom_span_end = current_right
            is_bottom = all(g[j][k] == c for k in range(bottom_span_start, bottom_span_end + 1))
            if is_bottom and fill_i != -1:
                m = c // 2
                if c == 1:
                    m = 2 if (left % 2 == 1) else 1
                for kk in range(1, m + 1):
                    pos = fill_right - 2 * kk
                    if left < pos < fill_right:
                        g[fill_i][pos] = c
```
(Core frame detection and filling; scans for top runs, verifies verticals with strict side count and alignment, checks bottom, fills single cells in exact row/positions; handles tapering right side.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = find_background(g)
    work_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    small_colors: Set[int] = set()
    erase_small_components(work_g, bg, 12, small_colors)
    detect_and_complete_frames(work_g, bg, small_colors)
    return work_g
```
(Full pipeline; copies grid to avoid mutating input; integrates erasure and completion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it successfully passed all three training examples by correctly erasing small noise and completing frame internals with color-specific single-cell fills.
 * No misses in training, but subtle: the code skips frame colors if they are in small_colors (i.e., only processes large/surviving colors), which worked here as frames are large (>12 cells).
 * Extraction of components via BFS in erase_small_components is essential for identifying noise vs. frames.
 * Filling logic (m = c//2, special for c=1 based on left parity, positions from right every 2 cols) is key and matched training, but single-cell fills (not lines) is a subtlety that could be missed if expecting full bars.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant and functional, though detect_and_complete_frames assumes frames are top-to-bottom without overlaps and may miss non-11+ span or misaligned frames.
 * Train examples all correct, implying the single-cell filling and min_size=12 rules align with expected completions there (e.g., perhaps training had similar right-biased stubs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: it preserved the four large frames (colors 2,4,3,1 in rows ~1-5,7-11,13-17,19-23) with top/bottom horizontals (cols 1-11) and side verticals (cols 1 and 11, sparse), while adding single-cell fills in the second vertical row of each (row 3 for 2: cell at col9; row 9 for 4: cells at cols7,9; row 15 for 3: col9; row 21 for 1: cols7,9), plus background rows intact and no small components erased (frames >12 cells).
 * Fills match logic: m=1 for c=2,3 (one cell at right-2=9); m=2 for c=4 (4//2=2, cells at 11-2=9 and 11-4=7); m=2 for c=1 (left=1 odd). No extras or misses observed—e.g., row3 has 2s at cols1,9,11 (sides + fill), interiors remain background except fills; similar for others.
 * No differences from expected: if input had empty interiors/sides, output added exactly the right-biased single cells without overfilling or breaking structure; aligns with training success, suggesting these stubs complete the visual patterns (e.g., asymmetric letter-like shapes).
