=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 20:27:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 20:41:11] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 20:48:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the grid. Helpful for distinguishing digits from empty space."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    """Finds the rightmost column with a valid 11-pixel horizontal bar (potential digit top/bottom). Useful for determining content bounds to remove strays."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):  # Scan for 11-length bars
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 21:01:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

[2025-09-30 21:01:33] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns observed across all three train input-output pairs, below is a list of obvious, recurring interactions or effects between components/properties. Only elements with clear, consistent connections (present in *every* train example) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., exact pixel counts of input small components, background pixel increases, or semantic meanings like "plus signs" or "L-shapes" without proven ties) are excluded. Unknown mappings (e.g., how input small components determine exact N or positions) are noted as such rather than speculated.

- **Frame components (large, holes=1, ~28 pixels, fixed bbox like [1,1,11,5] or variants) ↔ Inner solid components (h=0, ~27 pixels, bbox nested inside frame)**:  
  Frame persists unchanged (color, holes, pixels, bbox). Inner gains holes=N and loses pixels exactly equal to N (resulting in ~27 - N pixels), where N is the number of 1px squares added inside it (N ≥ 0; if N=0, inner unchanged). This occurs in every frame-inner pair across all trains (e.g., train 1: three pairs with N=2,4,1; train 2: three pairs with N=1,3,2; train 3: three pairs with N=0,2,2). Inner color remains unchanged.

- **Frame color (C) ↔ Added 1px square color**:  
  Each added 1px square inside an inner is always the same color as its parent frame (C). Consistent in every addition across all trains (e.g., train 1: Yellow frame → Yellow squares; Maroon frame → Maroon squares; Red frame → Red square; train 2: Blue → Blue; Pink → Pink; Yellow → Yellow; train 3: Yellow → Yellow; Blue → Blue; no addition for Red).

- **Added 1px squares (small, holes=0, 1 pixel, positioned inside inner bbox) ↔ Inner solid component**:  
  Added squares are always positioned within the inner's bbox (e.g., at central x-coordinates like 7-9 or 6-10, varying y within inner). Their presence directly causes the inner's holes to increase to exactly N (number of squares) and pixels to decrease by exactly N. Appears in every train output where N > 0 (total N varies per frame: 2+4+1 in train 1; 1+3+2 in train 2; 0+2+2 in train 3). No added squares appear outside inners or in inputs.

- **Input small components (scattered to right of frames, various colors/sizes like 2-8 pixels, holes=0, positions in gaps between frames) ↔ Added 1px squares**:  
  All such input small components (e.g., ~3-7 per train, total pixels 10-30) are absent in every output, while added 1px squares appear in equivalent total numbers (e.g., train 1: ~5 input smalls → 7 1px squares; train 2: ~6 input smalls → 6 1px squares; train 3: ~5 input smalls → 4 1px squares). Suggests input smalls are transformed into added 1px squares (color overridden to frame color), but exact mapping (how input determines N or positions per frame) is unknown and inconsistent without further rules.

- **Background component (large, high holes like 8-12, full bbox like [0,0,22,22], ~265-337 pixels) ↔ Overall transformation**:  
  Hole count always decreases to exactly 3 in every output (from 12→3, 11→3, 8→3). Pixel count always increases (by 27-30), but amount varies and has no clear tie to other properties (unknown cause).

No other consistent interactions found (e.g., no reliable position→color effects, hole count→color, or shape-specific transformations like edges/silhouettes across all examples; input small colors do not propagate to outputs). Elements like scattered small squares or polyominoes in inputs lack proven consistent ties beyond the general transformation noted above.

[2025-09-30 21:03:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

```

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):  # Scan for 11-length bars
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns observed across all three train input-output pairs, below is a list of obvious, recurring interactions or effects between components/properties. Only elements with clear, consistent connections (present in *every* train example) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., exact pixel counts of input small components, background pixel increases, or semantic meanings like "plus signs" or "L-shapes" without proven ties) are excluded. Unknown mappings (e.g., how input small components determine exact N or positions) are noted as such rather than speculated.

- **Frame components (large, holes=1, ~28 pixels, fixed bbox like [1,1,11,5] or variants) ↔ Inner solid components (h=0, ~27 pixels, bbox nested inside frame)**:  
  Frame persists unchanged (color, holes, pixels, bbox). Inner gains holes=N and loses pixels exactly equal to N (resulting in ~27 - N pixels), where N is the number of 1px squares added inside it (N ≥ 0; if N=0, inner unchanged). This occurs in every frame-inner pair across all trains (e.g., train 1: three pairs with N=2,4,1; train 2: three pairs with N=1,3,2; train 3: three pairs with N=0,2,2). Inner color remains unchanged.

- **Frame color (C) ↔ Added 1px square color**:  
  Each added 1px square inside an inner is always the same color as its parent frame (C). Consistent in every addition across all trains (e.g., train 1: Yellow frame → Yellow squares; Maroon frame → Maroon squares; Red frame → Red square; train 2: Blue → Blue; Pink → Pink; Yellow → Yellow; train 3: Yellow → Yellow; Blue → Blue; no addition for Red).

- **Added 1px squares (small, holes=0, 1 pixel, positioned inside inner bbox) ↔ Inner solid component**:  
  Added squares are always positioned within the inner's bbox (e.g., at central x-coordinates like 7-9 or 6-10, varying y within inner). Their presence directly causes the inner's holes to increase to exactly N (number of squares) and pixels to decrease by exactly N. Appears in every train output where N > 0 (total N varies per frame: 2+4+1 in train 1; 1+3+2 in train 2; 0+2+2 in train 3). No added squares appear outside inners or in inputs.

- **Input small components (scattered to right of frames, various colors/sizes like 2-8 pixels, holes=0, positions in gaps between frames) ↔ Added 1px squares**:  
  All such input small components (e.g., ~3-7 per train, total pixels 10-30) are absent in every output, while added 1px squares appear in equivalent total numbers (e.g., train 1: ~5 input smalls → 7 1px squares; train 2: ~6 input smalls → 6 1px squares; train 3: ~5 input smalls → 4 1px squares). Suggests input smalls are transformed into added 1px squares (color overridden to frame color), but exact mapping (how input determines N or positions per frame) is unknown and inconsistent without further rules.

- **Background component (large, high holes like 8-12, full bbox like [0,0,22,22], ~265-337 pixels) ↔ Overall transformation**:  
  Hole count always decreases to exactly 3 in every output (from 12→3, 11→3, 8→3). Pixel count always increases (by 27-30), but amount varies and has no clear tie to other properties (unknown cause).

No other consistent interactions found (e.g., no reliable position→color effects, hole count→color, or shape-specific transformations like edges/silhouettes across all examples; input small colors do not propagate to outputs). Elements like scattered small squares or polyominoes in inputs lack proven consistent ties beyond the general transformation noted above.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:18:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """
    Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the flattened grid.
    Helpful for initializing output and skipping bg in detection; works reliably as 8 is dominant.
    """
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, i: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Computes relative positions (0-10) for middle row (i+2) fillings based on digit c and row i.
    Current implementation has bugs for c=1/2 (modulo condition too restrictive, wrong positions added).
    Helpful as a modular way to handle digit-specific patterns, but needs fixing (e.g., always add [8] for c=1, [4,8] or similar for c=2 based on examples).
    """
    positions = [0, 10]  # Always edges
    mod = i % 10
    if c == 4:
        positions.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        positions.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 8:
        positions.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 3:
        positions.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c in (1, 2):
        if mod == 3:
            if c == 1:
                positions.extend([6, 8])
            else:
                positions.extend([8])
    return positions
```

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 21:18:48] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-09-30 21:20:31] Response:
- **Frame color → Color of inserted small squares**: In every train example, the color of each frame consistently determines the color of the 1-pixel squares inserted into its corresponding inside fill (e.g., yellow frame → yellow small squares; maroon frame → maroon small squares). This interaction is consistent and does not depend on other elements.

- **Inserted small squares (count) → Inside fill holes**: In every train example, the number of 1-pixel squares inserted into an inside fill consistently increases the holes property of that fill by exactly the count of inserted squares (e.g., 2 squares → +2 holes; 4 squares → +4 holes; 0 squares → +0 holes). This is a direct, consistent effect across all frames in all examples.

- **Inserted small squares (count) → Inside fill pixels**: In every train example, the number of 1-pixel squares inserted into an inside fill consistently decreases the pixels property of that fill by exactly the count of inserted squares (e.g., 2 squares → -2 pixels; 4 squares → -4 pixels; 0 squares → 0 change). This is a direct, consistent effect across all frames in all examples.

- **Inserted small squares (position) → Inside fill bbox**: In every train example, the y-coordinate (row) of all inserted 1-pixel squares is consistently the middle y-value of the inside fill's bbox (e.g., inside y=2-4 → inserts at y=3; y=9-11 → inserts at y=10; y=15-17 → inserts at y=16). The x-positions vary but remain within the inside fill's x-range. This positional interaction is consistent for all insertions.

- **Inside fill color ↔ Background color**: In every train example, the color of all inside fills is consistently identical to the background color (e.g., all blue in train 1; all maroon in train 2; all green in train 3). No transformation changes this color matching.

- **Outside small components (total pixels) → Background pixels**: In every train example, the sum of pixels from all outside small components (non-frame, non-inside, non-background) consistently equals the increase in the background's pixels property (e.g., +28 pixels from smalls → background +28; +27 → +27; +30 → +30). This is a direct pixel transfer effect.

- **Outside small components → Removal**: In every train example, all outside small components (e.g., small bars, lines, or blobs near edges) are consistently absent in the output, with no remnants or transformations into other visible elements except their pixel contribution to the background.

- **Background holes → Fixed value**: In every train example, the background's holes property is consistently set to exactly 3 in the output, regardless of input value (e.g., from 12 → 3; 11 → 3; 8 → 3). This is a uniform transformation not tied to other quantifiable properties.

- **Frame properties (holes, pixels, bbox, color) → Unchanged**: In every train example, each frame's holes (=1), pixels (=28), bbox, and color remain completely unchanged from input to output, with no interactions affecting them.

- **Unknown: Determination of inserted small squares (count and exact x-positions)**: Across all examples, the count and specific x-positions of inserted small squares vary per frame and do not follow an obvious, consistent rule based on provided properties (e.g., outside small counts, colors, positions, or pixels do not uniformly map to insertion details in every case). This interaction exists (outside elements appear to influence insertions per section) but cannot be explained consistently without forcing unrelated connections.

[2025-09-30 21:20:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the grid. Helpful for distinguishing digits from empty space."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    """Finds the rightmost column with a valid 11-pixel horizontal bar (potential digit top/bottom). Useful for determining content bounds to remove strays."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):  # Scan for 11-length bars
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """
    Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the flattened grid.
    Helpful for initializing output and skipping bg in detection; works reliably as 8 is dominant.
    """
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, i: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Computes relative positions (0-10) for middle row (i+2) fillings based on digit c and row i.
    Current implementation has bugs for c=1/2 (modulo condition too restrictive, wrong positions added).
    Helpful as a modular way to handle digit-specific patterns, but needs fixing (e.g., always add [8] for c=1, [4,8] or similar for c=2 based on examples).
    """
    positions = [0, 10]  # Always edges
    mod = i % 10
    if c == 4:
        positions.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        positions.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 8:
        positions.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 3:
        positions.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c in (1, 2):
        if mod == 3:
            if c == 1:
                positions.extend([6, 8])
            else:
                positions.extend([8])
    return positions
```

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

- **Frame color → Color of inserted small squares**: In every train example, the color of each frame consistently determines the color of the 1-pixel squares inserted into its corresponding inside fill (e.g., yellow frame → yellow small squares; maroon frame → maroon small squares). This interaction is consistent and does not depend on other elements.

- **Inserted small squares (count) → Inside fill holes**: In every train example, the number of 1-pixel squares inserted into an inside fill consistently increases the holes property of that fill by exactly the count of inserted squares (e.g., 2 squares → +2 holes; 4 squares → +4 holes; 0 squares → +0 holes). This is a direct, consistent effect across all frames in all examples.

- **Inserted small squares (count) → Inside fill pixels**: In every train example, the number of 1-pixel squares inserted into an inside fill consistently decreases the pixels property of that fill by exactly the count of inserted squares (e.g., 2 squares → -2 pixels; 4 squares → -4 pixels; 0 squares → 0 change). This is a direct, consistent effect across all frames in all examples.

- **Inserted small squares (position) → Inside fill bbox**: In every train example, the y-coordinate (row) of all inserted 1-pixel squares is consistently the middle y-value of the inside fill's bbox (e.g., inside y=2-4 → inserts at y=3; y=9-11 → inserts at y=10; y=15-17 → inserts at y=16). The x-positions vary but remain within the inside fill's x-range. This positional interaction is consistent for all insertions.

- **Inside fill color ↔ Background color**: In every train example, the color of all inside fills is consistently identical to the background color (e.g., all blue in train 1; all maroon in train 2; all green in train 3). No transformation changes this color matching.

- **Outside small components (total pixels) → Background pixels**: In every train example, the sum of pixels from all outside small components (non-frame, non-inside, non-background) consistently equals the increase in the background's pixels property (e.g., +28 pixels from smalls → background +28; +27 → +27; +30 → +30). This is a direct pixel transfer effect.

- **Outside small components → Removal**: In every train example, all outside small components (e.g., small bars, lines, or blobs near edges) are consistently absent in the output, with no remnants or transformations into other visible elements except their pixel contribution to the background.

- **Background holes → Fixed value**: In every train example, the background's holes property is consistently set to exactly 3 in the output, regardless of input value (e.g., from 12 → 3; 11 → 3; 8 → 3). This is a uniform transformation not tied to other quantifiable properties.

- **Frame properties (holes, pixels, bbox, color) → Unchanged**: In every train example, each frame's holes (=1), pixels (=28), bbox, and color remain completely unchanged from input to output, with no interactions affecting them.

- **Unknown: Determination of inserted small squares (count and exact x-positions)**: Across all examples, the count and specific x-positions of inserted small squares vary per frame and do not follow an obvious, consistent rule based on provided properties (e.g., outside small counts, colors, positions, or pixels do not uniformly map to insertion details in every case). This interaction exists (outside elements appear to influence insertions per section) but cannot be explained consistently without forcing unrelated connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:24:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the flattened grid."""

    if c in (1, 4):
        pos.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        pos.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 8:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    return pos

        for j in range(m - 10):

            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Trims columns beyond max_r +1 by setting them to background."""

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

[2025-09-30 21:24:27] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-09-30 21:25:47] Response:
### Interconnected Components and Properties
Below is a list of components and their consistent interactions or effects on each other, observed across **all** train examples (train inputs 1, 2, and 3). Only obvious, direct connections that appear in *every* example are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small shapes with no apparent effect, or inconsistent color/position mappings) are excluded. Interactions are limited to those with consistent patterns in properties like color, holes, pixels, and position. Where a transformation (e.g., how a specific value is derived) cannot be explained consistently from the data without forcing assumptions, it is noted as "unknown."

#### Core Components
These are the primary elements that interact consistently:
- **Frames**: Rectangular outlines, consistently positioned in vertical rows (e.g., bbox starting at x=[1,*], width ~10 units, height 4 units; specific y-positions like [1,1,11,5], [1,7,11,11], [1,13,11,17]). Properties: variable color (C_f, e.g., Yellow, Maroon, Red, Blue), holes=1, pixels=28. Always unchanged in outputs.
- **Inner fillers**: Filled shapes inside each frame (bbox inset within frame, e.g., [2,y+1,10,y+3], ~8x3 units). Properties: variable color (C_i, often consistent across inners in one example but different from C_f), initial holes=0, initial pixels=27. Position tied directly to frame (nested).
- **Small peripherals**: Small shapes adjacent to the right of frames (bbox x=[14-21,*], y overlapping frame's y-range; various small sizes). Properties: variable color (C_p), holes=0, variable pixels (P_p, typically 2-8 per shape, multiple per frame). Always disappear entirely in outputs (no trace).
- **Large background**: Overarching shape covering most/all canvas (bbox ~[0,0,22,22] or similar, full extent). Properties: variable color (C_b), initial holes (H_b >3, variable), initial pixels (P_b, variable). Always present and modified.

No other components (e.g., isolated dots or unrelated silhouettes) show consistent interactions across all examples.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are pairwise or grouped effects that occur in *every* train example. They involve direct changes in properties (e.g., color propagation, pixel transfer, hole modifications) tied to position (e.g., adjacency or nesting).

1. **Small peripherals → Large background (pixel transfer and hole reset)**:
   - All small peripherals (across the entire scene) disappear completely.
   - Their total pixels (sum of all P_p) are added to the large background's pixels: output P_b = input P_b + Σ(P_p).
     - Example: Train 1 total Σ(P_p)=28 → +28 pixels; Train 2 Σ(P_p)=27 → +27; Train 3 Σ(P_p)=30 → +30.
   - Large background holes reset to a fixed value tied to the number of frames (always 3 frames in trains → holes=3 in every output, regardless of input H_b).
   - Large background color (C_b) unchanged.
   - Position effect: Peripherals must be adjacent/right of frames to be included in the sum (no non-adjacent small shapes in examples).
   - Bbox of large background unchanged (minor y-extent variations in Train 3, but no consistent transformation).

2. **Small peripherals → Frames/Inners (dot addition via unknown transformation)**:
   - Small peripherals adjacent to a specific frame (overlapping y-range, right-side position) are transformed into small "dots" inside that frame.
   - Dots: 1-pixel squares (pixels=1, holes=0), color = frame's color (C_f propagation), position = inside the frame's inner filler (middle row y of inner, spaced x-positions like 7/9 or 3/5/7/9/6/8/10, consistent nesting but exact x varies slightly by frame bbox).
   - Number of dots per frame (n, 0-4 in examples) is unknown (varies; appears tied to adjacent peripherals' pixels/count/properties, but no consistent formula, e.g., not direct pixel sum or count—Train 1 second frame: 4px total → n=4; Train 3 top: 8px → n=0).
   - Effect on frame: Unchanged (C_f, holes=1, pixels=28, bbox fixed).
   - No color propagation from C_p to dots (always C_f).

3. **Added dots → Inner fillers (hole and pixel modification)**:
   - For each frame's inner: holes increase by exactly n (number of added dots): output holes = 0 + n.
   - Pixels decrease by exactly n: output pixels = 27 - n (direct subtraction, implying dots "punch out" 1px each from inner).
   - Inner color (C_i) unchanged.
   - Bbox unchanged (remains nested in frame).
   - Position effect: Dots placed within inner's bbox, causing the hole/pixel change (topological interaction: added holes in inner due to nesting).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no frame-to-frame effects, no consistent color changes beyond C_f to dots, no position-based transformations like rotation or movement across examples). Semantic shapes (e.g., plus/L via bbox) do not show consistent effects on n or other properties. Large background does not directly affect frames/inners.

[2025-09-30 21:25:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the grid. Helpful for distinguishing digits from empty space."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    """Finds the rightmost column with a valid 11-pixel horizontal bar (potential digit top/bottom). Useful for determining content bounds to remove strays."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):  # Scan for 11-length bars
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

    return positions
```

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the flattened grid."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    """Returns positions (relative to j) for middle row (i+2) segments based on digit c and row mod 10."""
    pos = [0, 10]  # Always include left and right ends
    if c in (1, 4):
        pos.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        pos.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 8:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    return pos
```

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    """Finds the rightmost column with a complete 11-cell horizontal non-background bar to determine content width."""
    n = len(g)

    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python

    """Trims columns beyond max_r +1 by setting them to background."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties
Below is a list of components and their consistent interactions or effects on each other, observed across **all** train examples (train inputs 1, 2, and 3). Only obvious, direct connections that appear in *every* example are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small shapes with no apparent effect, or inconsistent color/position mappings) are excluded. Interactions are limited to those with consistent patterns in properties like color, holes, pixels, and position. Where a transformation (e.g., how a specific value is derived) cannot be explained consistently from the data without forcing assumptions, it is noted as "unknown."

#### Core Components
These are the primary elements that interact consistently:
- **Frames**: Rectangular outlines, consistently positioned in vertical rows (e.g., bbox starting at x=[1,*], width ~10 units, height 4 units; specific y-positions like [1,1,11,5], [1,7,11,11], [1,13,11,17]). Properties: variable color (C_f, e.g., Yellow, Maroon, Red, Blue), holes=1, pixels=28. Always unchanged in outputs.
- **Inner fillers**: Filled shapes inside each frame (bbox inset within frame, e.g., [2,y+1,10,y+3], ~8x3 units). Properties: variable color (C_i, often consistent across inners in one example but different from C_f), initial holes=0, initial pixels=27. Position tied directly to frame (nested).
- **Small peripherals**: Small shapes adjacent to the right of frames (bbox x=[14-21,*], y overlapping frame's y-range; various small sizes). Properties: variable color (C_p), holes=0, variable pixels (P_p, typically 2-8 per shape, multiple per frame). Always disappear entirely in outputs (no trace).
- **Large background**: Overarching shape covering most/all canvas (bbox ~[0,0,22,22] or similar, full extent). Properties: variable color (C_b), initial holes (H_b >3, variable), initial pixels (P_b, variable). Always present and modified.

No other components (e.g., isolated dots or unrelated silhouettes) show consistent interactions across all examples.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are pairwise or grouped effects that occur in *every* train example. They involve direct changes in properties (e.g., color propagation, pixel transfer, hole modifications) tied to position (e.g., adjacency or nesting).

1. **Small peripherals → Large background (pixel transfer and hole reset)**:
   - All small peripherals (across the entire scene) disappear completely.
   - Their total pixels (sum of all P_p) are added to the large background's pixels: output P_b = input P_b + Σ(P_p).
     - Example: Train 1 total Σ(P_p)=28 → +28 pixels; Train 2 Σ(P_p)=27 → +27; Train 3 Σ(P_p)=30 → +30.
   - Large background holes reset to a fixed value tied to the number of frames (always 3 frames in trains → holes=3 in every output, regardless of input H_b).
   - Large background color (C_b) unchanged.
   - Position effect: Peripherals must be adjacent/right of frames to be included in the sum (no non-adjacent small shapes in examples).
   - Bbox of large background unchanged (minor y-extent variations in Train 3, but no consistent transformation).

2. **Small peripherals → Frames/Inners (dot addition via unknown transformation)**:
   - Small peripherals adjacent to a specific frame (overlapping y-range, right-side position) are transformed into small "dots" inside that frame.
   - Dots: 1-pixel squares (pixels=1, holes=0), color = frame's color (C_f propagation), position = inside the frame's inner filler (middle row y of inner, spaced x-positions like 7/9 or 3/5/7/9/6/8/10, consistent nesting but exact x varies slightly by frame bbox).
   - Number of dots per frame (n, 0-4 in examples) is unknown (varies; appears tied to adjacent peripherals' pixels/count/properties, but no consistent formula, e.g., not direct pixel sum or count—Train 1 second frame: 4px total → n=4; Train 3 top: 8px → n=0).
   - Effect on frame: Unchanged (C_f, holes=1, pixels=28, bbox fixed).
   - No color propagation from C_p to dots (always C_f).

3. **Added dots → Inner fillers (hole and pixel modification)**:
   - For each frame's inner: holes increase by exactly n (number of added dots): output holes = 0 + n.
   - Pixels decrease by exactly n: output pixels = 27 - n (direct subtraction, implying dots "punch out" 1px each from inner).
   - Inner color (C_i) unchanged.
   - Bbox unchanged (remains nested in frame).
   - Position effect: Dots placed within inner's bbox, causing the hole/pixel change (topological interaction: added holes in inner due to nesting).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no frame-to-frame effects, no consistent color changes beyond C_f to dots, no position-based transformations like rotation or movement across examples). Semantic shapes (e.g., plus/L via bbox) do not show consistent effects on n or other properties. Large background does not directly affect frames/inners.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

[2025-09-30 21:28:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or symbols, where the task is to process the input grid by identifying background (most common value), then detecting and rendering specific multi-row shapes (likely letters or glyphs) that start with horizontal bars of 11 identical non-background cells, extending vertically with side pillars and patterned middle rows based on the shape's "color" (number). The output is a cleaned or stylized version of the grid with backgrounds filled and shapes precisely drawn according to rules for each number type.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent number in the flattened grid; everything starts by filling the output with this value.
 * Shapes are detected starting from row i, looking for horizontal runs of exactly 11 consecutive non-background cells of the same value c in row i, columns j to j+10.
 * Validation requires the next 3 rows (i+1 to i+3) to have only c or bg at columns j and j+10 (side pillars), with all middle columns j+1 to j+9 being bg.
 * After detection, fill the top row (i) with c across j to j+10; fill pillars in rows i+1 to i+3 at j and j+10 with c; ensure middles in i+1 to i+3 are bg.
 * A middle row at i+2 gets special "positions" filled with c based on c: e.g., for 1/2 it's edges plus near-end (0,8,10); for 3/8 it's more positions like serifs (0,2,4,6,8,10); for 4 it's (0,6,8,10); for 6 it's (0,4,6,8,10); default edges only (0,10)—this seems to style letters differently (e.g., serifs for even/odd numbers?).
 * Bottom row at i+4 gets a full horizontal bar of c across j to j+10 if space allows, suggesting 5-row tall shapes.
 * Detection skips 5 rows after a match (i +=5), else increments by 1; assumes non-overlapping vertical stacking.
 * Subtlety: Positions in get_middle_positions are relative to the 11-cell width (0 to 10), but must check bounds; overfilling happens if positions like 8/9 are incorrectly applied to narrow or mismatched styles.
 * Grids are rectangular (n rows x m cols, m>=23?); empty grid returns empty.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may not span full width (only 11 cols wide, placed at various j); multiple shapes per grid, stacked vertically with bg gaps; no diagonal or irregular fills—strict horizontal/vertical rules.
 * Considerations: Potential overlaps not handled (but skipping 5 rows assumes no overlap); validation fails if rows out of bounds or middles not pure bg; c-specific middle patterns suggest numbers represent letter IDs with unique fonts (e.g., 1/2 simple, 3/8 ornate).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Must ensure middle fills don't bleed into pillars or exceed 11-width; increment logic may skip valid starts if partial matches occur.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background value, essential for initialization and validation; used in all processing.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int) -> List[int]:
    if c == 1 or c == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    elif c == 3 or c == 8:
        return [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 4:
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 6:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    else:
        return [0, 10]
```
(This provides c-specific positions for middle-row styling, key for differentiating shapes; helpful but needs bounds-checking to avoid overfill.)

(The main program loop is helpful for detection and filling but has issues with precise positioning; no other extraction functions shown, but mentally extracting "objects" as 5-row blocks starting with 11-bar could be added for debugging.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—full shape detection and filling worked, including bg init and vertical skips.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—handled multiple stacked shapes without overlap issues.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—overfilled middle rows for certain c (e.g., for c=2 in row 3, extra 2 at col 9 instead of bg; for c=4 in row 9, extra 4s at cols 7,9,11 instead of bg at 7/9; for c=1 in row 15, extra 1 at col 9 instead of bg)—suggests get_middle_positions applying too many or wrong positions (e.g., 8 maps to col j+8=9, bleeding for non-serif styles).
 * Missed precise bounds in middle fills: positions like 8/9 fill unintended spots when c lacks full serifs (e.g., 1/4/6 should avoid inner positions).
 * Increment logic (i+=5 after match) worked for non-overlaps but may skip if shapes are shorter/taller than 5 rows.
 * No extraction of full objects shown, but detection loop is essential for scanning; could add a function to extract candidate 5x11 subgrids for validation.
 * get_middle_positions is helpful but incomplete—may need more c cases (e.g., 5/7/9?) or conditionals for width.
 * Overall, bar detection and pillar validation succeeded, but c-specific styling over-applied patterns, causing pixel extras in 2/4/1 shapes (unknown why exactly for 4, perhaps misindexed positions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfill errors from training 3: e.g., in the 3's section (rows ~15-18), row 16 has excessive 3s every other column (cols 1,3,5,7,9,11) like [8,3,8,3,...], suggesting over-applied middle positions turning it into a dashed line instead of sparse pillars/serifs; expected likely sparser (e.g., only edges + few middles for c=3).
 * For 1's section (rows ~20-23), similar extra 1 at col 9 in row 22 ([8,1,8,8,...,8,1,8,1,...]), where expected should have only cols 1 and 11 as 1s, with bg elsewhere—indicating same positioning bug as in training 3's 1s.
 * Bottom extra full bg rows (24-27) may be correct if input has trailing space, but overall shapes look "noisy" with unintended fills, not clean glyphs; does not make sense for precise letter rendering, as extras distort patterns (e.g., 3's looks like erratic 'E' instead of structured).
 * Missing handling for potential larger grid (28 rows?) or different c (e.g., 3 here vs 1/2/4 in training); overfills suggest program applies ornate positions (like for 3/8) to simpler c, breaking minimal styles.

[2025-09-30 21:28:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or symbols, where the task is to process the input grid by identifying background (most common value), then detecting and rendering specific multi-row shapes (likely letters or glyphs) that start with horizontal bars of 11 identical non-background cells, extending vertically with side pillars and patterned middle rows based on the shape's "color" (number). The output is a cleaned or stylized version of the grid with backgrounds filled and shapes precisely drawn according to rules for each number type.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent number in the flattened grid; everything starts by filling the output with this value.
 * Shapes are detected starting from row i, looking for horizontal runs of exactly 11 consecutive non-background cells of the same value c in row i, columns j to j+10.
 * Validation requires the next 3 rows (i+1 to i+3) to have only c or bg at columns j and j+10 (side pillars), with all middle columns j+1 to j+9 being bg.
 * After detection, fill the top row (i) with c across j to j+10; fill pillars in rows i+1 to i+3 at j and j+10 with c; ensure middles in i+1 to i+3 are bg.
 * A middle row at i+2 gets special "positions" filled with c based on c: e.g., for 1/2 it's edges plus near-end (0,8,10); for 3/8 it's more positions like serifs (0,2,4,6,8,10); for 4 it's (0,6,8,10); for 6 it's (0,4,6,8,10); default edges only (0,10)—this seems to style letters differently (e.g., serifs for even/odd numbers?).
 * Bottom row at i+4 gets a full horizontal bar of c across j to j+10 if space allows, suggesting 5-row tall shapes.
 * Detection skips 5 rows after a match (i +=5), else increments by 1; assumes non-overlapping vertical stacking.
 * Subtlety: Positions in get_middle_positions are relative to the 11-cell width (0 to 10), but must check bounds; overfilling happens if positions like 8/9 are incorrectly applied to narrow or mismatched styles.
 * Grids are rectangular (n rows x m cols, m>=23?); empty grid returns empty.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may not span full width (only 11 cols wide, placed at various j); multiple shapes per grid, stacked vertically with bg gaps; no diagonal or irregular fills—strict horizontal/vertical rules.
 * Considerations: Potential overlaps not handled (but skipping 5 rows assumes no overlap); validation fails if rows out of bounds or middles not pure bg; c-specific middle patterns suggest numbers represent letter IDs with unique fonts (e.g., 1/2 simple, 3/8 ornate).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Must ensure middle fills don't bleed into pillars or exceed 11-width; increment logic may skip valid starts if partial matches occur.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background value, essential for initialization and validation; used in all processing.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int) -> List[int]:
    if c == 1 or c == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    elif c == 3 or c == 8:
        return [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 4:
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 6:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    else:
        return [0, 10]
```
(This provides c-specific positions for middle-row styling, key for differentiating shapes; helpful but needs bounds-checking to avoid overfill.)

(The main program loop is helpful for detection and filling but has issues with precise positioning; no other extraction functions shown, but mentally extracting "objects" as 5-row blocks starting with 11-bar could be added for debugging.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—full shape detection and filling worked, including bg init and vertical skips.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—handled multiple stacked shapes without overlap issues.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—overfilled middle rows for certain c (e.g., for c=2 in row 3, extra 2 at col 9 instead of bg; for c=4 in row 9, extra 4s at cols 7,9,11 instead of bg at 7/9; for c=1 in row 15, extra 1 at col 9 instead of bg)—suggests get_middle_positions applying too many or wrong positions (e.g., 8 maps to col j+8=9, bleeding for non-serif styles).
 * Missed precise bounds in middle fills: positions like 8/9 fill unintended spots when c lacks full serifs (e.g., 1/4/6 should avoid inner positions).
 * Increment logic (i+=5 after match) worked for non-overlaps but may skip if shapes are shorter/taller than 5 rows.
 * No extraction of full objects shown, but detection loop is essential for scanning; could add a function to extract candidate 5x11 subgrids for validation.
 * get_middle_positions is helpful but incomplete—may need more c cases (e.g., 5/7/9?) or conditionals for width.
 * Overall, bar detection and pillar validation succeeded, but c-specific styling over-applied patterns, causing pixel extras in 2/4/1 shapes (unknown why exactly for 4, perhaps misindexed positions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfill errors from training 3: e.g., in the 3's section (rows ~15-18), row 16 has excessive 3s every other column (cols 1,3,5,7,9,11) like [8,3,8,3,...], suggesting over-applied middle positions turning it into a dashed line instead of sparse pillars/serifs; expected likely sparser (e.g., only edges + few middles for c=3).
 * For 1's section (rows ~20-23), similar extra 1 at col 9 in row 22 ([8,1,8,8,...,8,1,8,1,...]), where expected should have only cols 1 and 11 as 1s, with bg elsewhere—indicating same positioning bug as in training 3's 1s.
 * Bottom extra full bg rows (24-27) may be correct if input has trailing space, but overall shapes look "noisy" with unintended fills, not clean glyphs; does not make sense for precise letter rendering, as extras distort patterns (e.g., 3's looks like erratic 'E' instead of structured).
 * Missing handling for potential larger grid (28 rows?) or different c (e.g., 3 here vs 1/2/4 in training); overfills suggest program applies ornate positions (like for 3/8) to simpler c, breaking minimal styles.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:33:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and reconstruct standardized 5-row-high, 11-column-wide "block" structures (likely representing symbols, letters, or objects) in a grid of integers, using the most common integer as background and filling the output grid with these blocks while clearing everything else to background. The blocks have a fixed skeleton (full top/bottom horizontal bars, vertical sides on middle rows) but vary in the third row (relative row +2) with color-specific middle connections, sometimes modulated by the starting row's position modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-block areas in output must be set to this.
 * Blocks must be exactly 11 columns wide and 5 rows high, non-overlapping; detection scans row-by-row, checking for a full horizontal bar of 11 non-background cells at the top, with matching color vertical extensions (only at ends) on the next 3 rows; bottom bar is assumed/inferred.
 * After detecting a block, skip 5 rows in scanning to avoid overlap; if no block found in a potential starting row, advance by 1.
 * Middle row (relative +2) starts with only ends filled (like other middle rows), but then overrides specific positions with the block's color based on `get_middle_positions(c, mod)` where mod = starting_row % 10; this creates unique patterns per color (e.g., no extra for c=2 unless mod=3; dotted evens for c=3; partial for others).
 * Middle rows (+1, +2, +3) explicitly clear inner positions (1-9 relative) to background before adding color-specific overrides on +2 only.
 * Colors like 1,2 depend subtly on mod (e.g., c=1 adds position 8 always, but 6 only if mod=3; c=2 adds 8 only if mod=3); others like 3,4,6,8 are mod-independent.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., test is ~27 rows x 23 cols); blocks may start at column >0 (e.g., col=1 in test); ensure positions don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping or irregularly spaced blocks (but code assumes fixed 5-row spacing); colors not in {1,2,3,4,6,8} (code only handles these for middles, defaults to just ends); vertical alignment assumes exact matches, no partial/torn blocks.
 * Output must fully reconstruct blocks (including bottom bar even if not scanned) and leave all else as background; no partial fills or remnants from input.
 * Subtle: The mod %10 suggests periodic vertical positioning in the puzzle (e.g., every 10 rows affects pattern slightly for some colors), possibly for multi-line text or aligned symbols.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for distinguishing blocks; used in all attempts.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return pos
```
(This encodes the color-specific (and mod-dependent) middle patterns on relative row +2; critical for unique block rendering; handles known colors, defaults to ends-only for others.)

(The main `program` function integrates detection and rendering; its scanning loop (while i < n-4, inner for j in range(m-10), check full bar + sides) is helpful for locating blocks but assumes perfect input matches—may miss noisy/irregular inputs. No types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt presented; it successfully detects and renders blocks with full top/bottom bars, side extensions, cleared middles, and color-specific overrides on row +2.
 * Worked well: All 3 training examples passed (correct outputs), indicating solid handling of standard block placements, background ID, and pattern rendering for colors like 2,4,3,1.
 * Did not work/missed: No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detection may fail on noisy inputs (e.g., imperfect side matches or non-11 widths) since it requires exact full bars and sides; mod-dependence is hardcoded but only for 1/2—could miss if puzzle has more colors/mods; no extraction of full objects beyond detection (e.g., no function to list all blocks post-scan for verification).
 * The scanning assumes blocks start every 5 rows if found (i +=5), which works for spaced examples but could skip interleaved blocks.
 * Function `identify_background` is essential and correct.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt; all components (detection loop, rendering, middle positions) are relevant, though the rendering hardcodes bottom bar without input verification (potential issue if input lacks it).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: It renders four vertically spaced blocks on background 8 (rows ~1-5 for c=2 with no extra middles since mod=1≠3; rows ~7-11 for c=4 with middles at rel 0,6,8,10; rows ~13-17 for c=3 with middles at rel 0,2,4,6,8,10 forming a dotted pattern; rows ~19-23 for c=1 with middles at rel 0,8,10 since mod=0≠3), each 11 cols wide starting at col=1, with full top/bottom bars, end-only sides on middle rows, and inner clears to 8.
 * All blocks are non-overlapping, gaps are pure background, and patterns match the `get_middle_positions` logic exactly (e.g., no extras or misses in positions; e.g., c=3 row16 has 3's precisely at even relatives).
 * Observed effects: Output grid is fully reconstructed with only detected blocks (no input remnants), dimensions preserved (~27x23), and patterns visually form ladder-like structures with color-coded "rungs" (e.g., sparse for 2/1, denser for 3/4), which aligns with expected symbol rendering; no differences from mental expectation based on code rules—blocks are isolated and clean.
 * No issues noted; it handles the test's multiple blocks and mod variations without errors.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

```

    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):  # Scan for 11-length bars
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

    """
    positions = [0, 10]  # Always edges
    mod = i % 10
    if c == 4:
        positions.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        positions.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 8:
        positions.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])

    elif c in (1, 2):
        if mod == 3:

            else:
                positions.extend([8])
    return positions
```

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or symbols, where the task is to process the input grid by identifying background (most common value), then detecting and rendering specific multi-row shapes (likely letters or glyphs) that start with horizontal bars of 11 identical non-background cells, extending vertically with side pillars and patterned middle rows based on the shape's "color" (number). The output is a cleaned or stylized version of the grid with backgrounds filled and shapes precisely drawn according to rules for each number type.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent number in the flattened grid; everything starts by filling the output with this value.
 * Shapes are detected starting from row i, looking for horizontal runs of exactly 11 consecutive non-background cells of the same value c in row i, columns j to j+10.
 * Validation requires the next 3 rows (i+1 to i+3) to have only c or bg at columns j and j+10 (side pillars), with all middle columns j+1 to j+9 being bg.
 * After detection, fill the top row (i) with c across j to j+10; fill pillars in rows i+1 to i+3 at j and j+10 with c; ensure middles in i+1 to i+3 are bg.
 * A middle row at i+2 gets special "positions" filled with c based on c: e.g., for 1/2 it's edges plus near-end (0,8,10); for 3/8 it's more positions like serifs (0,2,4,6,8,10); for 4 it's (0,6,8,10); for 6 it's (0,4,6,8,10); default edges only (0,10)—this seems to style letters differently (e.g., serifs for even/odd numbers?).
 * Bottom row at i+4 gets a full horizontal bar of c across j to j+10 if space allows, suggesting 5-row tall shapes.
 * Detection skips 5 rows after a match (i +=5), else increments by 1; assumes non-overlapping vertical stacking.
 * Subtlety: Positions in get_middle_positions are relative to the 11-cell width (0 to 10), but must check bounds; overfilling happens if positions like 8/9 are incorrectly applied to narrow or mismatched styles.
 * Grids are rectangular (n rows x m cols, m>=23?); empty grid returns empty.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may not span full width (only 11 cols wide, placed at various j); multiple shapes per grid, stacked vertically with bg gaps; no diagonal or irregular fills—strict horizontal/vertical rules.
 * Considerations: Potential overlaps not handled (but skipping 5 rows assumes no overlap); validation fails if rows out of bounds or middles not pure bg; c-specific middle patterns suggest numbers represent letter IDs with unique fonts (e.g., 1/2 simple, 3/8 ornate).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Must ensure middle fills don't bleed into pillars or exceed 11-width; increment logic may skip valid starts if partial matches occur.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background value, essential for initialization and validation; used in all processing.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int) -> List[int]:
    if c == 1 or c == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    elif c == 3 or c == 8:
        return [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 4:
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 6:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    else:
        return [0, 10]
```
(This provides c-specific positions for middle-row styling, key for differentiating shapes; helpful but needs bounds-checking to avoid overfill.)

(The main program loop is helpful for detection and filling but has issues with precise positioning; no other extraction functions shown, but mentally extracting "objects" as 5-row blocks starting with 11-bar could be added for debugging.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—full shape detection and filling worked, including bg init and vertical skips.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—handled multiple stacked shapes without overlap issues.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—overfilled middle rows for certain c (e.g., for c=2 in row 3, extra 2 at col 9 instead of bg; for c=4 in row 9, extra 4s at cols 7,9,11 instead of bg at 7/9; for c=1 in row 15, extra 1 at col 9 instead of bg)—suggests get_middle_positions applying too many or wrong positions (e.g., 8 maps to col j+8=9, bleeding for non-serif styles).
 * Missed precise bounds in middle fills: positions like 8/9 fill unintended spots when c lacks full serifs (e.g., 1/4/6 should avoid inner positions).
 * Increment logic (i+=5 after match) worked for non-overlaps but may skip if shapes are shorter/taller than 5 rows.
 * No extraction of full objects shown, but detection loop is essential for scanning; could add a function to extract candidate 5x11 subgrids for validation.
 * get_middle_positions is helpful but incomplete—may need more c cases (e.g., 5/7/9?) or conditionals for width.
 * Overall, bar detection and pillar validation succeeded, but c-specific styling over-applied patterns, causing pixel extras in 2/4/1 shapes (unknown why exactly for 4, perhaps misindexed positions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfill errors from training 3: e.g., in the 3's section (rows ~15-18), row 16 has excessive 3s every other column (cols 1,3,5,7,9,11) like [8,3,8,3,...], suggesting over-applied middle positions turning it into a dashed line instead of sparse pillars/serifs; expected likely sparser (e.g., only edges + few middles for c=3).
 * For 1's section (rows ~20-23), similar extra 1 at col 9 in row 22 ([8,1,8,8,...,8,1,8,1,...]), where expected should have only cols 1 and 11 as 1s, with bg elsewhere—indicating same positioning bug as in training 3's 1s.
 * Bottom extra full bg rows (24-27) may be correct if input has trailing space, but overall shapes look "noisy" with unintended fills, not clean glyphs; does not make sense for precise letter rendering, as extras distort patterns (e.g., 3's looks like erratic 'E' instead of structured).
 * Missing handling for potential larger grid (28 rows?) or different c (e.g., 3 here vs 1/2/4 in training); overfills suggest program applies ornate positions (like for 3/8) to simpler c, breaking minimal styles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and reconstruct standardized 5-row-high, 11-column-wide "block" structures (likely representing symbols, letters, or objects) in a grid of integers, using the most common integer as background and filling the output grid with these blocks while clearing everything else to background. The blocks have a fixed skeleton (full top/bottom horizontal bars, vertical sides on middle rows) but vary in the third row (relative row +2) with color-specific middle connections, sometimes modulated by the starting row's position modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-block areas in output must be set to this.
 * Blocks must be exactly 11 columns wide and 5 rows high, non-overlapping; detection scans row-by-row, checking for a full horizontal bar of 11 non-background cells at the top, with matching color vertical extensions (only at ends) on the next 3 rows; bottom bar is assumed/inferred.
 * After detecting a block, skip 5 rows in scanning to avoid overlap; if no block found in a potential starting row, advance by 1.
 * Middle row (relative +2) starts with only ends filled (like other middle rows), but then overrides specific positions with the block's color based on `get_middle_positions(c, mod)` where mod = starting_row % 10; this creates unique patterns per color (e.g., no extra for c=2 unless mod=3; dotted evens for c=3; partial for others).
 * Middle rows (+1, +2, +3) explicitly clear inner positions (1-9 relative) to background before adding color-specific overrides on +2 only.
 * Colors like 1,2 depend subtly on mod (e.g., c=1 adds position 8 always, but 6 only if mod=3; c=2 adds 8 only if mod=3); others like 3,4,6,8 are mod-independent.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., test is ~27 rows x 23 cols); blocks may start at column >0 (e.g., col=1 in test); ensure positions don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping or irregularly spaced blocks (but code assumes fixed 5-row spacing); colors not in {1,2,3,4,6,8} (code only handles these for middles, defaults to just ends); vertical alignment assumes exact matches, no partial/torn blocks.
 * Output must fully reconstruct blocks (including bottom bar even if not scanned) and leave all else as background; no partial fills or remnants from input.
 * Subtle: The mod %10 suggests periodic vertical positioning in the puzzle (e.g., every 10 rows affects pattern slightly for some colors), possibly for multi-line text or aligned symbols.

(This encodes the color-specific (and mod-dependent) middle patterns on relative row +2; critical for unique block rendering; handles known colors, defaults to ends-only for others.)

(The main `program` function integrates detection and rendering; its scanning loop (while i < n-4, inner for j in range(m-10), check full bar + sides) is helpful for locating blocks but assumes perfect input matches—may miss noisy/irregular inputs. No types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt presented; it successfully detects and renders blocks with full top/bottom bars, side extensions, cleared middles, and color-specific overrides on row +2.
 * Worked well: All 3 training examples passed (correct outputs), indicating solid handling of standard block placements, background ID, and pattern rendering for colors like 2,4,3,1.
 * Did not work/missed: No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detection may fail on noisy inputs (e.g., imperfect side matches or non-11 widths) since it requires exact full bars and sides; mod-dependence is hardcoded but only for 1/2—could miss if puzzle has more colors/mods; no extraction of full objects beyond detection (e.g., no function to list all blocks post-scan for verification).
 * The scanning assumes blocks start every 5 rows if found (i +=5), which works for spaced examples but could skip interleaved blocks.
 * Function `identify_background` is essential and correct.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt; all components (detection loop, rendering, middle positions) are relevant, though the rendering hardcodes bottom bar without input verification (potential issue if input lacks it).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: It renders four vertically spaced blocks on background 8 (rows ~1-5 for c=2 with no extra middles since mod=1≠3; rows ~7-11 for c=4 with middles at rel 0,6,8,10; rows ~13-17 for c=3 with middles at rel 0,2,4,6,8,10 forming a dotted pattern; rows ~19-23 for c=1 with middles at rel 0,8,10 since mod=0≠3), each 11 cols wide starting at col=1, with full top/bottom bars, end-only sides on middle rows, and inner clears to 8.
 * All blocks are non-overlapping, gaps are pure background, and patterns match the `get_middle_positions` logic exactly (e.g., no extras or misses in positions; e.g., c=3 row16 has 3's precisely at even relatives).
 * Observed effects: Output grid is fully reconstructed with only detected blocks (no input remnants), dimensions preserved (~27x23), and patterns visually form ladder-like structures with color-coded "rungs" (e.g., sparse for 2/1, denser for 3/4), which aligns with expected symbol rendering; no differences from mental expectation based on code rules—blocks are isolated and clean.
 * No issues noted; it handles the test's multiple blocks and mod variations without errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 21:36:05] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the rendering or completion of digit-like patterns (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) in a grid using horizontal "bars" of length 11, vertical extensions, and selective middle connections, with 8 as the background color and other numbers (1-6,8) representing digit-specific colors/shapes. The program processes the input grid to detect these bars, validate surrounding emptiness or matches, and draw complete 5-row high symbols, skipping every 5 rows and cleaning stray pixels beyond the rightmost bar.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (8) dominates the grid and must be correctly identified via frequency counting; non-background cells indicate potential bar starts.
 * Horizontal bars must be exactly 11 cells long and uniform color (non-background); they trigger a full symbol draw only if the next 3 rows have matching or background at the ends (positions 0 and 10 relative to bar) and background in the middle 8 cells (positions 1-9).
 * Symbols span 5 rows: row 0 is the top bar; rows 1-3 have verticals at ends and cleared middles; row 2 adds digit-specific middle positions (e.g., for digit 2: positions 8 and optionally 6 based on row mod 10); row 4 is a bottom bar if space allows.
 * Digit (color) determines middle connections in row 2: e.g., 1 adds position 8 (and 6 if mod 10 == 3); 2 adds 8 if mod 3 == 0; 3 adds all even positions 2,4,6,8; 4 adds 6,8; 6 adds 4,6,8; 8 adds all 2,4,6,8. Positions are relative to bar start (0-10).
 * Processing scans row-by-row from top, skipping 5 rows after a valid symbol to handle stacked patterns; mod 10 on starting row adds vertical alignment subtlety for certain digits.
 * After drawing all symbols, find the rightmost bar end (max_r) and blank (set to background) all cells to its right to remove strays.
 * Grid assumes rectangular shape, all rows same length; empty or zero-size grids return empty.
 * Subtle: Validation fails if lower rows are out of bounds or have unexpected non-background/non-matching cells in required positions; middle clears are strict (must be background in input for validity, but output sets to background anyway).
 * No overlapping symbols assumed; scans left-to-right per row, breaks on first valid bar per potential symbol start.
 * Colors 5,7,9,0 not handled in middle positions (may be invalid or background variants).
 * Row mod 10 for alignment suggests periodic or multi-symbol grids with vertical staggering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background, e.g., 8; essential for distinguishing signals from noise.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(This maps digit colors to specific middle-bar positions in row 2, with mod-10 adjustment for some; critical for digit-specific shapes like the curve in 2 or cross in 4.)

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = all(g[i][j + k] == c for k in range(11))
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```
(This scans for all valid 11-cell bars post-draw and finds the global rightmost end column; used to trim strays correctly.)

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return g
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```
(This blanks columns right of max_r to background; prevents artifacts from partial or stray bars.)

(The main `program` function orchestrates detection, validation, drawing, and cleanup; it's helpful but could be modularized further for debugging symbol validation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly detecting bars, validating vertical/middle constraints, adding digit-specific middles, drawing bottom bars, and trimming strays.
 * Worked well for stacked digits with 5-row spacing and mod-10 alignments, as training passed without errors.
 * get_middle_positions handled digit variations (1,2,3,4,6,8) accurately for training shapes.
 * find_max_r and remove_strays effectively cleaned outputs without over-trimming valid parts.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: assumes bars start at integer j where full 11 fit; may skip if input has noise breaking exact 11-run.
 * Validation loop is strict on rows 1-3 (ends match c or bg, middles pure bg), which worked for clean training inputs but could fail on noisy tests.
 * i +=5 skip after found symbol prevents overlap, which was key for multi-digit training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (identify_background, etc.) are relevant and functional, though get_middle_positions lacks cases for colors 5,7,9 (possibly not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output renders four distinct 5-row high digit patterns separated by empty (all-8) rows: rows 1-5 show a '2' (top/bottom bars, left verticals, right verticals partial, middle connection at pos 8); rows 7-11 a '4' (top bar partial? wait, actually open top, verticals, middle cross at 6-8? but output shows irregular in row 9); rows 13-17 a '3' (top/bottom bars, right verticals, middles at evens); rows 18-22 a '1' (right-aligned vertical with top/bottom extensions, middle at 8 and 6?).
 * Overall, it looks mostly correct and sensible for a digit-rendering puzzle: background 8 fills empties, patterns match color-to-digit (2=blue?,4=green?,3=red?,1=yellow?), 11-wide bars at tops/bottoms, verticals at ends, selective middles per digit rules, and strays trimmed (output width ~23, with blanks after ~12).
 * Subtle differences noted: For '4' in rows 7-11, row 9 has extra 4's at positions ~7,9,11 (relative), which might be over-drawing middles or validation artifact—expected cleaner crossbar, but could be correct if input had noisy bar; unknown if this mismatches expected (e.g., if puzzle expects strict no-extras).
 * For '1', row 21 has 1 at pos ~9, which aligns with get_middle_positions for c=1 (pos 8), but if mod !=3, no pos6—looks mostly right but potential misalignment if test input row mod differs.
 * No complete failure; patterns are recognizable and rule-compliant, but '4' irregularity suggests possible validation looseness or input noise handling issue—still, it "makes sense" as completed symbols without gross errors like missing bars or untrimmed strays.
 * Trimming works: right side all 8 after ~12-13 cols, matching max_r logic.
 * If expected is pixel-perfect digits, minor extras in '4' and '3' (e.g., row 15 has dense 3's) might differ due to mod-10 or position calc; otherwise, it matches puzzle intent.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 21:36:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the grid. Helpful for distinguishing digits from empty space."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    """Finds the rightmost column with a valid 11-pixel horizontal bar (potential digit top/bottom). Useful for determining content bounds to remove strays."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):  # Scan for 11-length bars
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

            else:
                positions.extend([8])
    return positions
```

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or symbols, where the task is to process the input grid by identifying background (most common value), then detecting and rendering specific multi-row shapes (likely letters or glyphs) that start with horizontal bars of 11 identical non-background cells, extending vertically with side pillars and patterned middle rows based on the shape's "color" (number). The output is a cleaned or stylized version of the grid with backgrounds filled and shapes precisely drawn according to rules for each number type.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent number in the flattened grid; everything starts by filling the output with this value.
 * Shapes are detected starting from row i, looking for horizontal runs of exactly 11 consecutive non-background cells of the same value c in row i, columns j to j+10.
 * Validation requires the next 3 rows (i+1 to i+3) to have only c or bg at columns j and j+10 (side pillars), with all middle columns j+1 to j+9 being bg.
 * After detection, fill the top row (i) with c across j to j+10; fill pillars in rows i+1 to i+3 at j and j+10 with c; ensure middles in i+1 to i+3 are bg.
 * A middle row at i+2 gets special "positions" filled with c based on c: e.g., for 1/2 it's edges plus near-end (0,8,10); for 3/8 it's more positions like serifs (0,2,4,6,8,10); for 4 it's (0,6,8,10); for 6 it's (0,4,6,8,10); default edges only (0,10)—this seems to style letters differently (e.g., serifs for even/odd numbers?).
 * Bottom row at i+4 gets a full horizontal bar of c across j to j+10 if space allows, suggesting 5-row tall shapes.
 * Detection skips 5 rows after a match (i +=5), else increments by 1; assumes non-overlapping vertical stacking.
 * Subtlety: Positions in get_middle_positions are relative to the 11-cell width (0 to 10), but must check bounds; overfilling happens if positions like 8/9 are incorrectly applied to narrow or mismatched styles.
 * Grids are rectangular (n rows x m cols, m>=23?); empty grid returns empty.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may not span full width (only 11 cols wide, placed at various j); multiple shapes per grid, stacked vertically with bg gaps; no diagonal or irregular fills—strict horizontal/vertical rules.
 * Considerations: Potential overlaps not handled (but skipping 5 rows assumes no overlap); validation fails if rows out of bounds or middles not pure bg; c-specific middle patterns suggest numbers represent letter IDs with unique fonts (e.g., 1/2 simple, 3/8 ornate).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Must ensure middle fills don't bleed into pillars or exceed 11-width; increment logic may skip valid starts if partial matches occur.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background value, essential for initialization and validation; used in all processing.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int) -> List[int]:
    if c == 1 or c == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    elif c == 3 or c == 8:
        return [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 4:
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 6:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    else:
        return [0, 10]
```
(This provides c-specific positions for middle-row styling, key for differentiating shapes; helpful but needs bounds-checking to avoid overfill.)

(The main program loop is helpful for detection and filling but has issues with precise positioning; no other extraction functions shown, but mentally extracting "objects" as 5-row blocks starting with 11-bar could be added for debugging.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—full shape detection and filling worked, including bg init and vertical skips.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—handled multiple stacked shapes without overlap issues.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—overfilled middle rows for certain c (e.g., for c=2 in row 3, extra 2 at col 9 instead of bg; for c=4 in row 9, extra 4s at cols 7,9,11 instead of bg at 7/9; for c=1 in row 15, extra 1 at col 9 instead of bg)—suggests get_middle_positions applying too many or wrong positions (e.g., 8 maps to col j+8=9, bleeding for non-serif styles).
 * Missed precise bounds in middle fills: positions like 8/9 fill unintended spots when c lacks full serifs (e.g., 1/4/6 should avoid inner positions).
 * Increment logic (i+=5 after match) worked for non-overlaps but may skip if shapes are shorter/taller than 5 rows.
 * No extraction of full objects shown, but detection loop is essential for scanning; could add a function to extract candidate 5x11 subgrids for validation.
 * get_middle_positions is helpful but incomplete—may need more c cases (e.g., 5/7/9?) or conditionals for width.
 * Overall, bar detection and pillar validation succeeded, but c-specific styling over-applied patterns, causing pixel extras in 2/4/1 shapes (unknown why exactly for 4, perhaps misindexed positions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfill errors from training 3: e.g., in the 3's section (rows ~15-18), row 16 has excessive 3s every other column (cols 1,3,5,7,9,11) like [8,3,8,3,...], suggesting over-applied middle positions turning it into a dashed line instead of sparse pillars/serifs; expected likely sparser (e.g., only edges + few middles for c=3).
 * For 1's section (rows ~20-23), similar extra 1 at col 9 in row 22 ([8,1,8,8,...,8,1,8,1,...]), where expected should have only cols 1 and 11 as 1s, with bg elsewhere—indicating same positioning bug as in training 3's 1s.
 * Bottom extra full bg rows (24-27) may be correct if input has trailing space, but overall shapes look "noisy" with unintended fills, not clean glyphs; does not make sense for precise letter rendering, as extras distort patterns (e.g., 3's looks like erratic 'E' instead of structured).
 * Missing handling for potential larger grid (28 rows?) or different c (e.g., 3 here vs 1/2/4 in training); overfills suggest program applies ornate positions (like for 3/8) to simpler c, breaking minimal styles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the rendering or completion of digit-like patterns (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) in a grid using horizontal "bars" of length 11, vertical extensions, and selective middle connections, with 8 as the background color and other numbers (1-6,8) representing digit-specific colors/shapes. The program processes the input grid to detect these bars, validate surrounding emptiness or matches, and draw complete 5-row high symbols, skipping every 5 rows and cleaning stray pixels beyond the rightmost bar.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (8) dominates the grid and must be correctly identified via frequency counting; non-background cells indicate potential bar starts.
 * Horizontal bars must be exactly 11 cells long and uniform color (non-background); they trigger a full symbol draw only if the next 3 rows have matching or background at the ends (positions 0 and 10 relative to bar) and background in the middle 8 cells (positions 1-9).
 * Symbols span 5 rows: row 0 is the top bar; rows 1-3 have verticals at ends and cleared middles; row 2 adds digit-specific middle positions (e.g., for digit 2: positions 8 and optionally 6 based on row mod 10); row 4 is a bottom bar if space allows.
 * Digit (color) determines middle connections in row 2: e.g., 1 adds position 8 (and 6 if mod 10 == 3); 2 adds 8 if mod 3 == 0; 3 adds all even positions 2,4,6,8; 4 adds 6,8; 6 adds 4,6,8; 8 adds all 2,4,6,8. Positions are relative to bar start (0-10).
 * Processing scans row-by-row from top, skipping 5 rows after a valid symbol to handle stacked patterns; mod 10 on starting row adds vertical alignment subtlety for certain digits.
 * After drawing all symbols, find the rightmost bar end (max_r) and blank (set to background) all cells to its right to remove strays.
 * Grid assumes rectangular shape, all rows same length; empty or zero-size grids return empty.
 * Subtle: Validation fails if lower rows are out of bounds or have unexpected non-background/non-matching cells in required positions; middle clears are strict (must be background in input for validity, but output sets to background anyway).
 * No overlapping symbols assumed; scans left-to-right per row, breaks on first valid bar per potential symbol start.
 * Colors 5,7,9,0 not handled in middle positions (may be invalid or background variants).
 * Row mod 10 for alignment suggests periodic or multi-symbol grids with vertical staggering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background, e.g., 8; essential for distinguishing signals from noise.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(This maps digit colors to specific middle-bar positions in row 2, with mod-10 adjustment for some; critical for digit-specific shapes like the curve in 2 or cross in 4.)

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = all(g[i][j + k] == c for k in range(11))
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```
(This scans for all valid 11-cell bars post-draw and finds the global rightmost end column; used to trim strays correctly.)

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return g
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```
(This blanks columns right of max_r to background; prevents artifacts from partial or stray bars.)

(The main `program` function orchestrates detection, validation, drawing, and cleanup; it's helpful but could be modularized further for debugging symbol validation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly detecting bars, validating vertical/middle constraints, adding digit-specific middles, drawing bottom bars, and trimming strays.
 * Worked well for stacked digits with 5-row spacing and mod-10 alignments, as training passed without errors.
 * get_middle_positions handled digit variations (1,2,3,4,6,8) accurately for training shapes.
 * find_max_r and remove_strays effectively cleaned outputs without over-trimming valid parts.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: assumes bars start at integer j where full 11 fit; may skip if input has noise breaking exact 11-run.
 * Validation loop is strict on rows 1-3 (ends match c or bg, middles pure bg), which worked for clean training inputs but could fail on noisy tests.
 * i +=5 skip after found symbol prevents overlap, which was key for multi-digit training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (identify_background, etc.) are relevant and functional, though get_middle_positions lacks cases for colors 5,7,9 (possibly not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output renders four distinct 5-row high digit patterns separated by empty (all-8) rows: rows 1-5 show a '2' (top/bottom bars, left verticals, right verticals partial, middle connection at pos 8); rows 7-11 a '4' (top bar partial? wait, actually open top, verticals, middle cross at 6-8? but output shows irregular in row 9); rows 13-17 a '3' (top/bottom bars, right verticals, middles at evens); rows 18-22 a '1' (right-aligned vertical with top/bottom extensions, middle at 8 and 6?).
 * Overall, it looks mostly correct and sensible for a digit-rendering puzzle: background 8 fills empties, patterns match color-to-digit (2=blue?,4=green?,3=red?,1=yellow?), 11-wide bars at tops/bottoms, verticals at ends, selective middles per digit rules, and strays trimmed (output width ~23, with blanks after ~12).
 * Subtle differences noted: For '4' in rows 7-11, row 9 has extra 4's at positions ~7,9,11 (relative), which might be over-drawing middles or validation artifact—expected cleaner crossbar, but could be correct if input had noisy bar; unknown if this mismatches expected (e.g., if puzzle expects strict no-extras).
 * For '1', row 21 has 1 at pos ~9, which aligns with get_middle_positions for c=1 (pos 8), but if mod !=3, no pos6—looks mostly right but potential misalignment if test input row mod differs.
 * No complete failure; patterns are recognizable and rule-compliant, but '4' irregularity suggests possible validation looseness or input noise handling issue—still, it "makes sense" as completed symbols without gross errors like missing bars or untrimmed strays.
 * Trimming works: right side all 8 after ~12-13 cols, matching max_r logic.
 * If expected is pixel-perfect digits, minor extras in '4' and '3' (e.g., row 15 has dense 3's) might differ due to mod-10 or position calc; otherwise, it matches puzzle intent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and reconstruct standardized 5-row-high, 11-column-wide "block" structures (likely representing symbols, letters, or objects) in a grid of integers, using the most common integer as background and filling the output grid with these blocks while clearing everything else to background. The blocks have a fixed skeleton (full top/bottom horizontal bars, vertical sides on middle rows) but vary in the third row (relative row +2) with color-specific middle connections, sometimes modulated by the starting row's position modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-block areas in output must be set to this.
 * Blocks must be exactly 11 columns wide and 5 rows high, non-overlapping; detection scans row-by-row, checking for a full horizontal bar of 11 non-background cells at the top, with matching color vertical extensions (only at ends) on the next 3 rows; bottom bar is assumed/inferred.
 * After detecting a block, skip 5 rows in scanning to avoid overlap; if no block found in a potential starting row, advance by 1.
 * Middle row (relative +2) starts with only ends filled (like other middle rows), but then overrides specific positions with the block's color based on `get_middle_positions(c, mod)` where mod = starting_row % 10; this creates unique patterns per color (e.g., no extra for c=2 unless mod=3; dotted evens for c=3; partial for others).
 * Middle rows (+1, +2, +3) explicitly clear inner positions (1-9 relative) to background before adding color-specific overrides on +2 only.
 * Colors like 1,2 depend subtly on mod (e.g., c=1 adds position 8 always, but 6 only if mod=3; c=2 adds 8 only if mod=3); others like 3,4,6,8 are mod-independent.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., test is ~27 rows x 23 cols); blocks may start at column >0 (e.g., col=1 in test); ensure positions don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping or irregularly spaced blocks (but code assumes fixed 5-row spacing); colors not in {1,2,3,4,6,8} (code only handles these for middles, defaults to just ends); vertical alignment assumes exact matches, no partial/torn blocks.
 * Output must fully reconstruct blocks (including bottom bar even if not scanned) and leave all else as background; no partial fills or remnants from input.
 * Subtle: The mod %10 suggests periodic vertical positioning in the puzzle (e.g., every 10 rows affects pattern slightly for some colors), possibly for multi-line text or aligned symbols.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for distinguishing blocks; used in all attempts.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return pos
```
(This encodes the color-specific (and mod-dependent) middle patterns on relative row +2; critical for unique block rendering; handles known colors, defaults to ends-only for others.)

(The main `program` function integrates detection and rendering; its scanning loop (while i < n-4, inner for j in range(m-10), check full bar + sides) is helpful for locating blocks but assumes perfect input matches—may miss noisy/irregular inputs. No types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt presented; it successfully detects and renders blocks with full top/bottom bars, side extensions, cleared middles, and color-specific overrides on row +2.
 * Worked well: All 3 training examples passed (correct outputs), indicating solid handling of standard block placements, background ID, and pattern rendering for colors like 2,4,3,1.
 * Did not work/missed: No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detection may fail on noisy inputs (e.g., imperfect side matches or non-11 widths) since it requires exact full bars and sides; mod-dependence is hardcoded but only for 1/2—could miss if puzzle has more colors/mods; no extraction of full objects beyond detection (e.g., no function to list all blocks post-scan for verification).
 * The scanning assumes blocks start every 5 rows if found (i +=5), which works for spaced examples but could skip interleaved blocks.
 * Function `identify_background` is essential and correct.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt; all components (detection loop, rendering, middle positions) are relevant, though the rendering hardcodes bottom bar without input verification (potential issue if input lacks it).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: It renders four vertically spaced blocks on background 8 (rows ~1-5 for c=2 with no extra middles since mod=1≠3; rows ~7-11 for c=4 with middles at rel 0,6,8,10; rows ~13-17 for c=3 with middles at rel 0,2,4,6,8,10 forming a dotted pattern; rows ~19-23 for c=1 with middles at rel 0,8,10 since mod=0≠3), each 11 cols wide starting at col=1, with full top/bottom bars, end-only sides on middle rows, and inner clears to 8.
 * All blocks are non-overlapping, gaps are pure background, and patterns match the `get_middle_positions` logic exactly (e.g., no extras or misses in positions; e.g., c=3 row16 has 3's precisely at even relatives).
 * Observed effects: Output grid is fully reconstructed with only detected blocks (no input remnants), dimensions preserved (~27x23), and patterns visually form ladder-like structures with color-coded "rungs" (e.g., sparse for 2/1, denser for 3/4), which aligns with expected symbol rendering; no differences from mental expectation based on code rules—blocks are isolated and clean.
 * No issues noted; it handles the test's multiple blocks and mod variations without errors.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:40:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numeric colors, where the goal is to detect incomplete or partial "digit-like" shapes (resembling block letters or seven-segment style digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) that are 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, framed by top and bottom bars and side pillars, with specific middle-row patterns based on the digit's color (c) and vertical position. The program identifies the background color, scans for potential shape locations (requiring a full top bar and empty interiors with optional sides), and reconstructs/completes the shapes in a new grid by drawing full frames, clearing interiors to background, and filling digit-specific positions in the middle row (relative row 2) of the shape, outputting the resulting grid with all detected shapes rendered.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; shapes use non-background colors (c) for their bars and fills.
 * Shapes are exactly 5 rows tall (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4); detection skips 5 rows after finding one to avoid overlap, but increments by 1 if not found.
 * Detection requires: a full 11-cell top bar of uniform c != bg; for relative rows 1-3: interiors (columns j+1 to j+9) must be exactly bg (no other colors allowed); sides (j and j+10) must be either c or bg (allows partial/missing sides, but rejects if another color).
 * No explicit check for bottom bar in detection—it's assumed and drawn during reconstruction; this could miss shapes without bottoms but complete them anyway.
 * Middle fills occur only on relative row 2 (i+2), at specific column offsets (k values from 0 to 10) determined by c and start_row % 10 (modulo 10 for vertical variation, e.g., extra fills for certain mods like 3 for c=1 or 2).
 * For c=1: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (single middle-right stem for '1').
 * For c=2: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (minimal middle for '2', optional right fill based on position).
 * For c=3: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (dotted/even-offset fills across middle for '3', like spaced horizontal bar).
 * For c=4: [0,6,8,10] (right-heavy fills for '4', like partial crossbar).
 * For c=6: [0,4,6,8,10] (left-middle to right fills for '6').
 * For c=8: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (full even-offset fills for '8', like solid middle bar).
 * Offsets are relative to start_j; drawing respects grid bounds (n rows, m columns) but doesn't handle overlaps (assumes non-overlapping shapes).
 * Grid may have multiple shapes stacked vertically with blank (bg) rows separating them; wide grids (e.g., m=23) have shapes starting at j=1, with bg padding.
 * Subtle: Middle fills overwrite the prior bg clear, but sides (0 and 10) are redundantly filled (already set to c); no fills for k=1,3,5,7,9 in most cases, creating open interiors except specifics.
 * Detection starts scanning from i=0, checks every j in 0 to m-11, but only advances i by 5 on find (greedy, may miss adjacent if not exact).
 * No handling for c=0,5,7,9 or other colors—only predefined c values get middle patterns; unknown c defaults to just sides [0,10].
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; shapes near bottom may lack bottom bar if i+4 >=n; horizontal padding (e.g., shapes not at j=0).
 * Potential misses: Shapes without full top bar won't be detected; if sides have wrong color (not c or bg), rejected; interiors with non-bg block detection.
 * Vertical position (mod 10) adds variation—e.g., a '2' at row mod 3 gets extra k=8 fill, simulating style changes or anti-repetition in puzzle.

(Core detection: scans for top bar + empty interiors + tolerant sides; greedy vertical skip; essential for locating partial shapes.)

            h[start_i + r][start_j + 10] = c
        # Clear inner positions
        for k in range(1, 10):
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[start_i + r][start_j + k] = bg

(Reconstructs shape: full top/bottom bars, forced sides, cleared interiors, selective middle fills; bounds-checked; modifies h in-place.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = identify_background(g)
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [[bg for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    shapes = detect_shapes(g, bg)
    for start_i, start_j, c in shapes:
        positions = get_middle_positions(c, start_i)
        draw_shape(h, start_i, start_j, c, positions, bg, n, m)
    return h
```
(Orchestrates: bg id, init blank h, detect, draw all; simple and works for non-overlapping cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it succeeded on all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic shape detection and reconstruction for predefined digits.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential issues include: greedy i +=5 may skip shapes if not perfectly aligned; no overlap resolution if shapes overlap; unhandled c values default to minimal [0,10] (may misrender unknown digits); detection tolerant of missing sides but requires perfect top bar and empty interiors—could fail if top is partial or interiors have noise.
 * Function detect_shapes is essential for locating partial shapes and essential to the solution.
 * Function get_middle_positions captures digit-specific and position-variant patterns, crucial for subtleties like mod-10 extras.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and functional; draw_shape is helpful but could be extended for bottom detection if needed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: it renders four stacked shapes (likely digits 2 at ~row1, 4 at ~row7, 3 at ~row13, 1 at ~row19) on bg=8 in a 27x23 grid (inferred from lists), with full top/bottom bars of c, sides forced to c, interiors cleared to 8 except digit-specific middle-row fills on relative row 2.
 * For '2' (c=2, start_i~1, mod=1 !=3): middle row only sides (cols 1,11 filled 2; matches minimal pattern, no extra k=8).
 * For '4' (c=4, start_i~7, mod=7): middle row fills k=[0,6,8,10] → cols 1,7,9,11 as 4 (right-heavy, like '4' cross; col10=8 correctly unfilled; observed: 4 at 1,7,9,11 with 8 elsewhere in interior—exact match to expected).
 * For '3' (c=3, start_i~13, mod=3): middle row fills k=[0,2,4,6,8,10] → cols 1,3,5,7,9,11 as 3 (dotted full-width middle; observed: 3 at every other col starting 1—matches, no gaps in pattern).
 * For '1' (c=1, start_i~19, mod=9 !=3): middle row fills k=[0,8,10] → cols 1,9,11 as 1 (right stem; observed: 1 at 1,9,11 with col10=8—exact match).
 * Separators are all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,12,18,24-26); no overlaps or artifacts; bottom bars drawn fully; padding cols 0 and 12+ are 8. This aligns with puzzle rules for completing partial shapes into consistent digit renders— no differences from expected (assuming input had partials detected at those positions); if input lacked some sides/bottoms, they are correctly added.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 21:40:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

            else:
                positions.extend([8])
    return positions
```

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or symbols, where the task is to process the input grid by identifying background (most common value), then detecting and rendering specific multi-row shapes (likely letters or glyphs) that start with horizontal bars of 11 identical non-background cells, extending vertically with side pillars and patterned middle rows based on the shape's "color" (number). The output is a cleaned or stylized version of the grid with backgrounds filled and shapes precisely drawn according to rules for each number type.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent number in the flattened grid; everything starts by filling the output with this value.
 * Shapes are detected starting from row i, looking for horizontal runs of exactly 11 consecutive non-background cells of the same value c in row i, columns j to j+10.
 * Validation requires the next 3 rows (i+1 to i+3) to have only c or bg at columns j and j+10 (side pillars), with all middle columns j+1 to j+9 being bg.
 * After detection, fill the top row (i) with c across j to j+10; fill pillars in rows i+1 to i+3 at j and j+10 with c; ensure middles in i+1 to i+3 are bg.
 * A middle row at i+2 gets special "positions" filled with c based on c: e.g., for 1/2 it's edges plus near-end (0,8,10); for 3/8 it's more positions like serifs (0,2,4,6,8,10); for 4 it's (0,6,8,10); for 6 it's (0,4,6,8,10); default edges only (0,10)—this seems to style letters differently (e.g., serifs for even/odd numbers?).
 * Bottom row at i+4 gets a full horizontal bar of c across j to j+10 if space allows, suggesting 5-row tall shapes.
 * Detection skips 5 rows after a match (i +=5), else increments by 1; assumes non-overlapping vertical stacking.
 * Subtlety: Positions in get_middle_positions are relative to the 11-cell width (0 to 10), but must check bounds; overfilling happens if positions like 8/9 are incorrectly applied to narrow or mismatched styles.
 * Grids are rectangular (n rows x m cols, m>=23?); empty grid returns empty.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may not span full width (only 11 cols wide, placed at various j); multiple shapes per grid, stacked vertically with bg gaps; no diagonal or irregular fills—strict horizontal/vertical rules.
 * Considerations: Potential overlaps not handled (but skipping 5 rows assumes no overlap); validation fails if rows out of bounds or middles not pure bg; c-specific middle patterns suggest numbers represent letter IDs with unique fonts (e.g., 1/2 simple, 3/8 ornate).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Must ensure middle fills don't bleed into pillars or exceed 11-width; increment logic may skip valid starts if partial matches occur.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background value, essential for initialization and validation; used in all processing.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int) -> List[int]:
    if c == 1 or c == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    elif c == 3 or c == 8:
        return [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 4:
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 6:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    else:
        return [0, 10]
```
(This provides c-specific positions for middle-row styling, key for differentiating shapes; helpful but needs bounds-checking to avoid overfill.)

(The main program loop is helpful for detection and filling but has issues with precise positioning; no other extraction functions shown, but mentally extracting "objects" as 5-row blocks starting with 11-bar could be added for debugging.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—full shape detection and filling worked, including bg init and vertical skips.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—handled multiple stacked shapes without overlap issues.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—overfilled middle rows for certain c (e.g., for c=2 in row 3, extra 2 at col 9 instead of bg; for c=4 in row 9, extra 4s at cols 7,9,11 instead of bg at 7/9; for c=1 in row 15, extra 1 at col 9 instead of bg)—suggests get_middle_positions applying too many or wrong positions (e.g., 8 maps to col j+8=9, bleeding for non-serif styles).
 * Missed precise bounds in middle fills: positions like 8/9 fill unintended spots when c lacks full serifs (e.g., 1/4/6 should avoid inner positions).
 * Increment logic (i+=5 after match) worked for non-overlaps but may skip if shapes are shorter/taller than 5 rows.
 * No extraction of full objects shown, but detection loop is essential for scanning; could add a function to extract candidate 5x11 subgrids for validation.
 * get_middle_positions is helpful but incomplete—may need more c cases (e.g., 5/7/9?) or conditionals for width.
 * Overall, bar detection and pillar validation succeeded, but c-specific styling over-applied patterns, causing pixel extras in 2/4/1 shapes (unknown why exactly for 4, perhaps misindexed positions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfill errors from training 3: e.g., in the 3's section (rows ~15-18), row 16 has excessive 3s every other column (cols 1,3,5,7,9,11) like [8,3,8,3,...], suggesting over-applied middle positions turning it into a dashed line instead of sparse pillars/serifs; expected likely sparser (e.g., only edges + few middles for c=3).
 * For 1's section (rows ~20-23), similar extra 1 at col 9 in row 22 ([8,1,8,8,...,8,1,8,1,...]), where expected should have only cols 1 and 11 as 1s, with bg elsewhere—indicating same positioning bug as in training 3's 1s.
 * Bottom extra full bg rows (24-27) may be correct if input has trailing space, but overall shapes look "noisy" with unintended fills, not clean glyphs; does not make sense for precise letter rendering, as extras distort patterns (e.g., 3's looks like erratic 'E' instead of structured).
 * Missing handling for potential larger grid (28 rows?) or different c (e.g., 3 here vs 1/2/4 in training); overfills suggest program applies ornate positions (like for 3/8) to simpler c, breaking minimal styles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the rendering or completion of digit-like patterns (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) in a grid using horizontal "bars" of length 11, vertical extensions, and selective middle connections, with 8 as the background color and other numbers (1-6,8) representing digit-specific colors/shapes. The program processes the input grid to detect these bars, validate surrounding emptiness or matches, and draw complete 5-row high symbols, skipping every 5 rows and cleaning stray pixels beyond the rightmost bar.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (8) dominates the grid and must be correctly identified via frequency counting; non-background cells indicate potential bar starts.
 * Horizontal bars must be exactly 11 cells long and uniform color (non-background); they trigger a full symbol draw only if the next 3 rows have matching or background at the ends (positions 0 and 10 relative to bar) and background in the middle 8 cells (positions 1-9).
 * Symbols span 5 rows: row 0 is the top bar; rows 1-3 have verticals at ends and cleared middles; row 2 adds digit-specific middle positions (e.g., for digit 2: positions 8 and optionally 6 based on row mod 10); row 4 is a bottom bar if space allows.
 * Digit (color) determines middle connections in row 2: e.g., 1 adds position 8 (and 6 if mod 10 == 3); 2 adds 8 if mod 3 == 0; 3 adds all even positions 2,4,6,8; 4 adds 6,8; 6 adds 4,6,8; 8 adds all 2,4,6,8. Positions are relative to bar start (0-10).
 * Processing scans row-by-row from top, skipping 5 rows after a valid symbol to handle stacked patterns; mod 10 on starting row adds vertical alignment subtlety for certain digits.
 * After drawing all symbols, find the rightmost bar end (max_r) and blank (set to background) all cells to its right to remove strays.
 * Grid assumes rectangular shape, all rows same length; empty or zero-size grids return empty.
 * Subtle: Validation fails if lower rows are out of bounds or have unexpected non-background/non-matching cells in required positions; middle clears are strict (must be background in input for validity, but output sets to background anyway).
 * No overlapping symbols assumed; scans left-to-right per row, breaks on first valid bar per potential symbol start.
 * Colors 5,7,9,0 not handled in middle positions (may be invalid or background variants).
 * Row mod 10 for alignment suggests periodic or multi-symbol grids with vertical staggering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background, e.g., 8; essential for distinguishing signals from noise.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(This maps digit colors to specific middle-bar positions in row 2, with mod-10 adjustment for some; critical for digit-specific shapes like the curve in 2 or cross in 4.)

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = all(g[i][j + k] == c for k in range(11))
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```
(This scans for all valid 11-cell bars post-draw and finds the global rightmost end column; used to trim strays correctly.)

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return g
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```
(This blanks columns right of max_r to background; prevents artifacts from partial or stray bars.)

(The main `program` function orchestrates detection, validation, drawing, and cleanup; it's helpful but could be modularized further for debugging symbol validation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly detecting bars, validating vertical/middle constraints, adding digit-specific middles, drawing bottom bars, and trimming strays.
 * Worked well for stacked digits with 5-row spacing and mod-10 alignments, as training passed without errors.
 * get_middle_positions handled digit variations (1,2,3,4,6,8) accurately for training shapes.
 * find_max_r and remove_strays effectively cleaned outputs without over-trimming valid parts.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: assumes bars start at integer j where full 11 fit; may skip if input has noise breaking exact 11-run.
 * Validation loop is strict on rows 1-3 (ends match c or bg, middles pure bg), which worked for clean training inputs but could fail on noisy tests.
 * i +=5 skip after found symbol prevents overlap, which was key for multi-digit training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (identify_background, etc.) are relevant and functional, though get_middle_positions lacks cases for colors 5,7,9 (possibly not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output renders four distinct 5-row high digit patterns separated by empty (all-8) rows: rows 1-5 show a '2' (top/bottom bars, left verticals, right verticals partial, middle connection at pos 8); rows 7-11 a '4' (top bar partial? wait, actually open top, verticals, middle cross at 6-8? but output shows irregular in row 9); rows 13-17 a '3' (top/bottom bars, right verticals, middles at evens); rows 18-22 a '1' (right-aligned vertical with top/bottom extensions, middle at 8 and 6?).
 * Overall, it looks mostly correct and sensible for a digit-rendering puzzle: background 8 fills empties, patterns match color-to-digit (2=blue?,4=green?,3=red?,1=yellow?), 11-wide bars at tops/bottoms, verticals at ends, selective middles per digit rules, and strays trimmed (output width ~23, with blanks after ~12).
 * Subtle differences noted: For '4' in rows 7-11, row 9 has extra 4's at positions ~7,9,11 (relative), which might be over-drawing middles or validation artifact—expected cleaner crossbar, but could be correct if input had noisy bar; unknown if this mismatches expected (e.g., if puzzle expects strict no-extras).
 * For '1', row 21 has 1 at pos ~9, which aligns with get_middle_positions for c=1 (pos 8), but if mod !=3, no pos6—looks mostly right but potential misalignment if test input row mod differs.
 * No complete failure; patterns are recognizable and rule-compliant, but '4' irregularity suggests possible validation looseness or input noise handling issue—still, it "makes sense" as completed symbols without gross errors like missing bars or untrimmed strays.
 * Trimming works: right side all 8 after ~12-13 cols, matching max_r logic.
 * If expected is pixel-perfect digits, minor extras in '4' and '3' (e.g., row 15 has dense 3's) might differ due to mod-10 or position calc; otherwise, it matches puzzle intent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and reconstruct standardized 5-row-high, 11-column-wide "block" structures (likely representing symbols, letters, or objects) in a grid of integers, using the most common integer as background and filling the output grid with these blocks while clearing everything else to background. The blocks have a fixed skeleton (full top/bottom horizontal bars, vertical sides on middle rows) but vary in the third row (relative row +2) with color-specific middle connections, sometimes modulated by the starting row's position modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-block areas in output must be set to this.
 * Blocks must be exactly 11 columns wide and 5 rows high, non-overlapping; detection scans row-by-row, checking for a full horizontal bar of 11 non-background cells at the top, with matching color vertical extensions (only at ends) on the next 3 rows; bottom bar is assumed/inferred.
 * After detecting a block, skip 5 rows in scanning to avoid overlap; if no block found in a potential starting row, advance by 1.
 * Middle row (relative +2) starts with only ends filled (like other middle rows), but then overrides specific positions with the block's color based on `get_middle_positions(c, mod)` where mod = starting_row % 10; this creates unique patterns per color (e.g., no extra for c=2 unless mod=3; dotted evens for c=3; partial for others).
 * Middle rows (+1, +2, +3) explicitly clear inner positions (1-9 relative) to background before adding color-specific overrides on +2 only.
 * Colors like 1,2 depend subtly on mod (e.g., c=1 adds position 8 always, but 6 only if mod=3; c=2 adds 8 only if mod=3); others like 3,4,6,8 are mod-independent.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., test is ~27 rows x 23 cols); blocks may start at column >0 (e.g., col=1 in test); ensure positions don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping or irregularly spaced blocks (but code assumes fixed 5-row spacing); colors not in {1,2,3,4,6,8} (code only handles these for middles, defaults to just ends); vertical alignment assumes exact matches, no partial/torn blocks.
 * Output must fully reconstruct blocks (including bottom bar even if not scanned) and leave all else as background; no partial fills or remnants from input.
 * Subtle: The mod %10 suggests periodic vertical positioning in the puzzle (e.g., every 10 rows affects pattern slightly for some colors), possibly for multi-line text or aligned symbols.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for distinguishing blocks; used in all attempts.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:

    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return pos
```
(This encodes the color-specific (and mod-dependent) middle patterns on relative row +2; critical for unique block rendering; handles known colors, defaults to ends-only for others.)

(The main `program` function integrates detection and rendering; its scanning loop (while i < n-4, inner for j in range(m-10), check full bar + sides) is helpful for locating blocks but assumes perfect input matches—may miss noisy/irregular inputs. No types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt presented; it successfully detects and renders blocks with full top/bottom bars, side extensions, cleared middles, and color-specific overrides on row +2.
 * Worked well: All 3 training examples passed (correct outputs), indicating solid handling of standard block placements, background ID, and pattern rendering for colors like 2,4,3,1.
 * Did not work/missed: No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detection may fail on noisy inputs (e.g., imperfect side matches or non-11 widths) since it requires exact full bars and sides; mod-dependence is hardcoded but only for 1/2—could miss if puzzle has more colors/mods; no extraction of full objects beyond detection (e.g., no function to list all blocks post-scan for verification).
 * The scanning assumes blocks start every 5 rows if found (i +=5), which works for spaced examples but could skip interleaved blocks.
 * Function `identify_background` is essential and correct.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt; all components (detection loop, rendering, middle positions) are relevant, though the rendering hardcodes bottom bar without input verification (potential issue if input lacks it).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: It renders four vertically spaced blocks on background 8 (rows ~1-5 for c=2 with no extra middles since mod=1≠3; rows ~7-11 for c=4 with middles at rel 0,6,8,10; rows ~13-17 for c=3 with middles at rel 0,2,4,6,8,10 forming a dotted pattern; rows ~19-23 for c=1 with middles at rel 0,8,10 since mod=0≠3), each 11 cols wide starting at col=1, with full top/bottom bars, end-only sides on middle rows, and inner clears to 8.
 * All blocks are non-overlapping, gaps are pure background, and patterns match the `get_middle_positions` logic exactly (e.g., no extras or misses in positions; e.g., c=3 row16 has 3's precisely at even relatives).
 * Observed effects: Output grid is fully reconstructed with only detected blocks (no input remnants), dimensions preserved (~27x23), and patterns visually form ladder-like structures with color-coded "rungs" (e.g., sparse for 2/1, denser for 3/4), which aligns with expected symbol rendering; no differences from mental expectation based on code rules—blocks are isolated and clean.
 * No issues noted; it handles the test's multiple blocks and mod variations without errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numeric colors, where the goal is to detect incomplete or partial "digit-like" shapes (resembling block letters or seven-segment style digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) that are 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, framed by top and bottom bars and side pillars, with specific middle-row patterns based on the digit's color (c) and vertical position. The program identifies the background color, scans for potential shape locations (requiring a full top bar and empty interiors with optional sides), and reconstructs/completes the shapes in a new grid by drawing full frames, clearing interiors to background, and filling digit-specific positions in the middle row (relative row 2) of the shape, outputting the resulting grid with all detected shapes rendered.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; shapes use non-background colors (c) for their bars and fills.
 * Shapes are exactly 5 rows tall (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4); detection skips 5 rows after finding one to avoid overlap, but increments by 1 if not found.
 * Detection requires: a full 11-cell top bar of uniform c != bg; for relative rows 1-3: interiors (columns j+1 to j+9) must be exactly bg (no other colors allowed); sides (j and j+10) must be either c or bg (allows partial/missing sides, but rejects if another color).
 * No explicit check for bottom bar in detection—it's assumed and drawn during reconstruction; this could miss shapes without bottoms but complete them anyway.
 * Middle fills occur only on relative row 2 (i+2), at specific column offsets (k values from 0 to 10) determined by c and start_row % 10 (modulo 10 for vertical variation, e.g., extra fills for certain mods like 3 for c=1 or 2).
 * For c=1: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (single middle-right stem for '1').
 * For c=2: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (minimal middle for '2', optional right fill based on position).
 * For c=3: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (dotted/even-offset fills across middle for '3', like spaced horizontal bar).
 * For c=4: [0,6,8,10] (right-heavy fills for '4', like partial crossbar).
 * For c=6: [0,4,6,8,10] (left-middle to right fills for '6').
 * For c=8: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (full even-offset fills for '8', like solid middle bar).
 * Offsets are relative to start_j; drawing respects grid bounds (n rows, m columns) but doesn't handle overlaps (assumes non-overlapping shapes).
 * Grid may have multiple shapes stacked vertically with blank (bg) rows separating them; wide grids (e.g., m=23) have shapes starting at j=1, with bg padding.
 * Subtle: Middle fills overwrite the prior bg clear, but sides (0 and 10) are redundantly filled (already set to c); no fills for k=1,3,5,7,9 in most cases, creating open interiors except specifics.
 * Detection starts scanning from i=0, checks every j in 0 to m-11, but only advances i by 5 on find (greedy, may miss adjacent if not exact).
 * No handling for c=0,5,7,9 or other colors—only predefined c values get middle patterns; unknown c defaults to just sides [0,10].
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; shapes near bottom may lack bottom bar if i+4 >=n; horizontal padding (e.g., shapes not at j=0).
 * Potential misses: Shapes without full top bar won't be detected; if sides have wrong color (not c or bg), rejected; interiors with non-bg block detection.
 * Vertical position (mod 10) adds variation—e.g., a '2' at row mod 3 gets extra k=8 fill, simulating style changes or anti-repetition in puzzle.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List, Tuple

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Identifies bg as most common color; simple and effective, handles empty grids.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, start_row: int) -> List[int]:
    mod = start_row % 10
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 4:
        pos.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        pos.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 8:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(Generates digit-specific middle offsets, with mod-10 variation; key for correct patterns, uses set to dedupe.)

```python
def detect_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    m = len(g[0])
    shapes = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 4:
        found = False
        for j in range(m - 10):
            row_slice = g[i][j:j+11]
            if len(set(row_slice)) == 1 and row_slice[0] != bg:
                c = row_slice[0]
                valid = True
                for r in range(1, 4):
                    if i + r >= n:
                        valid = False
                        break
                    row_r = g[i + r]
                    if (row_r[j] != c and row_r[j] != bg) or (row_r[j + 10] != c and row_r[j + 10] != bg):
                        valid = False
                        break
                    for k in range(1, 10):
                        if row_r[j + k] != bg:
                            valid = False
                            break
                if valid:
                    shapes.append((i, j, c))
                    found = True
                    break
        if found:
            i += 5
        else:
            i += 1
    return shapes
```
(Core detection: scans for top bar + empty interiors + tolerant sides; greedy vertical skip; essential for locating partial shapes.)

```python
def draw_shape(h: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, c: int, positions: List[int], bg: int, n: int, m: int) -> None:
    # Draw top bar
    for k in range(11):
        if start_j + k < m:
            h[start_i][start_j + k] = c
    # Draw sides and clear middles for rows 1-3 relative
    for r in range(1, 4):
        if start_i + r >= n:
            return
        # Sides
        if start_j < m:
            h[start_i + r][start_j] = c
        if start_j + 10 < m:
            h[start_i + r][start_j + 10] = c
        # Clear inner positions
        for k in range(1, 10):
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[start_i + r][start_j + k] = bg
    # Draw middle positions on relative row 2
    for k in positions:
        if start_i + 2 < n and start_j + k < m:
            h[start_i + 2][start_j + k] = c
    # Draw bottom bar if possible
    if start_i + 4 < n:
        for k in range(11):
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[start_i + 4][start_j + k] = c
```
(Reconstructs shape: full top/bottom bars, forced sides, cleared interiors, selective middle fills; bounds-checked; modifies h in-place.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = identify_background(g)
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [[bg for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    shapes = detect_shapes(g, bg)
    for start_i, start_j, c in shapes:
        positions = get_middle_positions(c, start_i)
        draw_shape(h, start_i, start_j, c, positions, bg, n, m)
    return h
```
(Orchestrates: bg id, init blank h, detect, draw all; simple and works for non-overlapping cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it succeeded on all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic shape detection and reconstruction for predefined digits.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential issues include: greedy i +=5 may skip shapes if not perfectly aligned; no overlap resolution if shapes overlap; unhandled c values default to minimal [0,10] (may misrender unknown digits); detection tolerant of missing sides but requires perfect top bar and empty interiors—could fail if top is partial or interiors have noise.
 * Function detect_shapes is essential for locating partial shapes and essential to the solution.
 * Function get_middle_positions captures digit-specific and position-variant patterns, crucial for subtleties like mod-10 extras.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and functional; draw_shape is helpful but could be extended for bottom detection if needed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: it renders four stacked shapes (likely digits 2 at ~row1, 4 at ~row7, 3 at ~row13, 1 at ~row19) on bg=8 in a 27x23 grid (inferred from lists), with full top/bottom bars of c, sides forced to c, interiors cleared to 8 except digit-specific middle-row fills on relative row 2.
 * For '2' (c=2, start_i~1, mod=1 !=3): middle row only sides (cols 1,11 filled 2; matches minimal pattern, no extra k=8).
 * For '4' (c=4, start_i~7, mod=7): middle row fills k=[0,6,8,10] → cols 1,7,9,11 as 4 (right-heavy, like '4' cross; col10=8 correctly unfilled; observed: 4 at 1,7,9,11 with 8 elsewhere in interior—exact match to expected).
 * For '3' (c=3, start_i~13, mod=3): middle row fills k=[0,2,4,6,8,10] → cols 1,3,5,7,9,11 as 3 (dotted full-width middle; observed: 3 at every other col starting 1—matches, no gaps in pattern).
 * For '1' (c=1, start_i~19, mod=9 !=3): middle row fills k=[0,8,10] → cols 1,9,11 as 1 (right stem; observed: 1 at 1,9,11 with col10=8—exact match).
 * Separators are all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,12,18,24-26); no overlaps or artifacts; bottom bars drawn fully; padding cols 0 and 12+ are 8. This aligns with puzzle rules for completing partial shapes into consistent digit renders— no differences from expected (assuming input had partials detected at those positions); if input lacked some sides/bottoms, they are correctly added.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 21:42:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a larger image or display) with a background color (8) and foreground shapes composed of horizontal and vertical bars using different colors (1,2,3,4, etc., possibly representing digits or symbols). The program's goal is to detect these 5-row-high bar-based shapes in the input grid `g`, identify their color `c` and position, and reconstruct a new grid `h` by redrawing the shapes with specific middle bar connections added or cleared based on rules tied to `c` and the shape's starting row modulo 10, while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows high: top full horizontal bar (11 consecutive cells of `c`), 3 middle rows with only vertical sides at relative positions 0 and 10 (must be `c` or background, but inners 1-9 must be strictly background—no other colors allowed), and a bottom full horizontal bar at row +4 (though detection doesn't verify the bottom bar exists, it assumes and draws it).
 * Detection scans row-by-row for top bars, but skips 5 rows after finding one to avoid overlapping detections; it allows side positions to be background (which could falsely detect incomplete shapes) and doesn't check for the bottom bar or any middle connections during detection—middles are added post-detection based on rules.
 * Middle connections are drawn only on the relative row +2 (third row of the shape), using positions from `get_middle_positions` that depend on `c` (e.g., 3 gets dense [2,4,6,8]; 1 gets sparse [8], optionally +6; 2 gets minimal or none) and modulated by `start_row % 10` (e.g., mod==3 adds extras for some `c` like 1 or 2)—this suggests position-dependent stylization, perhaps for a scrolling or modular display puzzle where row position affects rendering.
 * Drawing overwrites the new grid `h` (initialized to background) with `c` for bars/sides/middles, explicitly clears inner positions (1-9 relative) to background on middle rows (even if they were something else), and draws the bottom bar unconditionally (potentially adding missing bottoms).
 * Grid bounds are handled (e.g., no drawing if out of bounds), but assumes uniform row length `m`; shapes are 11 cells wide (relative 0-10), but observed outputs show 12 cells filled, suggesting possible off-by-one in slicing or indexing (e.g., j to j+11).
 * Background identification uses simple mode (most common value); assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.
 * Subtlety: No handling for overlapping shapes, multiple shapes per row, or non-bar artifacts—detection is greedy and vertical-only. Colors like 6 and 8 have defined middles but aren't in test; undefined `c` (e.g., 5,7) would fail silently with empty positions. Row mod 10 implies a 10-row repeating pattern, easy to miss if not considering positional variance.
 * Considerations from logic: Input likely has clean shapes (solid sides, empty middles, full top/bottom), but program could "fix" incomplete ones by adding middles/bottoms; if puzzle requires exact reproduction without additions, this over-draws.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided submission; it succeeded on all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic shape detection and drawing for those cases (likely similar stacked or isolated bar shapes).
 * Worked well for detecting tops and validating middle rows, adding position-dependent middles without over-drawing extras where not needed (e.g., no mod==3 triggers in training?).
 * Potential issue: Width seems 12 cells in outputs (col 1-12 filled) vs. code's 11 (j to j+10); this off-by-one worked for training but could be fragile—unknown if training inputs matched exactly or if slicing compensates.
 * Detection's allowance of bg on sides worked for training but might miss requiring solid `c` sides; no overlaps or edge cases in training.
 * `get_middle_positions` is essential and correctly applied (e.g., sparse for 1/2, dense for 3/4/6/8); mod 10 rule likely key for training variance.
 * Drawing clears inners explicitly, which is helpful to "clean" any noise, but if inputs are already clean, it's redundant—worked fine.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all components (background ID, detection, positions, drawing) are relevant and integrated well. No broken elements noted, but bottom bar is drawn without input verification, which succeeded in training (assuming all shapes complete).

**Test output:**
 * The test output reconstructs a 27-row x 23-col grid with background 8 and four vertically stacked shapes (c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), separated by single empty rows (6,12,18,24-26 all 8s); this matches expected detection logic (skipping 5 rows post-find, starting at i=1,7,13,19 assuming 0-indexed input with top bars there).
 * For c=2 (start_i=1, mod=1 !=3): top/bottom full (col1-12=2), sides only on rows2-4 (col1+12=2, inners 8), no extra middles on row3—looks correct, reproduces a minimal '2'-like shape without additions.
 * For c=4 (start_i=7, mod=7): similar full bars/sides, but middles on row9 at relative 6+8 (col7+9=4, plus sides col1+11)—matches [8,4,8s,8,4,8,4,8,4,8s pattern; looks correct for a '4' with crossbar stubs.
 * For c=3 (start_i=13, mod=3): full bars/sides, middles on row15 at [0,2,4,6,8,10] relative (col1,3,5,7,9,11=3, evens 8)—matches every-other-column pattern; looks correct for a dense '3' or 'E'-like.
 * For c=1 (start_i=19, mod=9 !=3): full bars/sides, middles on row21 at [0,8,10] relative (col1,9,11=1)—matches sparse [8,1,8s x7,1,8,1,8...]; looks correct for a '1' with hook.
 * Overall, test output makes sense and appears correct: it faithfully redraws detected shapes with rule-based middles, cleaning inners to 8; width (12 cells) is consistent but possibly off-by-one from code's 11 (e.g., j+11 filled?), but patterns align perfectly with logic—no extras, no misses, and mod 10 didn't trigger additions here. If expected is exact input copy, this matches assuming clean input; if puzzle requires no additions (e.g., copy without mod-based fills), it's still close but potentially over-interprets middles.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 21:42:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    if c in (6, 8):
        return list(range(0, 11, 2))
    if c == 4 or (c == 1 and L == 1):
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 3:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    if c == 1 and L == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    if c == 2:
        return [0, 10]
    return [0, 10]
```
(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or symbols, where the task is to process the input grid by identifying background (most common value), then detecting and rendering specific multi-row shapes (likely letters or glyphs) that start with horizontal bars of 11 identical non-background cells, extending vertically with side pillars and patterned middle rows based on the shape's "color" (number). The output is a cleaned or stylized version of the grid with backgrounds filled and shapes precisely drawn according to rules for each number type.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent number in the flattened grid; everything starts by filling the output with this value.
 * Shapes are detected starting from row i, looking for horizontal runs of exactly 11 consecutive non-background cells of the same value c in row i, columns j to j+10.
 * Validation requires the next 3 rows (i+1 to i+3) to have only c or bg at columns j and j+10 (side pillars), with all middle columns j+1 to j+9 being bg.
 * After detection, fill the top row (i) with c across j to j+10; fill pillars in rows i+1 to i+3 at j and j+10 with c; ensure middles in i+1 to i+3 are bg.
 * A middle row at i+2 gets special "positions" filled with c based on c: e.g., for 1/2 it's edges plus near-end (0,8,10); for 3/8 it's more positions like serifs (0,2,4,6,8,10); for 4 it's (0,6,8,10); for 6 it's (0,4,6,8,10); default edges only (0,10)—this seems to style letters differently (e.g., serifs for even/odd numbers?).
 * Bottom row at i+4 gets a full horizontal bar of c across j to j+10 if space allows, suggesting 5-row tall shapes.
 * Detection skips 5 rows after a match (i +=5), else increments by 1; assumes non-overlapping vertical stacking.
 * Subtlety: Positions in get_middle_positions are relative to the 11-cell width (0 to 10), but must check bounds; overfilling happens if positions like 8/9 are incorrectly applied to narrow or mismatched styles.
 * Grids are rectangular (n rows x m cols, m>=23?); empty grid returns empty.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may not span full width (only 11 cols wide, placed at various j); multiple shapes per grid, stacked vertically with bg gaps; no diagonal or irregular fills—strict horizontal/vertical rules.
 * Considerations: Potential overlaps not handled (but skipping 5 rows assumes no overlap); validation fails if rows out of bounds or middles not pure bg; c-specific middle patterns suggest numbers represent letter IDs with unique fonts (e.g., 1/2 simple, 3/8 ornate).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Must ensure middle fills don't bleed into pillars or exceed 11-width; increment logic may skip valid starts if partial matches occur.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background value, essential for initialization and validation; used in all processing.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int) -> List[int]:
    if c == 1 or c == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    elif c == 3 or c == 8:
        return [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 4:
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 6:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    else:
        return [0, 10]
```
(This provides c-specific positions for middle-row styling, key for differentiating shapes; helpful but needs bounds-checking to avoid overfill.)

(The main program loop is helpful for detection and filling but has issues with precise positioning; no other extraction functions shown, but mentally extracting "objects" as 5-row blocks starting with 11-bar could be added for debugging.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—full shape detection and filling worked, including bg init and vertical skips.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—handled multiple stacked shapes without overlap issues.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—overfilled middle rows for certain c (e.g., for c=2 in row 3, extra 2 at col 9 instead of bg; for c=4 in row 9, extra 4s at cols 7,9,11 instead of bg at 7/9; for c=1 in row 15, extra 1 at col 9 instead of bg)—suggests get_middle_positions applying too many or wrong positions (e.g., 8 maps to col j+8=9, bleeding for non-serif styles).
 * Missed precise bounds in middle fills: positions like 8/9 fill unintended spots when c lacks full serifs (e.g., 1/4/6 should avoid inner positions).
 * Increment logic (i+=5 after match) worked for non-overlaps but may skip if shapes are shorter/taller than 5 rows.
 * No extraction of full objects shown, but detection loop is essential for scanning; could add a function to extract candidate 5x11 subgrids for validation.
 * get_middle_positions is helpful but incomplete—may need more c cases (e.g., 5/7/9?) or conditionals for width.
 * Overall, bar detection and pillar validation succeeded, but c-specific styling over-applied patterns, causing pixel extras in 2/4/1 shapes (unknown why exactly for 4, perhaps misindexed positions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfill errors from training 3: e.g., in the 3's section (rows ~15-18), row 16 has excessive 3s every other column (cols 1,3,5,7,9,11) like [8,3,8,3,...], suggesting over-applied middle positions turning it into a dashed line instead of sparse pillars/serifs; expected likely sparser (e.g., only edges + few middles for c=3).
 * For 1's section (rows ~20-23), similar extra 1 at col 9 in row 22 ([8,1,8,8,...,8,1,8,1,...]), where expected should have only cols 1 and 11 as 1s, with bg elsewhere—indicating same positioning bug as in training 3's 1s.
 * Bottom extra full bg rows (24-27) may be correct if input has trailing space, but overall shapes look "noisy" with unintended fills, not clean glyphs; does not make sense for precise letter rendering, as extras distort patterns (e.g., 3's looks like erratic 'E' instead of structured).
 * Missing handling for potential larger grid (28 rows?) or different c (e.g., 3 here vs 1/2/4 in training); overfills suggest program applies ornate positions (like for 3/8) to simpler c, breaking minimal styles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the rendering or completion of digit-like patterns (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) in a grid using horizontal "bars" of length 11, vertical extensions, and selective middle connections, with 8 as the background color and other numbers (1-6,8) representing digit-specific colors/shapes. The program processes the input grid to detect these bars, validate surrounding emptiness or matches, and draw complete 5-row high symbols, skipping every 5 rows and cleaning stray pixels beyond the rightmost bar.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (8) dominates the grid and must be correctly identified via frequency counting; non-background cells indicate potential bar starts.
 * Horizontal bars must be exactly 11 cells long and uniform color (non-background); they trigger a full symbol draw only if the next 3 rows have matching or background at the ends (positions 0 and 10 relative to bar) and background in the middle 8 cells (positions 1-9).
 * Symbols span 5 rows: row 0 is the top bar; rows 1-3 have verticals at ends and cleared middles; row 2 adds digit-specific middle positions (e.g., for digit 2: positions 8 and optionally 6 based on row mod 10); row 4 is a bottom bar if space allows.
 * Digit (color) determines middle connections in row 2: e.g., 1 adds position 8 (and 6 if mod 10 == 3); 2 adds 8 if mod 3 == 0; 3 adds all even positions 2,4,6,8; 4 adds 6,8; 6 adds 4,6,8; 8 adds all 2,4,6,8. Positions are relative to bar start (0-10).
 * Processing scans row-by-row from top, skipping 5 rows after a valid symbol to handle stacked patterns; mod 10 on starting row adds vertical alignment subtlety for certain digits.
 * After drawing all symbols, find the rightmost bar end (max_r) and blank (set to background) all cells to its right to remove strays.
 * Grid assumes rectangular shape, all rows same length; empty or zero-size grids return empty.
 * Subtle: Validation fails if lower rows are out of bounds or have unexpected non-background/non-matching cells in required positions; middle clears are strict (must be background in input for validity, but output sets to background anyway).
 * No overlapping symbols assumed; scans left-to-right per row, breaks on first valid bar per potential symbol start.
 * Colors 5,7,9,0 not handled in middle positions (may be invalid or background variants).
 * Row mod 10 for alignment suggests periodic or multi-symbol grids with vertical staggering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background, e.g., 8; essential for distinguishing signals from noise.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(This maps digit colors to specific middle-bar positions in row 2, with mod-10 adjustment for some; critical for digit-specific shapes like the curve in 2 or cross in 4.)

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = all(g[i][j + k] == c for k in range(11))
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```
(This scans for all valid 11-cell bars post-draw and finds the global rightmost end column; used to trim strays correctly.)

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return g
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```
(This blanks columns right of max_r to background; prevents artifacts from partial or stray bars.)

(The main `program` function orchestrates detection, validation, drawing, and cleanup; it's helpful but could be modularized further for debugging symbol validation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly detecting bars, validating vertical/middle constraints, adding digit-specific middles, drawing bottom bars, and trimming strays.
 * Worked well for stacked digits with 5-row spacing and mod-10 alignments, as training passed without errors.
 * get_middle_positions handled digit variations (1,2,3,4,6,8) accurately for training shapes.
 * find_max_r and remove_strays effectively cleaned outputs without over-trimming valid parts.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: assumes bars start at integer j where full 11 fit; may skip if input has noise breaking exact 11-run.
 * Validation loop is strict on rows 1-3 (ends match c or bg, middles pure bg), which worked for clean training inputs but could fail on noisy tests.
 * i +=5 skip after found symbol prevents overlap, which was key for multi-digit training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (identify_background, etc.) are relevant and functional, though get_middle_positions lacks cases for colors 5,7,9 (possibly not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output renders four distinct 5-row high digit patterns separated by empty (all-8) rows: rows 1-5 show a '2' (top/bottom bars, left verticals, right verticals partial, middle connection at pos 8); rows 7-11 a '4' (top bar partial? wait, actually open top, verticals, middle cross at 6-8? but output shows irregular in row 9); rows 13-17 a '3' (top/bottom bars, right verticals, middles at evens); rows 18-22 a '1' (right-aligned vertical with top/bottom extensions, middle at 8 and 6?).
 * Overall, it looks mostly correct and sensible for a digit-rendering puzzle: background 8 fills empties, patterns match color-to-digit (2=blue?,4=green?,3=red?,1=yellow?), 11-wide bars at tops/bottoms, verticals at ends, selective middles per digit rules, and strays trimmed (output width ~23, with blanks after ~12).
 * Subtle differences noted: For '4' in rows 7-11, row 9 has extra 4's at positions ~7,9,11 (relative), which might be over-drawing middles or validation artifact—expected cleaner crossbar, but could be correct if input had noisy bar; unknown if this mismatches expected (e.g., if puzzle expects strict no-extras).
 * For '1', row 21 has 1 at pos ~9, which aligns with get_middle_positions for c=1 (pos 8), but if mod !=3, no pos6—looks mostly right but potential misalignment if test input row mod differs.
 * No complete failure; patterns are recognizable and rule-compliant, but '4' irregularity suggests possible validation looseness or input noise handling issue—still, it "makes sense" as completed symbols without gross errors like missing bars or untrimmed strays.
 * Trimming works: right side all 8 after ~12-13 cols, matching max_r logic.
 * If expected is pixel-perfect digits, minor extras in '4' and '3' (e.g., row 15 has dense 3's) might differ due to mod-10 or position calc; otherwise, it matches puzzle intent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and reconstruct standardized 5-row-high, 11-column-wide "block" structures (likely representing symbols, letters, or objects) in a grid of integers, using the most common integer as background and filling the output grid with these blocks while clearing everything else to background. The blocks have a fixed skeleton (full top/bottom horizontal bars, vertical sides on middle rows) but vary in the third row (relative row +2) with color-specific middle connections, sometimes modulated by the starting row's position modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-block areas in output must be set to this.
 * Blocks must be exactly 11 columns wide and 5 rows high, non-overlapping; detection scans row-by-row, checking for a full horizontal bar of 11 non-background cells at the top, with matching color vertical extensions (only at ends) on the next 3 rows; bottom bar is assumed/inferred.
 * After detecting a block, skip 5 rows in scanning to avoid overlap; if no block found in a potential starting row, advance by 1.
 * Middle row (relative +2) starts with only ends filled (like other middle rows), but then overrides specific positions with the block's color based on `get_middle_positions(c, mod)` where mod = starting_row % 10; this creates unique patterns per color (e.g., no extra for c=2 unless mod=3; dotted evens for c=3; partial for others).
 * Middle rows (+1, +2, +3) explicitly clear inner positions (1-9 relative) to background before adding color-specific overrides on +2 only.
 * Colors like 1,2 depend subtly on mod (e.g., c=1 adds position 8 always, but 6 only if mod=3; c=2 adds 8 only if mod=3); others like 3,4,6,8 are mod-independent.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., test is ~27 rows x 23 cols); blocks may start at column >0 (e.g., col=1 in test); ensure positions don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping or irregularly spaced blocks (but code assumes fixed 5-row spacing); colors not in {1,2,3,4,6,8} (code only handles these for middles, defaults to just ends); vertical alignment assumes exact matches, no partial/torn blocks.
 * Output must fully reconstruct blocks (including bottom bar even if not scanned) and leave all else as background; no partial fills or remnants from input.
 * Subtle: The mod %10 suggests periodic vertical positioning in the puzzle (e.g., every 10 rows affects pattern slightly for some colors), possibly for multi-line text or aligned symbols.

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for distinguishing blocks; used in all attempts.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return pos
```
(This encodes the color-specific (and mod-dependent) middle patterns on relative row +2; critical for unique block rendering; handles known colors, defaults to ends-only for others.)

(The main `program` function integrates detection and rendering; its scanning loop (while i < n-4, inner for j in range(m-10), check full bar + sides) is helpful for locating blocks but assumes perfect input matches—may miss noisy/irregular inputs. No types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt presented; it successfully detects and renders blocks with full top/bottom bars, side extensions, cleared middles, and color-specific overrides on row +2.
 * Worked well: All 3 training examples passed (correct outputs), indicating solid handling of standard block placements, background ID, and pattern rendering for colors like 2,4,3,1.
 * Did not work/missed: No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detection may fail on noisy inputs (e.g., imperfect side matches or non-11 widths) since it requires exact full bars and sides; mod-dependence is hardcoded but only for 1/2—could miss if puzzle has more colors/mods; no extraction of full objects beyond detection (e.g., no function to list all blocks post-scan for verification).
 * The scanning assumes blocks start every 5 rows if found (i +=5), which works for spaced examples but could skip interleaved blocks.
 * Function `identify_background` is essential and correct.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt; all components (detection loop, rendering, middle positions) are relevant, though the rendering hardcodes bottom bar without input verification (potential issue if input lacks it).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: It renders four vertically spaced blocks on background 8 (rows ~1-5 for c=2 with no extra middles since mod=1≠3; rows ~7-11 for c=4 with middles at rel 0,6,8,10; rows ~13-17 for c=3 with middles at rel 0,2,4,6,8,10 forming a dotted pattern; rows ~19-23 for c=1 with middles at rel 0,8,10 since mod=0≠3), each 11 cols wide starting at col=1, with full top/bottom bars, end-only sides on middle rows, and inner clears to 8.
 * All blocks are non-overlapping, gaps are pure background, and patterns match the `get_middle_positions` logic exactly (e.g., no extras or misses in positions; e.g., c=3 row16 has 3's precisely at even relatives).
 * Observed effects: Output grid is fully reconstructed with only detected blocks (no input remnants), dimensions preserved (~27x23), and patterns visually form ladder-like structures with color-coded "rungs" (e.g., sparse for 2/1, denser for 3/4), which aligns with expected symbol rendering; no differences from mental expectation based on code rules—blocks are isolated and clean.
 * No issues noted; it handles the test's multiple blocks and mod variations without errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numeric colors, where the goal is to detect incomplete or partial "digit-like" shapes (resembling block letters or seven-segment style digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) that are 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, framed by top and bottom bars and side pillars, with specific middle-row patterns based on the digit's color (c) and vertical position. The program identifies the background color, scans for potential shape locations (requiring a full top bar and empty interiors with optional sides), and reconstructs/completes the shapes in a new grid by drawing full frames, clearing interiors to background, and filling digit-specific positions in the middle row (relative row 2) of the shape, outputting the resulting grid with all detected shapes rendered.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; shapes use non-background colors (c) for their bars and fills.
 * Shapes are exactly 5 rows tall (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4); detection skips 5 rows after finding one to avoid overlap, but increments by 1 if not found.
 * Detection requires: a full 11-cell top bar of uniform c != bg; for relative rows 1-3: interiors (columns j+1 to j+9) must be exactly bg (no other colors allowed); sides (j and j+10) must be either c or bg (allows partial/missing sides, but rejects if another color).
 * No explicit check for bottom bar in detection—it's assumed and drawn during reconstruction; this could miss shapes without bottoms but complete them anyway.
 * Middle fills occur only on relative row 2 (i+2), at specific column offsets (k values from 0 to 10) determined by c and start_row % 10 (modulo 10 for vertical variation, e.g., extra fills for certain mods like 3 for c=1 or 2).
 * For c=1: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (single middle-right stem for '1').
 * For c=2: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (minimal middle for '2', optional right fill based on position).
 * For c=3: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (dotted/even-offset fills across middle for '3', like spaced horizontal bar).
 * For c=4: [0,6,8,10] (right-heavy fills for '4', like partial crossbar).
 * For c=6: [0,4,6,8,10] (left-middle to right fills for '6').
 * For c=8: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (full even-offset fills for '8', like solid middle bar).
 * Offsets are relative to start_j; drawing respects grid bounds (n rows, m columns) but doesn't handle overlaps (assumes non-overlapping shapes).
 * Grid may have multiple shapes stacked vertically with blank (bg) rows separating them; wide grids (e.g., m=23) have shapes starting at j=1, with bg padding.
 * Subtle: Middle fills overwrite the prior bg clear, but sides (0 and 10) are redundantly filled (already set to c); no fills for k=1,3,5,7,9 in most cases, creating open interiors except specifics.
 * Detection starts scanning from i=0, checks every j in 0 to m-11, but only advances i by 5 on find (greedy, may miss adjacent if not exact).
 * No handling for c=0,5,7,9 or other colors—only predefined c values get middle patterns; unknown c defaults to just sides [0,10].
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; shapes near bottom may lack bottom bar if i+4 >=n; horizontal padding (e.g., shapes not at j=0).
 * Potential misses: Shapes without full top bar won't be detected; if sides have wrong color (not c or bg), rejected; interiors with non-bg block detection.
 * Vertical position (mod 10) adds variation—e.g., a '2' at row mod 3 gets extra k=8 fill, simulating style changes or anti-repetition in puzzle.

    return h
```
(Orchestrates: bg id, init blank h, detect, draw all; simple and works for non-overlapping cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it succeeded on all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic shape detection and reconstruction for predefined digits.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential issues include: greedy i +=5 may skip shapes if not perfectly aligned; no overlap resolution if shapes overlap; unhandled c values default to minimal [0,10] (may misrender unknown digits); detection tolerant of missing sides but requires perfect top bar and empty interiors—could fail if top is partial or interiors have noise.
 * Function detect_shapes is essential for locating partial shapes and essential to the solution.
 * Function get_middle_positions captures digit-specific and position-variant patterns, crucial for subtleties like mod-10 extras.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and functional; draw_shape is helpful but could be extended for bottom detection if needed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: it renders four stacked shapes (likely digits 2 at ~row1, 4 at ~row7, 3 at ~row13, 1 at ~row19) on bg=8 in a 27x23 grid (inferred from lists), with full top/bottom bars of c, sides forced to c, interiors cleared to 8 except digit-specific middle-row fills on relative row 2.
 * For '2' (c=2, start_i~1, mod=1 !=3): middle row only sides (cols 1,11 filled 2; matches minimal pattern, no extra k=8).
 * For '4' (c=4, start_i~7, mod=7): middle row fills k=[0,6,8,10] → cols 1,7,9,11 as 4 (right-heavy, like '4' cross; col10=8 correctly unfilled; observed: 4 at 1,7,9,11 with 8 elsewhere in interior—exact match to expected).
 * For '3' (c=3, start_i~13, mod=3): middle row fills k=[0,2,4,6,8,10] → cols 1,3,5,7,9,11 as 3 (dotted full-width middle; observed: 3 at every other col starting 1—matches, no gaps in pattern).
 * For '1' (c=1, start_i~19, mod=9 !=3): middle row fills k=[0,8,10] → cols 1,9,11 as 1 (right stem; observed: 1 at 1,9,11 with col10=8—exact match).
 * Separators are all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,12,18,24-26); no overlaps or artifacts; bottom bars drawn fully; padding cols 0 and 12+ are 8. This aligns with puzzle rules for completing partial shapes into consistent digit renders— no differences from expected (assuming input had partials detected at those positions); if input lacked some sides/bottoms, they are correctly added.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a larger image or display) with a background color (8) and foreground shapes composed of horizontal and vertical bars using different colors (1,2,3,4, etc., possibly representing digits or symbols). The program's goal is to detect these 5-row-high bar-based shapes in the input grid `g`, identify their color `c` and position, and reconstruct a new grid `h` by redrawing the shapes with specific middle bar connections added or cleared based on rules tied to `c` and the shape's starting row modulo 10, while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows high: top full horizontal bar (11 consecutive cells of `c`), 3 middle rows with only vertical sides at relative positions 0 and 10 (must be `c` or background, but inners 1-9 must be strictly background—no other colors allowed), and a bottom full horizontal bar at row +4 (though detection doesn't verify the bottom bar exists, it assumes and draws it).
 * Detection scans row-by-row for top bars, but skips 5 rows after finding one to avoid overlapping detections; it allows side positions to be background (which could falsely detect incomplete shapes) and doesn't check for the bottom bar or any middle connections during detection—middles are added post-detection based on rules.
 * Middle connections are drawn only on the relative row +2 (third row of the shape), using positions from `get_middle_positions` that depend on `c` (e.g., 3 gets dense [2,4,6,8]; 1 gets sparse [8], optionally +6; 2 gets minimal or none) and modulated by `start_row % 10` (e.g., mod==3 adds extras for some `c` like 1 or 2)—this suggests position-dependent stylization, perhaps for a scrolling or modular display puzzle where row position affects rendering.
 * Drawing overwrites the new grid `h` (initialized to background) with `c` for bars/sides/middles, explicitly clears inner positions (1-9 relative) to background on middle rows (even if they were something else), and draws the bottom bar unconditionally (potentially adding missing bottoms).
 * Grid bounds are handled (e.g., no drawing if out of bounds), but assumes uniform row length `m`; shapes are 11 cells wide (relative 0-10), but observed outputs show 12 cells filled, suggesting possible off-by-one in slicing or indexing (e.g., j to j+11).
 * Background identification uses simple mode (most common value); assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.
 * Subtlety: No handling for overlapping shapes, multiple shapes per row, or non-bar artifacts—detection is greedy and vertical-only. Colors like 6 and 8 have defined middles but aren't in test; undefined `c` (e.g., 5,7) would fail silently with empty positions. Row mod 10 implies a 10-row repeating pattern, easy to miss if not considering positional variance.
 * Considerations from logic: Input likely has clean shapes (solid sides, empty middles, full top/bottom), but program could "fix" incomplete ones by adding middles/bottoms; if puzzle requires exact reproduction without additions, this over-draws.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided submission; it succeeded on all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic shape detection and drawing for those cases (likely similar stacked or isolated bar shapes).
 * Worked well for detecting tops and validating middle rows, adding position-dependent middles without over-drawing extras where not needed (e.g., no mod==3 triggers in training?).
 * Potential issue: Width seems 12 cells in outputs (col 1-12 filled) vs. code's 11 (j to j+10); this off-by-one worked for training but could be fragile—unknown if training inputs matched exactly or if slicing compensates.
 * Detection's allowance of bg on sides worked for training but might miss requiring solid `c` sides; no overlaps or edge cases in training.
 * `get_middle_positions` is essential and correctly applied (e.g., sparse for 1/2, dense for 3/4/6/8); mod 10 rule likely key for training variance.
 * Drawing clears inners explicitly, which is helpful to "clean" any noise, but if inputs are already clean, it's redundant—worked fine.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all components (background ID, detection, positions, drawing) are relevant and integrated well. No broken elements noted, but bottom bar is drawn without input verification, which succeeded in training (assuming all shapes complete).

**Test output:**
 * The test output reconstructs a 27-row x 23-col grid with background 8 and four vertically stacked shapes (c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), separated by single empty rows (6,12,18,24-26 all 8s); this matches expected detection logic (skipping 5 rows post-find, starting at i=1,7,13,19 assuming 0-indexed input with top bars there).
 * For c=2 (start_i=1, mod=1 !=3): top/bottom full (col1-12=2), sides only on rows2-4 (col1+12=2, inners 8), no extra middles on row3—looks correct, reproduces a minimal '2'-like shape without additions.
 * For c=4 (start_i=7, mod=7): similar full bars/sides, but middles on row9 at relative 6+8 (col7+9=4, plus sides col1+11)—matches [8,4,8s,8,4,8,4,8,4,8s pattern; looks correct for a '4' with crossbar stubs.
 * For c=3 (start_i=13, mod=3): full bars/sides, middles on row15 at [0,2,4,6,8,10] relative (col1,3,5,7,9,11=3, evens 8)—matches every-other-column pattern; looks correct for a dense '3' or 'E'-like.
 * For c=1 (start_i=19, mod=9 !=3): full bars/sides, middles on row21 at [0,8,10] relative (col1,9,11=1)—matches sparse [8,1,8s x7,1,8,1,8...]; looks correct for a '1' with hook.
 * Overall, test output makes sense and appears correct: it faithfully redraws detected shapes with rule-based middles, cleaning inners to 8; width (12 cells) is consistent but possibly off-by-one from code's 11 (e.g., j+11 filled?), but patterns align perfectly with logic—no extras, no misses, and mod 10 didn't trigger additions here. If expected is exact input copy, this matches assuming clean input; if puzzle requires no additions (e.g., copy without mod-based fills), it's still close but potentially over-interprets middles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:48:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors, where the task is to detect and reconstruct specific 5-row-high shapes (stylized symbols or digits) from input grid `g` by identifying top horizontal bars and associated vertical sides, then redrawing them cleanly on a uniform background in output grid `h`, including color-specific middle connections on the relative second row of each shape. The shapes do not overlap, and reconstruction must precisely match expected patterns, including subtle variations in middle bar positions based on color and potentially grid position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background `bg` is correctly identified as the most common value in the grid using a counter on flattened list.
 * Shapes are 11 columns wide (full top/bottom bars from relative k=0 to k=10), with vertical sides only at k=0 (left) and k=10 (right) on relative rows 1-3, and all inner positions (k=1 to 9) must be `bg` on those rows for valid detection.
 * Detection starts from top bars (11 consecutive non-`bg` cells of same color), verifies sides on next 3 rows (sides must be color or `bg`, inners strictly `bg`), but does not verify bottom bar during detection—bottom is always drawn on relative row 4 as full 11-cell bar.
 * After detecting a shape at (start_i, start_j, color), skip ahead by 5 rows (i += 5) assuming non-overlapping 5-row shapes; increment by 1 if no shape found.
 * Middle connections are drawn only on relative row 2 (start_i + 2), overwriting after clearing inners to `bg`; positions depend on color `c`, and in some cases on start_j or start_i (e.g., modulo conditions), using even/odd relative k positions to create dashed or partial bars.
 * Subtlety: For some colors like 2, middle positions vary by grid position (e.g., i % 10 == 3 triggers an extra position), suggesting position-dependent shape variants (e.g., mirrored or shifted patterns in different grid sections); this is easy to miss and leads to mismatches.
 * Drawing always sets top bar full color, sides full color (overriding any `bg`), inners `bg` on rows 1-3, specific middles on row 2, and bottom bar full color on row 4, even if input had variations.
 * Grid boundaries must be respected (no drawing beyond n or m), and output initializes to all `bg`.
 * Shapes may appear in any column start_j (as long as +10 < m), but examples show start_j=1 with padding `bg` on sides.
 * No overlapping shapes or partial detections; if top bar is `bg`, it's not a shape.
 * Colors like 1,2,3,4,6,8 have specific middle patterns (e.g., 8 and 3 get full dashed [2,4,6,8] + sides; 4 gets partial [6,8]; 1 gets [8] + conditional [6] if j==1); unhandled colors default to only sides [0,10].
 * Easy to miss: Inners cleared to `bg` on rows 1-3 before middles, so middles overwrite selectively; sides can be `bg` in input but are forced to color in output.
 * Detection allows sides to be `bg` in input ( !=c and !=bg invalidates), but examples have them as color; this flexibility might handle noisy input but isn't used in provided examples.
 * Bottom bar drawn unconditionally, but examples always have it; no check for its presence in input.
 * Grid sizes: Examples are 22-28 rows x 23 columns, with shapes stacked vertically separated by 1-2 `bg` rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List, Tuple

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies `bg` as the mode; essential and works in all cases.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, j: int, i: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 3 or c == 8:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        pos.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 4:
        pos.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if j == 1:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if i % 10 == 3:
            pos.append(9)
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(This determines middle positions per color/position; helpful but buggy for c=2—appends 9 instead of 8 when i%10==3, causing mismatches; extend for more colors if needed.)

```python
def detect_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    m = len(g[0])
    shapes = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 3:
        found = False
        for start_j in range(m - 10):  # Up to m-11 effectively
            row_slice = g[i][start_j : start_j + 11]
            if len(set(row_slice)) == 1 and row_slice[0] != bg:
                color = row_slice[0]
                valid = True
                for r in range(1, 4):
                    if i + r >= n:
                        valid = False
                        break
                    row_r = g[i + r]
                    left = row_r[start_j]
                    right = row_r[start_j + 10]
                    if (left != color and left != bg) or (right != color and right != bg):
                        valid = False
                        break
                    for k in range(1, 10):
                        if start_j + k >= m or row_r[start_j + k] != bg:
                            valid = False
                            break
                if valid:
                    shapes.append((i, start_j, color))
                    found = True
                    break
        if found:
            i += 5
        else:
            i += 1
    return shapes
```
(This detects shape starts accurately for provided examples, handling vertical skips and inner `bg` checks; essential and works well, but could add bottom bar verification for robustness; note range(m-10) allows start_j up to m-11.)

```python
def draw_shape(h: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, c: int, positions: List[int], bg: int, n: int, m: int) -> None:
    # Draw top bar
    for k in range(11):
        if start_i < n and start_j + k < m:
            h[start_i][start_j + k] = c
    # Draw sides and clear inners for relative rows 1-3
    for r in range(1, 4):
        row_idx = start_i + r
        if row_idx >= n:
            continue
        # Sides
        if start_j < m:
            h[row_idx][start_j] = c
        if start_j + 10 < m:
            h[row_idx][start_j + 10] = c
        # Clear inners
        for k in range(1, 10):
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[row_idx][start_j + k] = bg
    # Draw middle positions on relative row 2
    mid_row = start_i + 2
    if mid_row < n:
        for k in positions:
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[mid_row][start_j + k] = c
    # Draw bottom bar if possible
    bot_row = start_i + 4
    if bot_row < n:
        for k in range(11):
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[bot_row][start_j + k] = c
```
(This reconstructs each shape correctly once positions are right; helpful, handles boundaries, forces sides to color and clears inners properly; the unconditional bottom draw works for examples but might overdraw if input lacks it.)

(The overall `program` function orchestrates bg identification, detection, position calc, and drawing; solid structure but inherits bugs from `get_middle_positions`.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (c=4,8,2 shapes, bg=1, start_j=1): Mostly correct—detected all shapes, drew frames/sides/inners/bg accurately, middles correct for 4 ([6,8]) and 8 ([2,4,6,8]), top/bottom bars full; but incorrect for 2 at start_i=13 (i%10==3 triggers append(9) in middles, drawing extra 2 at relative k=9/col10 while leaving k=8/col9 as bg, resulting in [...,1 (col9),2 (col10),2 (col11),...] instead of expected [...,2 (col9),1 (col10),2 (col11),...]; this mismatches the partial middle bar for 2 variant.
 * Training example 2: Fully correct (all shapes detected and redrawn matching expected, including middles; no specifics given but implies handled colors/positions well).
 * Training example 3: Fully correct (similar to 2; suggests code handles common cases like c=1,3,4,8 without position dependencies).
 * The i%10==3 condition for c=2 is a subtle attempt to handle position-variant shapes but uses wrong position (9 instead of 8), causing the only mismatch; easy to miss that 2 needs a left-shifted partial middle in certain grid sections.
 * Detection skips (i +=5) works, preventing overlap, but assumes fixed 5-row height—fine for examples but might fail taller/shorter shapes.
 * No unhandled colors in train1, but code defaults to [0,10] for others (only sides, no middles), which could fail new colors.
 * No extraction of individual objects beyond detection; the `detect_shapes` acts as an object extractor, returning list of (i,j,c) tuples—helpful and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, shapes for c=2 at i=1, c=4 at i=7, c=3 at i=13, c=1 at i=19, all start_j=1) looks correct overall: detection found all top bars, frames/sides/inners accurate, bottom bars drawn, middles match patterns—c=2 only sides [0,10] since i=1%10!=3 (full bg inners on row3, as shown [8,2,8x8,2,8,...]); c=4 partial [6,8] on row9 ([8,4,8x5,4,8,4,8,4,8,...] with bg at k=7/9); c=3 full dashed [2,4,6,8] like 8 on row15 ([8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,8,...] c at even k, bg at odd k=1,3,5,7,9); c=1 [6,8] since j=1 on row21 ([8,1,8x5,1,8,1,8,1,8,...]).
 * It makes sense and appears to match what a correct output should be, assuming these are standard shape patterns without the position-variant issue from train1 (no c=2 with i%10==3 here, so no bug triggered); patterns resemble stylized digits (e.g., 2 as open top-half, 4 as partial cross, 3/8 as full middle, 1 as right-heavy).
 * However, if the test expected a different variant for c=3 or 1 based on position (e.g., i%10 for 13=3 or 19=9), it might mismatch subtly, but based on code logic and consistency with train2/3, it looks correct—no obvious differences from expected patterns.
 * Extra `bg` rows (e.g., rows 0,6,12,18,24-27 all 8) are properly left as bg, no overdraw.

[2025-09-30 21:48:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based representations of digits (likely 0-9 in a blocky, 5-row by 11-column format inspired by 7-segment displays but expanded), where the task is to detect incomplete digit shapes, complete them by filling in missing pixels according to standard digit patterns, remove stray or extraneous pixels outside the main content area, and ensure the background is consistently applied. The grids contain multiple digits separated by background, with a consistent background color per grid, and the program must process the entire grid without altering valid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are structured in fixed 5-row by 11-column blocks: row 0 (top) is a full horizontal bar of the digit color; rows 1-3 have vertical sides at columns 0 and 10, with inner pixels as background except for specific middle-row patterns; row 4 (bottom) is a full horizontal bar.
 * Background is the most common value in the grid (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test); non-background values represent digit colors (e.g., 4 for '4', 8 for '8', 2 for '2').
 * Detection requires scanning for top full bars (11 consecutive non-background pixels), verifying side columns (0 and 10) for the next 3 rows, then applying digit-specific patterns only to the middle row (row 2 relative to top) at specific relative columns (e.g., for digit 6/8: even positions 0,2,4,6,8,10; for 4: 6 and 8? but code has [6,8] which may be incomplete).
 * Stray removal: Identify the rightmost extent of valid content (e.g., longest horizontal bar of 11), then blank everything to the right of that column across all rows to remove trailing artifacts.
 * Subtleties: Patterns must match exact digit identities (code's patterns for 1:[6,8,10], 2:[8,10], 3:[6,8,10], 4:[6,8], 6/8:[0,2,4,6,8,10] suggest a right-leaning or asymmetric design, but this fails for symmetric digits like 8); inner pixels in rows 1-3 must be set to background after detection to "hollow out" the digit; bottom row only filled if space exists (i+4 < n); multiple digits stacked vertically without overlap; no diagonal or irregular shapes—strict horizontal/vertical bars only.
 * Easy to miss: Overlapping or adjacent digits (none in examples, but scan avoids j +10 overlap); variable grid sizes (22x23 in examples); incomplete inputs have partial sides/middles, so detection relies on top bar + sides; code fills middles unconditionally if top/sides match, but may overfill if patterns wrong; strays can appear as single pixels or partial bars (e.g., stray 8 in train1 row 20 col 11); background identification must ignore small counts; no rotation or scaling—fixed orientation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it partially handles background/strays but fails digit completion; must avoid filling non-digit bars (e.g., full-width backgrounds); patterns seem mismatched (e.g., digit 1 shouldn't have [6,8,10]—likely just right vertical); test grid has digits 2,4,3,1 stacked, but filling ignores some asymmetries; ensure no modification to already correct parts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the background color as the most frequent value in the grid. Helpful for distinguishing digits from empty space."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    """Finds the rightmost column with a valid 11-pixel horizontal bar (potential digit top/bottom). Useful for determining content bounds to remove strays."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):  # Scan for 11-length bars
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = True
            for k in range(1, 11):
                if g[i][j + k] != c:
                    is_bar = False
                    break
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Clears all pixels to the right of max_r to background. Essential for removing trailing stray pixels without affecting main content."""
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```

The main `program` function integrates these but has flawed digit detection/filling (e.g., incorrect patterns dict, overfills inners without checking existing state, assumes all detected are digits without validation). No types like PuzzleElement needed yet—grids are simple List[List[int]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/test) and applies it consistently.
 * Stray removal via find_max_r and remove_strays works partially: in train1, it fails to remove the stray 8 at row 20 col 11 (generated has it, expected blanks to 1); in train2/3/test, no visible strays post-removal, but doesn't affect failures.
 * Digit detection finds top full bars and side checks correctly (e.g., detects all 5-row blocks in all trains), and hollows inner rows 1-3 to background while keeping sides.
 * Digit filling fails across all: patterns dict is incomplete/wrong (e.g., no entry for 1 in train2/ test leads to no middle fill, but generated shows partial fills—possibly fallback or bug; for 4 in train1/ test, fills middle at wrong positions like col 9/11 extra; for 2 in train1/ test, row 2 has extra 2 at col 9 vs expected blank; for 8 in train1/train2, overfills middle to full bar instead of segments; for 3 in train3/ test, row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but expected only sides + specific like col 5/7/9? unknown exact but mismatched; for 1 in train2/ test, row 2/4 have misplaced 1s at col 8/10 vs expected minimal right vertical).
 * Bottom row filling applies full bars where space exists, but in train3 for 2's row 4, it doesn't match expected (generated has full but positions off? actually similar but upstream errors propagate).
 * Train1: Generated nearly matches expected except stray 8 remains and minor 4-pattern mismatch in row 3 col 9/11 (extra 4s).
 * Train2: Mismatches in 1's block—row 4 col 10 is 8 (background?) vs expected 1; row 2 col 8/10 extra 8s vs expected blanks/1s; 6's row 2 has 6 at col 4/6/8 missing vs expected more segments; 4's row 2 col 8 extra 4 vs expected blank.
 * Train3: 2's row 3 has extra 2 at col 11 vs expected blank; 4 and 1 blocks have similar pattern errors as above (e.g., 1's row 2 col 7/9 extra).
 * No extraction function for individual objects/digits present—detection is inline scanning, which is helpful but brittle; could add one to isolate 5x11 blocks for cleaner processing.
 * The patterns dict is broken/not helpful (wrong positions for digits like 1/3, missing 0/5/7/9); don't reuse without redesign based on exact segment maps.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure/background/strays (60% correct) but fails completion logic, leading to all INCORRECT.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it attempts to complete digits 2,4,3,1 (inferred from colors/patterns) but mismatches expected digit shapes based on training patterns: for 2 (rows 1-5), row 2 has 2 only at col 0/10 (good) but row 3 has extra 2 at col 9/11 vs expected blanks for curved top; bottom full (good); for 4 (rows 7-11), row 2 extra 4 at col 7/9/11 vs expected verticals + cross; for 3 (rows 13-17), row 2 has 3 at col 7/9/11 but likely missing middle horizontals (e.g., expected col 4-6/8-10? unknown but inconsistent with train3); for 1 (rows 19-23), row 2 extra 1 at col 7/9/11 vs expected simple right vertical (col 8-10 only?); no strays visible, but full bottoms added where not present in input (assuming input partial). This suggests pattern dict overfills asymmetrically, ignoring true 7-segment rules (e.g., 1 should be minimal, 3 has two horizontals). To handle test, redesign patterns to match symmetric/exact segments (e.g., derive from expected trains: 8 full even cols middle, 4 only cross at col 5-6? but unclear—need to reverse-engineer from differences).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires processing a grid to identify and complete incomplete "symbol" frames that represent digits (likely 0-9 in a stylized bar or 7-segment-like format), where each symbol is an 11-column-wide, 4- or 5-row-high structure using specific numbers as "ink" colors (e.g., 2 for curved bottoms, 4 for middles, 8 for tops), against a uniform background number. The program detects frames based on partial borders and fills them with standard digit patterns, clearing interiors and adding symbol-specific middle-row bars, while trimming extraneous pixels beyond the main content area.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common number in the grid (e.g., 1, 3, or 8); symbols use distinct non-background numbers as colors (c), implying each c corresponds to a specific digit shape (e.g., c=4 for '4' with diagonal middle bars, c=8 for '8' with alternating middle bars, c=2 for '2' with right-leaning middle bars).
 * Symbols are fixed 11 columns wide (positions l to l+10 = r); detection scans for horizontal "bars" of 11 consecutive c cells in top/bottom rows, plus vertical side connections (at l and r) in intervening rows.
 * Frame types include: full 5-row (top/bottom full, sides in rows 1-3); 4-row (middle row as top bar, bottom full, sides below); bottom-incomplete (top full, full sides in rows 1-3, but no bottom bar—though code requires sides up to row 3, which may misdetect).
 * Completion always fills top/bottom with full 11 c bars, vertical sides with c, clears inner areas to background; middle row (often row i+2) gets only sides set to c, interiors cleared, then symbol-specific additions (e.g., diagonal or vertical bars at even/odd offsets from l).
 * Subtle pattern variations per c: For c=4 ('4'), middle adds bars at relative positions ~6,8 (absolute cols l+6, l+8, e.g., 7,9 if l=1); for c=2 ('2'), adds at ~7,9 (l+7,l+9, e.g., 8,10); for c=8 ('8'), preserves or adds alternating every-other (e.g., cols 1,3,5,7,9,11); for c=1/3 ('1' or '3'), adds right-side verticals at ~6,8,10 or 7,9,11—code often off-by-one (starts at 5/6 instead of 6/7). For c=2, code skips additions entirely, but should add right-leaning bars.
 * l (frame start column) affects relative positioning, but code's get_s_rel(c, l) only handles l==1 or 2 specially (returns hardcoded offsets like 5 for c=4/l=1, 8 for c=2/l=1, 6 for c=1/l=2), defaults to 0 otherwise—misuse of l (it's a column, not row/type), causing no additions for l>2 or wrong starts (e.g., p=5,7,9 → cols 6,8,10 instead of expected 7,9,11).
 * Stray removal: After finding rightmost bar end (max_r), set all columns > max_r to background—works but assumes horizontal layout, may clip if symbols overlap or extend right.
 * Order matters: Process 5-row frames first, then 4-row, then bottom-incomplete; each completion overwrites grid, so early detections can affect later ones (e.g., filling one frame completes another).
 * Inputs have partial frames (e.g., missing middle bars or top/bottom); if already complete (e.g., '8' middle patterned), detection may skip, preserving input—good for correct cases but risks incomplete ones being overwritten wrong.
 * Grid size ~23x23; symbols stacked vertically with background rows separating; no horizontal overlaps, but right strays possible.
 * Easy to miss: Digit-specific patterns aren't uniform (not all add every 2 steps from same start); c=2 needs special handling (add bars despite if c!=2 check); off-by-one in relative positioning (e.g., start at l+6 not l+5 for many); bottom-incomplete detection requires top full but only completes up to row i+3 without bottom, mismatching name/logic.
 * No rotation/scaling; assume row-major, left-to-right symbols starting at cols like 1,12, etc.

    return h
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 (c=4 '4', c=8 '8', c=2 '2'): Incorrect—'4' middle row (row 3) generated bars at cols 6,8,10 (from s_rel=5 → l+5,7,9) but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, missing col 11 interior but border covers); '8' middle (row 9) correctly preserved alternating pattern [8 at 1,3,5,7,9,11] as detection skipped (already complete?), no overwrite; '2' middle (row 15) generated only borders (no additions due to if c != 2 skip) but expected additions at 8,10 (right-leaning bars); bottom empty rows correct.
 * Train 2: Correct—likely had frames that matched exact detection/completion (e.g., no middle additions needed or c=2 handled implicitly by input).
 * Train 3 (c=2 '2', c=4 '4', c=1 '1'): Incorrect—'4' middle (row 9) generated at 6,8,10 but expected 7,9 (off-by-one, similar to train 1); '1' middle (row 16) generated at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5 for c=1/l=1) but expected 7,9,11 (right verticals, off-by-one); '2' top (rows 1-5) correctly only borders/cleared (but if it needed middle, would fail like train 1); detection/completion order worked for upper frames but middle patterns wrong.
 * Overall: Background ID, stray removal, and frame detection (for full borders) worked well (preserved correct '8', cleared interiors); completion overwrites correctly for borders but fails on symbol-specific middles (wrong offsets, skips c=2, l>2 defaults to 0 additions); 4-row and bottom-incomplete detections not triggered in samples (or ineffective); get_s_rel broken (hardcoded for l=1/2 only, wrong values like 5 instead of 6, skips c=2); no handling for c=3/8 patterns (e.g., '3' might need 7,9,11 like '1', '8' alternating preserved by luck).
 * Function detect_5row_frames helpful but strict (requires full top/bottom + sides 1-3, misses partials); complete_5row useful base but middle logic flawed (off-by-one, c=2 skip); detect_4row_frames and complete_4row similar but unused in samples (potentially broken for top-missing cases); detect_bottom_incomplete and complete_bottom_incomplete misnamed/mismatched (requires top but no bottom fill, adds middle anyway—unhelpful for true bottoms, don't rely); program orchestration (process 5 then 4 then bottom) good but order may cause overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (background=8, symbols c=2 '2' rows 1-5, c=4 '4' rows 7-11, c=3 '3' rows 13-17, c=1 '1' rows 19-23) does not look correct—patterns match train errors: '2' middle (row 3) only borders, no additions (c=2 skip, but likely needs 8,10 like train 1); '4' middle (row 9) bars at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9); '3' middle (row 15) at 7,9,11 (s_rel=6 for c=3/l=1? code returns 6 for c=3/l=1, but if '3' expects different like full or 6,8,10, it's wrong—unknown but inconsistent with other off-by-one fixes); '1' middle (row 21) at 6,8,10 (s_rel=5, off-by-one from expected ~7,9,11 like train 3); extra full background rows at bottom correct, but stray removal likely applied (no right noise); overall, middles are incomplete/wrong-positioned, suggesting incomplete digit shapes (e.g., '1' looks jagged left instead of right vertical); does not match expected digit rules, as patterns are consistently offset and c=2 bare—needs offset fix to +1 (e.g., s_rel +=1) and c=2 handling (e.g., s_rel=7 step 2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or pixel values, where the background is the dominant value, and embedded are rectangular "object" blocks (typically 11 columns wide and 4-5 rows high) of a specific color c ≠ background, resembling dot-matrix or Braille-like patterns for letters/symbols. The task of the program is to detect these blocks, clear their interiors to background except for shape-defining "dots" (placements of c) in specific middle row positions based on c (and sometimes starting column j), handle height variations (e.g., extending or shifting blocks if bottom rows are full), and output a reconstructed grid showing only the cleaned block regions with the rendered patterns, filling everything else with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Always the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 1 in training example 1, 8 in training examples 2 and test).
 * Block detection: Scan row-by-row (i from 0 to n-5 step 1 or 5 if processed), column-by-column (j from 0 to m-11); requires top row i full c across j to j+10, sides (j and j+10) = c for rows i+1 to i+3, interiors (j+1 to j+9) = background for rows i+1 and i+2 only (row i+3 checked separately for fullness).
 * Height handling: Base 4 rows (i to i+3); if row i+3 full c, check if i+4 full for 5-high "double" block (fill interiors i+1 to i+3, place dots in i+2); if i+3 full but i+4 not, treat as "bottom-heavy" and extend upward (set i-1 full c if possible, fill i interiors, place dots in i+1, block from i-1 to i+3); if i+3 not full, base 4-high but force set i+4 to full c if exists (extend to 5-high, place dots in i+2).
 * Dot placement: After filling interiors to background, place c only in middle row (i+2 for standard/double, i+1 for upward shift) at relative positions k in [0,10] specific to c (e.g., sides always included, but middles vary); positions depend on c and sometimes j (L=j as parameter); subtle hack in code for c=1 and j=2 adds extra dot in i+1 at j+8, but only in double-full branch.
 * Reconstruction: Build final grid as all background, then overlay modified block regions (from start_row to end_row, left to right cols) copying the altered h values; skip non-block areas.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Detection skips if top not full or sides/inners fail; increment i by 5 after processing to skip block height; for c=1, positions change with j (e.g., L=1: [0,6,8,10]; L=2: [0,8,10]), suggesting position-dependent shapes (perhaps aligned to grid edges); upward extension only if i-1 >=0 and skips if not; forcing i+4 full can alter input patterns unexpectedly; patterns are asymmetric (e.g., not all evens for c=6/8); blocks don't overlap but scan order matters (top-to-bottom may miss shifted ones); grid size fixed ~23x23 in examples, but general; no rotation/flipping, patterns are upright.
 * All considerations: Avoid modifying outside bounds (code checks 0 <= j+p < m); counter for bg robust; typing List[List[int]]; process modifies copy h of g; blocks list tracks regions for final overlay; potential bug in placement row for extended 5-high non-full i+3 cases (code places i+2 but outputs suggest i+3 sometimes); for some c (2,6,1), positions incomplete/mismatched, leading to missing dots; c=8 may mirror c=6 but code treats same (evens, potentially wrong); no handling for overlapping or non-11-wide; assume single block per color vertically stacked with bg separators.

    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]

```
(This is helpful and correct for finding the dominant background value quickly.)

(This is partially helpful as a centralized way to define per-c positions, but broken/incomplete for c=2 (needs [0,8,10] based on train1), c=6 (needs [0,4,6,8,10] not evens based on train2), and c=1 L=2 (placement row or extra logic wrong); the j-dependency for c=1 is a good consideration but hacky—generalize if more examples.)

The main program function is helpful for structure (detection, modification, reconstruction) but has bugs in branch logic (e.g., dot row for extended blocks, missing positions), so refine rather than discard; blocks list as List[tuple] for regions is useful for overlay.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall attempt detects block structure and background correctly, works for c=3,4,8 in some cases (e.g., train3 correct, parts of test), and handles height extension/upward shift partially.
 * Failed for c=2 in train1: generated middle row (row15, i+2) only sides [0,10] as 2's, but expected [0,8,10] with extra 2 at rel8 (col9); all other rows match, so subtle missing middle dot.
 * Failed for c=6 in train2: generated middle row (row10, i+2) 6's at even rel [0,2,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,4,6,8,10,12), but expected at [0,4,6,8,10] (cols 2,6,8,10,12, missing col4=bg, extra col4=6 wrong); row11 (i+3?) also mismatched pattern slightly; 1's and 4's mostly match but 1's has extra/misplaced dots.
 * Failed for c=1 in train2: generated row5 (i+3?) has extra 1's at rel8 and10 (cols10,12) beyond sides, but expected only sides [0,10] in both row4 (i+2) and row5; code intends placement in i+2=row4 at [0,8,10] for L=2 but generated shows no extra in row4 (stays sides-only) and misplaced extra in row5 (unknown why—likely branch bug shifting placement row for non-full i+3 extended blocks); row3 and row6 match expected.
 * Succeeded for train3 (full match, likely used supported c like 3/4 with correct positions).
 * get_middle_positions essential but insufficient (wrong for c=2,6; c=1 L=2 positions correct but application row wrong); identify_background essential and works.
 * The upward extension logic (for is_r3_full but not double) helpful for bottom-detected blocks but not triggered in failures (e.g., train2 1's used standard else branch incorrectly).
 * Special hack for c=1 j=2 extra dot in i+1 only in double-full branch unhelpful/inconsistent (not used in train2 1's else branch, causing miss).
 * No extraction of full objects beyond blocks list, but not needed—focus on in-place modification.
 * Scan increment i+=5 after process skips correctly but may miss if blocks <5 high.
 * Final reconstruction with max/min bounds helpful to avoid out-of-grid errors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense structurally (detects all blocks at j=1, bg=8, renders 11-wide 5-high for all with top/bottom full where appropriate, clears interiors correctly, overlays without overlap), but does not look fully correct based on training patterns.
 * For 2's (rows1-5, j=1): middle rows (3-4) only sides [0,10] as 2's (no extra dots), but train1 c=2 at similar j=1 expected extra at rel8 in i+2 (row3 should have [0,8,10]); missing middle dot makes it incomplete/wrong.
 * For 4's (rows7-11, j=1): middle row9 [0,6,8,10] as 4's (cols1,7,9,11) matches expected pattern from train2/code, correct.
 * For 3's (rows13-17, j=1): middle row15 [0,4,6,8,10] as 3's (cols1,5,7,9,11) matches code/expected style, correct.
 * For 1's (rows20-24? but n=23? rows20-23 + forced? ): top row20 full, row21 sides only, row22 sides only (should be i+2 placement), row23 [0,6,8,10] as 1's (cols1,7,9,11) for L=1; placement in row23 (i+3) instead of row22 (i+2) wrong per code/logic, similar to train2 1's misplacement (generated shifts to wrong row, leaving i+2 sides-only); extra dots correct positions but row wrong, and no forced row24 since n=23.
 * Overall, test misses 2's middle dot and misplaces 1's row (like train failures); looks like code's position/branch bugs persist; to fix, adjust c=2 to [0,8,10], c=1 placement to correct row for extended non-full i+3 (perhaps place in i+3 if forcing i+4), confirm no j-dependency for c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and rendering of digit-like shapes (e.g., representations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) in a grid, where shapes are built from 11-wide horizontal bars of a specific color `c` on an 8-background, with vertical "legs" extending downward, optional full bottom bars, and specific patterned connections in the middle row (i+2) of the 5-row shape, potentially influenced by the starting row modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 11 columns wide (from j to j+10), starting with a full top bar of `c` at row i, followed by 3 rows with `c` only at the edges (j and j+10) and background (8) in between, a patterned middle row at i+2 with additional `c` positions based on the digit type (`c` value), and potentially a full bottom bar at i+3 (if the input has it full) and another at i+4.
 * Background is identified as the most common value (always 8 in examples), and the output grid `h` starts as all background, then overwrites detected shape positions with `c` (filling tops, bottoms, edges, and middle patterns) while ensuring middle rows 1-3 (i+1 to i+3) have background in non-edge/non-pattern positions.
 * Detection scans row-by-row (skipping 5 rows after a match to avoid overlap), checking for full 11-wide top bar of non-bg `c`, edge legs down 3 rows, and no non-bg intrusions in middle sections of those legs; if valid, render the full shape in `h`, including conditional full fill of i+3 if input has it full.
 * Subtlety: Middle row (i+2) patterns depend on `c` (digit type) and sometimes i % 10 (row modulo), but the modulo condition is buggy—e.g., for c=1, it only adds positions if i % 10 == 3, but examples show needs differ (e.g., train 2's '1' at i=2 requires extra position regardless). For c=3 and c=4/6/8, patterns are more consistent (e.g., every-other or specific offsets), but c=1/2 are sparser and modulo-sensitive in a way that's not fully captured.
 * Grids are n rows by m=23 columns, with shapes aligned starting at various j (e.g., j=2 for some, j=1 for test), and shapes don't overlap vertically (5-row height + skip).
 * Easy to miss: The i+4 full bar is always filled in output if space allows, even if input doesn't have it; row i+3 is only full-filled if input row i+3 is fully `c` across 11; patterns must exactly match expected positions (e.g., for '1' in train 2, relative positions 0,8,10 needed at i+2, but code adds wrong ones conditionally).
 * No horizontal stretching or partial widths—always exactly 11 wide; ignore isolated non-bg cells; process top-to-bottom without backtracking.
 * Potential for multiple shapes vertically stacked with 1-row bg gaps; c values represent digits (1,2,3,4,6,8), with 8 possibly being a special full block.

            else:
                positions.extend([8])
    return positions
```

The main `program` function is helpful overall for structure (bg init, row scanning, shape validation, rendering), but the detection loop has issues: it assumes fixed 11-wide, but validation for middle intrusions is strict (all bg in 1-9 for rows i+1/i+2, but allows for i+3 full); the found/break skips correctly but may miss if j-start varies; the row3_full check and conditional filling for i+3 is correct but underused.

No other functions provided; no object extraction helper (e.g., to isolate shapes), which could be useful for debugging but isn't present—future attempts should add one to verify input patterns before rendering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles shapes for c=4,6,8,3 in train 1/3 and test (e.g., '4' adds positions 0,6,8,10; '3' adds 0,2,4,6,8,10 for every-other pattern; '6' similar to '8' but sparser).
 * Train 1 and 3: Fully correct, likely because they feature c=4/6/8 or c=3 where middle positions are added unconditionally (no modulo dependency), and full bars/legs match exactly.
 * Train 2: Incorrect for the '1' shape (c=1 at i=2); generated middle row (i+2=4) has only edges (relative 0,10 → 1s at j=2 and j=12), but expected has 1s at relative 0,8,10 (j=2,10,12) with j=11 as 8; code fails to add [6,8] because i=2 %10=2 !=3, so no extension—modulo condition is wrong or too narrow, missing the inner connection needed for '1'.
 * General issue: For c=1/2, middle patterns are under-filled when i %10 !=3 (e.g., skips crossbars), leading to sparse middles; for other c, it works but assumes fixed offsets that may not generalize (e.g., c=3 adds [2,4,6,8] for every-other, correct for test but verify if always).
 * Shape detection works (finds tops, validates legs, fills edges/bg correctly), but rendering for i+2 is brittle; no handling for c=2 specifics (test '2' at i=1 %10=1 !=3, so only edges, but likely needs at least [8] or more for a '2' crossbar—unknown exact pattern, but generated looks incomplete).
 * The skip i+=5 after found is helpful to avoid overlap but assumes no adjacent shapes; validation loop for r=1-3 correctly checks edges and bg middles but could miss if input has minor noise.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions outright, but get_middle_positions is partially broken for c=1/2 (wrong conditional positions; e.g., adds [6,8] for c=1 but needs [8] or [8,10]?—mismatch in train 2); identify_background is solid and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it under-fills middle rows for '1' and '2' shapes while correctly handling '3' and '4'.
 * For '2' (rows 1-5, i=1, c=2, j=1): Top (row1) and bottom (row5) full from 1-11 (correct), edges in rows 2-4 (correct), but middle (row3=i+2) only edges (1 and 11), no additional pattern—likely incorrect, as '2' probably needs a crossbar (e.g., at relative 4-6 or 8) similar to train 2's '1'; generated looks like a hollow rectangle instead of a '2'.
 * For '4' (rows 7-11, i=7, c=4, j=1): Correct—middle (row9) has 4s at relative 0,6,8,10 (positions 1,7,9,11), matching a sparse '4' pattern with right-side connections.
 * For '3' (rows 13-17, i=13, c=3, j=1): Correct—middle (row15) has 3s at relative 0,2,4,6,8,10 (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 every-other), giving a filled '3' look; no modulo issue since unconditional for c=3.
 * For '1' (rows 19-23, i=19, c=1, j=1): Incorrect—middle rows 20-22 only edges (1 and 11? but printed as 1 at 1 and 11), no inner (e.g., missing relative 8 like train 2); i=19 %10=9 !=3, so no extension, resulting in hollow 'I' instead of connected '1'.
 * Overall, test output correctly detects all shapes and fills tops/bottoms/edges, but fails to add digit-specific middle patterns for c=1/2 due to modulo bug, making '1' and '2' appear incomplete (no crossbars); '3'/'4' look right, suggesting the issue is isolated to low-digit handling—update get_middle_positions to remove/rethink modulo for c=1/2 and infer patterns from examples (e.g., always [8] for c=1, [5,8] or similar for c=2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents segmented digit shapes (like stylized 7-segment or dot-matrix digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) embedded in a background color (e.g., 1 or 8), where the program must detect partial or incomplete digit patterns vertically stacked and complete them by filling in specific positions according to digit-specific rules, while cleaning up stray pixels beyond the main content area. The goal is to output a cleaned, completed grid matching the expected rendered digits without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Digits are 11 columns wide (positions 0-10) and span 5 rows vertically (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4), with detection starting from a solid top bar of 11 identical non-background cells.
 * Background identification uses the most common cell value; all non-pattern areas must be set to this background after processing.
 * Digit-specific filling: Left and right sides get vertical bars on rows i+1 to i+3; middle row (i+2) gets horizontal segments based on the digit (e.g., 4 and 8 have segments at 2,4,6,8; 3 at 2,4,6,8; 6 at 4,6,8; 2 varies by vertical position mod 10, e.g., append 8 if mod==3).
 * Vertical stepping: After detecting and filling a digit starting at row i, skip ahead by 5 rows (i +=5) if found, else increment by 1; this handles stacked digits without overlap.
 * Stray removal: After all processing, identify the rightmost extent of any 11-cell horizontal bar (non-background) to find max_r, then set all cells right of max_r+1 to background to trim trailing noise.
 * Subtle positioning: Middle segments for digit 2 depend on i % 10 (e.g., only append position 8 if mod==3), suggesting periodic or patterned stacking in the grid.
 * Detection validation: For rows i+1 to i+3, ensure left (j) and right (j+10) are either the digit color or background, but middle (j+1 to j+9) must be purely background; top must be fully solid digit color.
 * Easy to miss: Incomplete tops skip detection; over-filling can create artifacts (e.g., stray non-background in empty areas); mod-10 for 2 assumes row indexing starts at 0 and patterns repeat every 10 rows.
 * Grid dimensions: Assume rectangular n x m (m>=11, n variable up to 23+ in examples); empty grid returns empty.
 * No horizontal detection: Patterns are strictly vertical stacks, no rotation or sideways digits.
 * Color consistency: Digit color c is from the top bar; cannot mix colors within one digit.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection loop correctly identifies solid top bars and validates side/middle emptiness for digits like 4,8,2,3,1,6, filling vertical sides and digit-specific middles, which worked fully for Training example 3 (assumed to match expected digit stack).
 * Background identification and stray removal via max_r worked in all cases, preventing overflow but failing to trim an extraneous 8 in empty areas for Training 1.
 * Middle position logic via get_middle_positions is mostly correct (e.g., full segments for 3/8, partial for 4/6/1), but for digit 2, the mod==3 condition under-fills or misplaces (e.g., in Training 1 row 15, expected has 2 at positions like j+9 but generated misses some).
 * In Training 1 (bg=1, digits 4 at rows 1-5, 8 at 7-11, 2 at 13-17): Generated matches expected exactly except row 20 has a stray 8 at column 11 (0-indexed), turning an empty row into partial pattern; this suggests over-detection or incomplete clearing of a false top bar in lower empty space.
 * In Training 2 (bg=8, digits 1? at 2-6 but actually partial 1/mixed, 6 at 8-12, 4 at 14-18): Generated mismatches expected in row 4 (generated has extra 1s at j+8 and j+10? but expected shifts 1 at j+10 to j+9? wait, positions: generated row4 [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,...] vs expected [8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] – extra 1s at columns 8,10,12 in generated for the '1' shape, indicating over-filling middles or misdetecting as higher-segment digit like 4 instead of sparse 1; row 20-22 all 8s match but upper mismatches persist.
 * Vertical stepping (i+=5 on found) prevents overlap and works for spaced stacks, but in dense or partial inputs, it skips invalid partial tops correctly.
 * The program assumes all digits use the same c from top, which works but fails if input has mixed partials (e.g., Training 2's '1' seems sparse, but code treats as full if top solid).
 * Function find_max_r and remove_strays are helpful and correct for trimming, but in Training 1, max_r likely extended too far due to the stray 8, leaving it untrimmed (since it's within 0-12? columns).
 * No extraction of full objects; detection is inline scanning, which is efficient but misses isolated partials not starting with full top.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The validation loop sets valid=False on any non-bg/non-c in sides but allows bg in middles only; this is correct but brittle for partial inputs where sides have noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, apparent digits 2 at rows 1-5 but filled sparsely, 4 at 7-11 with middles at 6,8? but expected likely fuller, 3 at 13-17 with segments at 2,4,6,8, 1 at 19-23 sparse) looks partially correct but incomplete/mismatched: For the '2' at top, row 2-4 have only sides (positions 0,10 relative), missing middle crossbar entirely (expected for 2 should have partial middle like position 8 if mod!=3, but row1 mod=1%10=1, no append, so under-filled); '4' row9 has 4 at 7? (j+7=8th col) extra? vs expected sparse; '3' looks correct with full middles; '1' row21 has 1 at j+7 extra vs expected sides only.
 * Overall, test does not look fully correct: It over/under-fills middles inconsistently (e.g., '2' misses horizontal, '1' has extras like position 7), suggesting get_middle_positions lacks cases for 1 (only [0,10]? but generated has more) and mod logic for 2 is too restrictive (mod=1 for row1, no 8 added, but perhaps 2 always needs more); trimming works as right side is all 8s post-col12.
 * The output makes sense as an attempt to complete stacked digits (2,4,3,1 from shapes) but fails to match subtle segment rules, leaving artifacts like extra fills in '1' and missing in '2'; to fix, expand get_middle_positions for 1 (add [6,8]? based on Training2 mismatch) and adjust 2's mod conditions to always include certain positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or symbols, where the task is to process the input grid by identifying background (most common value), then detecting and rendering specific multi-row shapes (likely letters or glyphs) that start with horizontal bars of 11 identical non-background cells, extending vertically with side pillars and patterned middle rows based on the shape's "color" (number). The output is a cleaned or stylized version of the grid with backgrounds filled and shapes precisely drawn according to rules for each number type.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent number in the flattened grid; everything starts by filling the output with this value.
 * Shapes are detected starting from row i, looking for horizontal runs of exactly 11 consecutive non-background cells of the same value c in row i, columns j to j+10.
 * Validation requires the next 3 rows (i+1 to i+3) to have only c or bg at columns j and j+10 (side pillars), with all middle columns j+1 to j+9 being bg.
 * After detection, fill the top row (i) with c across j to j+10; fill pillars in rows i+1 to i+3 at j and j+10 with c; ensure middles in i+1 to i+3 are bg.
 * A middle row at i+2 gets special "positions" filled with c based on c: e.g., for 1/2 it's edges plus near-end (0,8,10); for 3/8 it's more positions like serifs (0,2,4,6,8,10); for 4 it's (0,6,8,10); for 6 it's (0,4,6,8,10); default edges only (0,10)—this seems to style letters differently (e.g., serifs for even/odd numbers?).
 * Bottom row at i+4 gets a full horizontal bar of c across j to j+10 if space allows, suggesting 5-row tall shapes.
 * Detection skips 5 rows after a match (i +=5), else increments by 1; assumes non-overlapping vertical stacking.
 * Subtlety: Positions in get_middle_positions are relative to the 11-cell width (0 to 10), but must check bounds; overfilling happens if positions like 8/9 are incorrectly applied to narrow or mismatched styles.
 * Grids are rectangular (n rows x m cols, m>=23?); empty grid returns empty.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may not span full width (only 11 cols wide, placed at various j); multiple shapes per grid, stacked vertically with bg gaps; no diagonal or irregular fills—strict horizontal/vertical rules.
 * Considerations: Potential overlaps not handled (but skipping 5 rows assumes no overlap); validation fails if rows out of bounds or middles not pure bg; c-specific middle patterns suggest numbers represent letter IDs with unique fonts (e.g., 1/2 simple, 3/8 ornate).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Must ensure middle fills don't bleed into pillars or exceed 11-width; increment logic may skip valid starts if partial matches occur.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = collections.Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background value, essential for initialization and validation; used in all processing.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int) -> List[int]:
    if c == 1 or c == 2:
        return [0, 8, 10]
    elif c == 3 or c == 8:
        return [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 4:
        return [0, 6, 8, 10]
    elif c == 6:
        return [0, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    else:
        return [0, 10]
```
(This provides c-specific positions for middle-row styling, key for differentiating shapes; helpful but needs bounds-checking to avoid overfill.)

(The main program loop is helpful for detection and filling but has issues with precise positioning; no other extraction functions shown, but mentally extracting "objects" as 5-row blocks starting with 11-bar could be added for debugging.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT—full shape detection and filling worked, including bg init and vertical skips.
 * Training example 2: CORRECT—handled multiple stacked shapes without overlap issues.
 * Training example 3: INCORRECT—overfilled middle rows for certain c (e.g., for c=2 in row 3, extra 2 at col 9 instead of bg; for c=4 in row 9, extra 4s at cols 7,9,11 instead of bg at 7/9; for c=1 in row 15, extra 1 at col 9 instead of bg)—suggests get_middle_positions applying too many or wrong positions (e.g., 8 maps to col j+8=9, bleeding for non-serif styles).
 * Missed precise bounds in middle fills: positions like 8/9 fill unintended spots when c lacks full serifs (e.g., 1/4/6 should avoid inner positions).
 * Increment logic (i+=5 after match) worked for non-overlaps but may skip if shapes are shorter/taller than 5 rows.
 * No extraction of full objects shown, but detection loop is essential for scanning; could add a function to extract candidate 5x11 subgrids for validation.
 * get_middle_positions is helpful but incomplete—may need more c cases (e.g., 5/7/9?) or conditionals for width.
 * Overall, bar detection and pillar validation succeeded, but c-specific styling over-applied patterns, causing pixel extras in 2/4/1 shapes (unknown why exactly for 4, perhaps misindexed positions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfill errors from training 3: e.g., in the 3's section (rows ~15-18), row 16 has excessive 3s every other column (cols 1,3,5,7,9,11) like [8,3,8,3,...], suggesting over-applied middle positions turning it into a dashed line instead of sparse pillars/serifs; expected likely sparser (e.g., only edges + few middles for c=3).
 * For 1's section (rows ~20-23), similar extra 1 at col 9 in row 22 ([8,1,8,8,...,8,1,8,1,...]), where expected should have only cols 1 and 11 as 1s, with bg elsewhere—indicating same positioning bug as in training 3's 1s.
 * Bottom extra full bg rows (24-27) may be correct if input has trailing space, but overall shapes look "noisy" with unintended fills, not clean glyphs; does not make sense for precise letter rendering, as extras distort patterns (e.g., 3's looks like erratic 'E' instead of structured).
 * Missing handling for potential larger grid (28 rows?) or different c (e.g., 3 here vs 1/2/4 in training); overfills suggest program applies ornate positions (like for 3/8) to simpler c, breaking minimal styles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the rendering or completion of digit-like patterns (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) in a grid using horizontal "bars" of length 11, vertical extensions, and selective middle connections, with 8 as the background color and other numbers (1-6,8) representing digit-specific colors/shapes. The program processes the input grid to detect these bars, validate surrounding emptiness or matches, and draw complete 5-row high symbols, skipping every 5 rows and cleaning stray pixels beyond the rightmost bar.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (8) dominates the grid and must be correctly identified via frequency counting; non-background cells indicate potential bar starts.
 * Horizontal bars must be exactly 11 cells long and uniform color (non-background); they trigger a full symbol draw only if the next 3 rows have matching or background at the ends (positions 0 and 10 relative to bar) and background in the middle 8 cells (positions 1-9).
 * Symbols span 5 rows: row 0 is the top bar; rows 1-3 have verticals at ends and cleared middles; row 2 adds digit-specific middle positions (e.g., for digit 2: positions 8 and optionally 6 based on row mod 10); row 4 is a bottom bar if space allows.
 * Digit (color) determines middle connections in row 2: e.g., 1 adds position 8 (and 6 if mod 10 == 3); 2 adds 8 if mod 3 == 0; 3 adds all even positions 2,4,6,8; 4 adds 6,8; 6 adds 4,6,8; 8 adds all 2,4,6,8. Positions are relative to bar start (0-10).
 * Processing scans row-by-row from top, skipping 5 rows after a valid symbol to handle stacked patterns; mod 10 on starting row adds vertical alignment subtlety for certain digits.
 * After drawing all symbols, find the rightmost bar end (max_r) and blank (set to background) all cells to its right to remove strays.
 * Grid assumes rectangular shape, all rows same length; empty or zero-size grids return empty.
 * Subtle: Validation fails if lower rows are out of bounds or have unexpected non-background/non-matching cells in required positions; middle clears are strict (must be background in input for validity, but output sets to background anyway).
 * No overlapping symbols assumed; scans left-to-right per row, breaks on first valid bar per potential symbol start.
 * Colors 5,7,9,0 not handled in middle positions (may be invalid or background variants).
 * Row mod 10 for alignment suggests periodic or multi-symbol grids with vertical staggering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background, e.g., 8; essential for distinguishing signals from noise.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 1:
        pos.append(8)
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(6)
    elif c == 2:
        if mod == 3:
            pos.append(8)
    elif c == 3:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 4:
        pos += [6, 8]
    elif c == 6:
        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(This maps digit colors to specific middle-bar positions in row 2, with mod-10 adjustment for some; critical for digit-specific shapes like the curve in 2 or cross in 4.)

```python
def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(g[0])
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m - 10):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == background:
                continue
            is_bar = all(g[i][j + k] == c for k in range(11))
            if is_bar:
                max_r = max(max_r, j + 10)
    return max_r
```
(This scans for all valid 11-cell bars post-draw and finds the global rightmost end column; used to trim strays correctly.)

```python
def remove_strays(g: List[List[int]], background: int, max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return g
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max_r + 1, m):
            h[i][j] = background
    return h
```
(This blanks columns right of max_r to background; prevents artifacts from partial or stray bars.)

(The main `program` function orchestrates detection, validation, drawing, and cleanup; it's helpful but could be modularized further for debugging symbol validation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly detecting bars, validating vertical/middle constraints, adding digit-specific middles, drawing bottom bars, and trimming strays.
 * Worked well for stacked digits with 5-row spacing and mod-10 alignments, as training passed without errors.
 * get_middle_positions handled digit variations (1,2,3,4,6,8) accurately for training shapes.
 * find_max_r and remove_strays effectively cleaned outputs without over-trimming valid parts.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: assumes bars start at integer j where full 11 fit; may skip if input has noise breaking exact 11-run.
 * Validation loop is strict on rows 1-3 (ends match c or bg, middles pure bg), which worked for clean training inputs but could fail on noisy tests.
 * i +=5 skip after found symbol prevents overlap, which was key for multi-digit training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (identify_background, etc.) are relevant and functional, though get_middle_positions lacks cases for colors 5,7,9 (possibly not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output renders four distinct 5-row high digit patterns separated by empty (all-8) rows: rows 1-5 show a '2' (top/bottom bars, left verticals, right verticals partial, middle connection at pos 8); rows 7-11 a '4' (top bar partial? wait, actually open top, verticals, middle cross at 6-8? but output shows irregular in row 9); rows 13-17 a '3' (top/bottom bars, right verticals, middles at evens); rows 18-22 a '1' (right-aligned vertical with top/bottom extensions, middle at 8 and 6?).
 * Overall, it looks mostly correct and sensible for a digit-rendering puzzle: background 8 fills empties, patterns match color-to-digit (2=blue?,4=green?,3=red?,1=yellow?), 11-wide bars at tops/bottoms, verticals at ends, selective middles per digit rules, and strays trimmed (output width ~23, with blanks after ~12).
 * Subtle differences noted: For '4' in rows 7-11, row 9 has extra 4's at positions ~7,9,11 (relative), which might be over-drawing middles or validation artifact—expected cleaner crossbar, but could be correct if input had noisy bar; unknown if this mismatches expected (e.g., if puzzle expects strict no-extras).
 * For '1', row 21 has 1 at pos ~9, which aligns with get_middle_positions for c=1 (pos 8), but if mod !=3, no pos6—looks mostly right but potential misalignment if test input row mod differs.
 * No complete failure; patterns are recognizable and rule-compliant, but '4' irregularity suggests possible validation looseness or input noise handling issue—still, it "makes sense" as completed symbols without gross errors like missing bars or untrimmed strays.
 * Trimming works: right side all 8 after ~12-13 cols, matching max_r logic.
 * If expected is pixel-perfect digits, minor extras in '4' and '3' (e.g., row 15 has dense 3's) might differ due to mod-10 or position calc; otherwise, it matches puzzle intent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors, where the task is to detect and reconstruct specific 5-row-high shapes (stylized symbols or digits) from input grid `g` by identifying top horizontal bars and associated vertical sides, then redrawing them cleanly on a uniform background in output grid `h`, including color-specific middle connections on the relative second row of each shape. The shapes do not overlap, and reconstruction must precisely match expected patterns, including subtle variations in middle bar positions based on color and potentially grid position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background `bg` is correctly identified as the most common value in the grid using a counter on flattened list.
 * Shapes are 11 columns wide (full top/bottom bars from relative k=0 to k=10), with vertical sides only at k=0 (left) and k=10 (right) on relative rows 1-3, and all inner positions (k=1 to 9) must be `bg` on those rows for valid detection.
 * Detection starts from top bars (11 consecutive non-`bg` cells of same color), verifies sides on next 3 rows (sides must be color or `bg`, inners strictly `bg`), but does not verify bottom bar during detection—bottom is always drawn on relative row 4 as full 11-cell bar.
 * After detecting a shape at (start_i, start_j, color), skip ahead by 5 rows (i += 5) assuming non-overlapping 5-row shapes; increment by 1 if no shape found.
 * Middle connections are drawn only on relative row 2 (start_i + 2), overwriting after clearing inners to `bg`; positions depend on color `c`, and in some cases on start_j or start_i (e.g., modulo conditions), using even/odd relative k positions to create dashed or partial bars.
 * Subtlety: For some colors like 2, middle positions vary by grid position (e.g., i % 10 == 3 triggers an extra position), suggesting position-dependent shape variants (e.g., mirrored or shifted patterns in different grid sections); this is easy to miss and leads to mismatches.
 * Drawing always sets top bar full color, sides full color (overriding any `bg`), inners `bg` on rows 1-3, specific middles on row 2, and bottom bar full color on row 4, even if input had variations.
 * Grid boundaries must be respected (no drawing beyond n or m), and output initializes to all `bg`.
 * Shapes may appear in any column start_j (as long as +10 < m), but examples show start_j=1 with padding `bg` on sides.
 * No overlapping shapes or partial detections; if top bar is `bg`, it's not a shape.
 * Colors like 1,2,3,4,6,8 have specific middle patterns (e.g., 8 and 3 get full dashed [2,4,6,8] + sides; 4 gets partial [6,8]; 1 gets [8] + conditional [6] if j==1); unhandled colors default to only sides [0,10].
 * Easy to miss: Inners cleared to `bg` on rows 1-3 before middles, so middles overwrite selectively; sides can be `bg` in input but are forced to color in output.
 * Detection allows sides to be `bg` in input ( !=c and !=bg invalidates), but examples have them as color; this flexibility might handle noisy input but isn't used in provided examples.
 * Bottom bar drawn unconditionally, but examples always have it; no check for its presence in input.
 * Grid sizes: Examples are 22-28 rows x 23 columns, with shapes stacked vertically separated by 1-2 `bg` rows.

    if not flat:
        return 0
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies `bg` as the mode; essential and works in all cases.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, j: int, i: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]
    if c == 3 or c == 8:
        pos.extend([2, 4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 6:
        pos.extend([4, 6, 8])
    elif c == 4:
        pos.extend([6, 8])
    elif c == 1:

    elif c == 2:
        if i % 10 == 3:
            pos.append(9)
    return sorted(set(pos))
```
(This determines middle positions per color/position; helpful but buggy for c=2—appends 9 instead of 8 when i%10==3, causing mismatches; extend for more colors if needed.)

                    if (left != color and left != bg) or (right != color and right != bg):
                        valid = False
                        break
                    for k in range(1, 10):
                        if start_j + k >= m or row_r[start_j + k] != bg:
                            valid = False
                            break
                if valid:

            i += 5
        else:
            i += 1
    return shapes
```
(This detects shape starts accurately for provided examples, handling vertical skips and inner `bg` checks; essential and works well, but could add bottom bar verification for robustness; note range(m-10) allows start_j up to m-11.)

```python
def draw_shape(h: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, c: int, positions: List[int], bg: int, n: int, m: int) -> None:

        if start_i < n and start_j + k < m:
            h[start_i][start_j + k] = c
    # Draw sides and clear inners for relative rows 1-3
    for r in range(1, 4):
        row_idx = start_i + r
        if row_idx >= n:
            continue
        # Sides
        if start_j < m:
            h[row_idx][start_j] = c
        if start_j + 10 < m:
            h[row_idx][start_j + 10] = c
        # Clear inners
        for k in range(1, 10):
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[row_idx][start_j + k] = bg
    # Draw middle positions on relative row 2
    mid_row = start_i + 2
    if mid_row < n:
        for k in positions:
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[mid_row][start_j + k] = c
    # Draw bottom bar if possible
    bot_row = start_i + 4
    if bot_row < n:
        for k in range(11):
            if start_j + k < m:
                h[bot_row][start_j + k] = c
```
(This reconstructs each shape correctly once positions are right; helpful, handles boundaries, forces sides to color and clears inners properly; the unconditional bottom draw works for examples but might overdraw if input lacks it.)

(The overall `program` function orchestrates bg identification, detection, position calc, and drawing; solid structure but inherits bugs from `get_middle_positions`.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (c=4,8,2 shapes, bg=1, start_j=1): Mostly correct—detected all shapes, drew frames/sides/inners/bg accurately, middles correct for 4 ([6,8]) and 8 ([2,4,6,8]), top/bottom bars full; but incorrect for 2 at start_i=13 (i%10==3 triggers append(9) in middles, drawing extra 2 at relative k=9/col10 while leaving k=8/col9 as bg, resulting in [...,1 (col9),2 (col10),2 (col11),...] instead of expected [...,2 (col9),1 (col10),2 (col11),...]; this mismatches the partial middle bar for 2 variant.
 * Training example 2: Fully correct (all shapes detected and redrawn matching expected, including middles; no specifics given but implies handled colors/positions well).
 * Training example 3: Fully correct (similar to 2; suggests code handles common cases like c=1,3,4,8 without position dependencies).
 * The i%10==3 condition for c=2 is a subtle attempt to handle position-variant shapes but uses wrong position (9 instead of 8), causing the only mismatch; easy to miss that 2 needs a left-shifted partial middle in certain grid sections.
 * Detection skips (i +=5) works, preventing overlap, but assumes fixed 5-row height—fine for examples but might fail taller/shorter shapes.
 * No unhandled colors in train1, but code defaults to [0,10] for others (only sides, no middles), which could fail new colors.
 * No extraction of individual objects beyond detection; the `detect_shapes` acts as an object extractor, returning list of (i,j,c) tuples—helpful and relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8, shapes for c=2 at i=1, c=4 at i=7, c=3 at i=13, c=1 at i=19, all start_j=1) looks correct overall: detection found all top bars, frames/sides/inners accurate, bottom bars drawn, middles match patterns—c=2 only sides [0,10] since i=1%10!=3 (full bg inners on row3, as shown [8,2,8x8,2,8,...]); c=4 partial [6,8] on row9 ([8,4,8x5,4,8,4,8,4,8,...] with bg at k=7/9); c=3 full dashed [2,4,6,8] like 8 on row15 ([8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,8,...] c at even k, bg at odd k=1,3,5,7,9); c=1 [6,8] since j=1 on row21 ([8,1,8x5,1,8,1,8,1,8,...]).
 * It makes sense and appears to match what a correct output should be, assuming these are standard shape patterns without the position-variant issue from train1 (no c=2 with i%10==3 here, so no bug triggered); patterns resemble stylized digits (e.g., 2 as open top-half, 4 as partial cross, 3/8 as full middle, 1 as right-heavy).
 * However, if the test expected a different variant for c=3 or 1 based on position (e.g., i%10 for 13=3 or 19=9), it might mismatch subtly, but based on code logic and consistency with train2/3, it looks correct—no obvious differences from expected patterns.
 * Extra `bg` rows (e.g., rows 0,6,12,18,24-27 all 8) are properly left as bg, no overdraw.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and reconstruct standardized 5-row-high, 11-column-wide "block" structures (likely representing symbols, letters, or objects) in a grid of integers, using the most common integer as background and filling the output grid with these blocks while clearing everything else to background. The blocks have a fixed skeleton (full top/bottom horizontal bars, vertical sides on middle rows) but vary in the third row (relative row +2) with color-specific middle connections, sometimes modulated by the starting row's position modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all non-block areas in output must be set to this.
 * Blocks must be exactly 11 columns wide and 5 rows high, non-overlapping; detection scans row-by-row, checking for a full horizontal bar of 11 non-background cells at the top, with matching color vertical extensions (only at ends) on the next 3 rows; bottom bar is assumed/inferred.
 * After detecting a block, skip 5 rows in scanning to avoid overlap; if no block found in a potential starting row, advance by 1.
 * Middle row (relative +2) starts with only ends filled (like other middle rows), but then overrides specific positions with the block's color based on `get_middle_positions(c, mod)` where mod = starting_row % 10; this creates unique patterns per color (e.g., no extra for c=2 unless mod=3; dotted evens for c=3; partial for others).
 * Middle rows (+1, +2, +3) explicitly clear inner positions (1-9 relative) to background before adding color-specific overrides on +2 only.
 * Colors like 1,2 depend subtly on mod (e.g., c=1 adds position 8 always, but 6 only if mod=3; c=2 adds 8 only if mod=3); others like 3,4,6,8 are mod-independent.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., test is ~27 rows x 23 cols); blocks may start at column >0 (e.g., col=1 in test); ensure positions don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping or irregularly spaced blocks (but code assumes fixed 5-row spacing); colors not in {1,2,3,4,6,8} (code only handles these for middles, defaults to just ends); vertical alignment assumes exact matches, no partial/torn blocks.
 * Output must fully reconstruct blocks (including bottom bar even if not scanned) and leave all else as background; no partial fills or remnants from input.
 * Subtle: The mod %10 suggests periodic vertical positioning in the puzzle (e.g., every 10 rows affects pattern slightly for some colors), possibly for multi-line text or aligned symbols.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for distinguishing blocks; used in all attempts.)

```python
def get_middle_positions(c: int, mod: int) -> List[int]:
    pos = [0, 10]

        pos += [4, 6, 8]
    elif c == 8:
        pos += [2, 4, 6, 8]
    return pos
```
(This encodes the color-specific (and mod-dependent) middle patterns on relative row +2; critical for unique block rendering; handles known colors, defaults to ends-only for others.)

(The main `program` function integrates detection and rendering; its scanning loop (while i < n-4, inner for j in range(m-10), check full bar + sides) is helpful for locating blocks but assumes perfect input matches—may miss noisy/irregular inputs. No types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) attempt presented; it successfully detects and renders blocks with full top/bottom bars, side extensions, cleared middles, and color-specific overrides on row +2.
 * Worked well: All 3 training examples passed (correct outputs), indicating solid handling of standard block placements, background ID, and pattern rendering for colors like 2,4,3,1.
 * Did not work/missed: No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detection may fail on noisy inputs (e.g., imperfect side matches or non-11 widths) since it requires exact full bars and sides; mod-dependence is hardcoded but only for 1/2—could miss if puzzle has more colors/mods; no extraction of full objects beyond detection (e.g., no function to list all blocks post-scan for verification).
 * The scanning assumes blocks start every 5 rows if found (i +=5), which works for spaced examples but could skip interleaved blocks.
 * Function `identify_background` is essential and correct.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt; all components (detection loop, rendering, middle positions) are relevant, though the rendering hardcodes bottom bar without input verification (potential issue if input lacks it).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: It renders four vertically spaced blocks on background 8 (rows ~1-5 for c=2 with no extra middles since mod=1≠3; rows ~7-11 for c=4 with middles at rel 0,6,8,10; rows ~13-17 for c=3 with middles at rel 0,2,4,6,8,10 forming a dotted pattern; rows ~19-23 for c=1 with middles at rel 0,8,10 since mod=0≠3), each 11 cols wide starting at col=1, with full top/bottom bars, end-only sides on middle rows, and inner clears to 8.
 * All blocks are non-overlapping, gaps are pure background, and patterns match the `get_middle_positions` logic exactly (e.g., no extras or misses in positions; e.g., c=3 row16 has 3's precisely at even relatives).
 * Observed effects: Output grid is fully reconstructed with only detected blocks (no input remnants), dimensions preserved (~27x23), and patterns visually form ladder-like structures with color-coded "rungs" (e.g., sparse for 2/1, denser for 3/4), which aligns with expected symbol rendering; no differences from mental expectation based on code rules—blocks are isolated and clean.
 * No issues noted; it handles the test's multiple blocks and mod variations without errors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numeric colors, where the goal is to detect incomplete or partial "digit-like" shapes (resembling block letters or seven-segment style digits for numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8) that are 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, framed by top and bottom bars and side pillars, with specific middle-row patterns based on the digit's color (c) and vertical position. The program identifies the background color, scans for potential shape locations (requiring a full top bar and empty interiors with optional sides), and reconstructs/completes the shapes in a new grid by drawing full frames, clearing interiors to background, and filling digit-specific positions in the middle row (relative row 2) of the shape, outputting the resulting grid with all detected shapes rendered.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; shapes use non-background colors (c) for their bars and fills.
 * Shapes are exactly 5 rows tall (top bar at row i, sides and middle at i+1 to i+3, bottom at i+4); detection skips 5 rows after finding one to avoid overlap, but increments by 1 if not found.
 * Detection requires: a full 11-cell top bar of uniform c != bg; for relative rows 1-3: interiors (columns j+1 to j+9) must be exactly bg (no other colors allowed); sides (j and j+10) must be either c or bg (allows partial/missing sides, but rejects if another color).
 * No explicit check for bottom bar in detection—it's assumed and drawn during reconstruction; this could miss shapes without bottoms but complete them anyway.
 * Middle fills occur only on relative row 2 (i+2), at specific column offsets (k values from 0 to 10) determined by c and start_row % 10 (modulo 10 for vertical variation, e.g., extra fills for certain mods like 3 for c=1 or 2).
 * For c=1: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (single middle-right stem for '1').
 * For c=2: base [0,10] + [8] if mod==3 (minimal middle for '2', optional right fill based on position).
 * For c=3: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (dotted/even-offset fills across middle for '3', like spaced horizontal bar).
 * For c=4: [0,6,8,10] (right-heavy fills for '4', like partial crossbar).
 * For c=6: [0,4,6,8,10] (left-middle to right fills for '6').
 * For c=8: [0,2,4,6,8,10] (full even-offset fills for '8', like solid middle bar).
 * Offsets are relative to start_j; drawing respects grid bounds (n rows, m columns) but doesn't handle overlaps (assumes non-overlapping shapes).
 * Grid may have multiple shapes stacked vertically with blank (bg) rows separating them; wide grids (e.g., m=23) have shapes starting at j=1, with bg padding.
 * Subtle: Middle fills overwrite the prior bg clear, but sides (0 and 10) are redundantly filled (already set to c); no fills for k=1,3,5,7,9 in most cases, creating open interiors except specifics.
 * Detection starts scanning from i=0, checks every j in 0 to m-11, but only advances i by 5 on find (greedy, may miss adjacent if not exact).
 * No handling for c=0,5,7,9 or other colors—only predefined c values get middle patterns; unknown c defaults to just sides [0,10].
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; shapes near bottom may lack bottom bar if i+4 >=n; horizontal padding (e.g., shapes not at j=0).
 * Potential misses: Shapes without full top bar won't be detected; if sides have wrong color (not c or bg), rejected; interiors with non-bg block detection.
 * Vertical position (mod 10) adds variation—e.g., a '2' at row mod 3 gets extra k=8 fill, simulating style changes or anti-repetition in puzzle.

(Reconstructs shape: full top/bottom bars, forced sides, cleared interiors, selective middle fills; bounds-checked; modifies h in-place.)

```python

    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = identify_background(g)
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    h = [[bg for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    shapes = detect_shapes(g, bg)
    for start_i, start_j, c in shapes:
        positions = get_middle_positions(c, start_i)
        draw_shape(h, start_i, start_j, c, positions, bg, n, m)
    return h
```
(Orchestrates: bg id, init blank h, detect, draw all; simple and works for non-overlapping cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it succeeded on all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic shape detection and reconstruction for predefined digits.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential issues include: greedy i +=5 may skip shapes if not perfectly aligned; no overlap resolution if shapes overlap; unhandled c values default to minimal [0,10] (may misrender unknown digits); detection tolerant of missing sides but requires perfect top bar and empty interiors—could fail if top is partial or interiors have noise.
 * Function detect_shapes is essential for locating partial shapes and essential to the solution.
 * Function get_middle_positions captures digit-specific and position-variant patterns, crucial for subtleties like mod-10 extras.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and functional; draw_shape is helpful but could be extended for bottom detection if needed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and makes sense: it renders four stacked shapes (likely digits 2 at ~row1, 4 at ~row7, 3 at ~row13, 1 at ~row19) on bg=8 in a 27x23 grid (inferred from lists), with full top/bottom bars of c, sides forced to c, interiors cleared to 8 except digit-specific middle-row fills on relative row 2.
 * For '2' (c=2, start_i~1, mod=1 !=3): middle row only sides (cols 1,11 filled 2; matches minimal pattern, no extra k=8).
 * For '4' (c=4, start_i~7, mod=7): middle row fills k=[0,6,8,10] → cols 1,7,9,11 as 4 (right-heavy, like '4' cross; col10=8 correctly unfilled; observed: 4 at 1,7,9,11 with 8 elsewhere in interior—exact match to expected).
 * For '3' (c=3, start_i~13, mod=3): middle row fills k=[0,2,4,6,8,10] → cols 1,3,5,7,9,11 as 3 (dotted full-width middle; observed: 3 at every other col starting 1—matches, no gaps in pattern).
 * For '1' (c=1, start_i~19, mod=9 !=3): middle row fills k=[0,8,10] → cols 1,9,11 as 1 (right stem; observed: 1 at 1,9,11 with col10=8—exact match).
 * Separators are all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,12,18,24-26); no overlaps or artifacts; bottom bars drawn fully; padding cols 0 and 12+ are 8. This aligns with puzzle rules for completing partial shapes into consistent digit renders— no differences from expected (assuming input had partials detected at those positions); if input lacked some sides/bottoms, they are correctly added.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a larger image or display) with a background color (8) and foreground shapes composed of horizontal and vertical bars using different colors (1,2,3,4, etc., possibly representing digits or symbols). The program's goal is to detect these 5-row-high bar-based shapes in the input grid `g`, identify their color `c` and position, and reconstruct a new grid `h` by redrawing the shapes with specific middle bar connections added or cleared based on rules tied to `c` and the shape's starting row modulo 10, while filling the rest with background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows high: top full horizontal bar (11 consecutive cells of `c`), 3 middle rows with only vertical sides at relative positions 0 and 10 (must be `c` or background, but inners 1-9 must be strictly background—no other colors allowed), and a bottom full horizontal bar at row +4 (though detection doesn't verify the bottom bar exists, it assumes and draws it).
 * Detection scans row-by-row for top bars, but skips 5 rows after finding one to avoid overlapping detections; it allows side positions to be background (which could falsely detect incomplete shapes) and doesn't check for the bottom bar or any middle connections during detection—middles are added post-detection based on rules.
 * Middle connections are drawn only on the relative row +2 (third row of the shape), using positions from `get_middle_positions` that depend on `c` (e.g., 3 gets dense [2,4,6,8]; 1 gets sparse [8], optionally +6; 2 gets minimal or none) and modulated by `start_row % 10` (e.g., mod==3 adds extras for some `c` like 1 or 2)—this suggests position-dependent stylization, perhaps for a scrolling or modular display puzzle where row position affects rendering.
 * Drawing overwrites the new grid `h` (initialized to background) with `c` for bars/sides/middles, explicitly clears inner positions (1-9 relative) to background on middle rows (even if they were something else), and draws the bottom bar unconditionally (potentially adding missing bottoms).
 * Grid bounds are handled (e.g., no drawing if out of bounds), but assumes uniform row length `m`; shapes are 11 cells wide (relative 0-10), but observed outputs show 12 cells filled, suggesting possible off-by-one in slicing or indexing (e.g., j to j+11).
 * Background identification uses simple mode (most common value); assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.
 * Subtlety: No handling for overlapping shapes, multiple shapes per row, or non-bar artifacts—detection is greedy and vertical-only. Colors like 6 and 8 have defined middles but aren't in test; undefined `c` (e.g., 5,7) would fail silently with empty positions. Row mod 10 implies a 10-row repeating pattern, easy to miss if not considering positional variance.
 * Considerations from logic: Input likely has clean shapes (solid sides, empty middles, full top/bottom), but program could "fix" incomplete ones by adding middles/bottoms; if puzzle requires exact reproduction without additions, this over-draws.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided submission; it succeeded on all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic shape detection and drawing for those cases (likely similar stacked or isolated bar shapes).
 * Worked well for detecting tops and validating middle rows, adding position-dependent middles without over-drawing extras where not needed (e.g., no mod==3 triggers in training?).
 * Potential issue: Width seems 12 cells in outputs (col 1-12 filled) vs. code's 11 (j to j+10); this off-by-one worked for training but could be fragile—unknown if training inputs matched exactly or if slicing compensates.
 * Detection's allowance of bg on sides worked for training but might miss requiring solid `c` sides; no overlaps or edge cases in training.
 * `get_middle_positions` is essential and correctly applied (e.g., sparse for 1/2, dense for 3/4/6/8); mod 10 rule likely key for training variance.
 * Drawing clears inners explicitly, which is helpful to "clean" any noise, but if inputs are already clean, it's redundant—worked fine.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all components (background ID, detection, positions, drawing) are relevant and integrated well. No broken elements noted, but bottom bar is drawn without input verification, which succeeded in training (assuming all shapes complete).

**Test output:**
 * The test output reconstructs a 27-row x 23-col grid with background 8 and four vertically stacked shapes (c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), separated by single empty rows (6,12,18,24-26 all 8s); this matches expected detection logic (skipping 5 rows post-find, starting at i=1,7,13,19 assuming 0-indexed input with top bars there).
 * For c=2 (start_i=1, mod=1 !=3): top/bottom full (col1-12=2), sides only on rows2-4 (col1+12=2, inners 8), no extra middles on row3—looks correct, reproduces a minimal '2'-like shape without additions.
 * For c=4 (start_i=7, mod=7): similar full bars/sides, but middles on row9 at relative 6+8 (col7+9=4, plus sides col1+11)—matches [8,4,8s,8,4,8,4,8,4,8s pattern; looks correct for a '4' with crossbar stubs.
 * For c=3 (start_i=13, mod=3): full bars/sides, middles on row15 at [0,2,4,6,8,10] relative (col1,3,5,7,9,11=3, evens 8)—matches every-other-column pattern; looks correct for a dense '3' or 'E'-like.
 * For c=1 (start_i=19, mod=9 !=3): full bars/sides, middles on row21 at [0,8,10] relative (col1,9,11=1)—matches sparse [8,1,8s x7,1,8,1,8...]; looks correct for a '1' with hook.
 * Overall, test output makes sense and appears correct: it faithfully redraws detected shapes with rule-based middles, cleaning inners to 8; width (12 cells) is consistent but possibly off-by-one from code's 11 (e.g., j+11 filled?), but patterns align perfectly with logic—no extras, no misses, and mod 10 didn't trigger additions here. If expected is exact input copy, this matches assuming clean input; if puzzle requires no additions (e.g., copy without mod-based fills), it's still close but potentially over-interprets middles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:56:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a grid `g` by identifying the background color, detecting specific 5-row-high by 11-column-wide shapes defined by a uniform non-background color `c`, and redrawing those shapes in a new grid `h` filled with the background, using predefined patterns for top/bottom bars, sides, interior clearing, and middle bars that vary by `c` and sometimes by the starting row index modulo 10.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes consist of a full top bar (11 consecutive cells of `c` in row `start_i`), vertical sides (at relative columns 0 and 10) in relative rows 1-3, cleared interior (background in relative columns 1-9 for relative rows 1-3), a middle bar in relative row 2 (or sometimes relative row 3 based on examples), and a full bottom bar in relative row 4; the middle bar positions always include 0 and 10 (sides), plus additional positions depending on `c` and `start_i % 10`.
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; shapes do not overlap in the examples, but are separated by at least one full background row.
 * Detection scans for full top bars of 11 identical non-bg cells, then validates the next 3 rows have background interiors and sides that are either `c` or bg (allowing partial sides, but examples have full sides); advances row index by 5 on detection to skip the shape height, or by 1 otherwise— this may miss shapes if they are closer than 5 rows apart.
 * Middle bar positions are `c`-specific: e.g., full dense for 3/8 ([0,2,4,6,8,10]), sparser for 4/6 ([0,6,8,10] in code, but 6 needs [0,4,6,8,10] per example); for 1, base [0,8,10], adds [4,6] if `start_i % 10 == 3` (but example shows [0,6,8,10] instead, and at relative row 3 not 2); for 2, base [0,10], adds [8] if mod==3 (examples have no extras when mod!=3).
 * Subtle: Middle bar row is always relative 2 in code, but training 3 expected for c=1 (mod=3) places extras at relative 3 with adjusted positions [0,6,8,10] (not code's [0,4,6,8,10] at relative 2); this suggests position-dependent or `c`/mod rules for both positions and row offset, possibly for "low" vs "high" rendering in a larger display (e.g., mod 3 triggers shifted pattern).
 * Interiors must be strictly bg in detection/validation, but redrawing clears them to bg even if input had noise.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 20-28 rows, 23 columns in examples); output `h` initializes to full bg and only draws detected shapes, ignoring other content.
 * Easy to miss: `c` determines shape variant (e.g., 6 needs extra middle position vs 4); mod 10 affects only some `c` (1 and 2), possibly for periodic layout like multi-digit numbers; detection may fail if top bar is not exactly 11 consecutive or if sides are missing in input.
 * No overlapping shapes in examples, but i +=5 skip assumes no overlap; shapes start at various column j (e.g., j=1 or 2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Correctly identifies bg as most common color using Counter; works in all examples.
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return collections.Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def detect_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # Detects shape starts by scanning for top bars and validating structure; works for non-overlapping cases but advances i+=5, which is fine here.
    # Note: Allows sides to be bg (not strictly c), which may be too lenient if input has noise, but matches examples.
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    m = len(g[0])
    shapes = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 3:
        found = False
        for j in range(m - 10):
            row_slice = g[i][j:j + 11]
            if len(set(row_slice)) == 1 and row_slice[0] != bg:
                c = row_slice[0]

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; training 1 passed fully (correct detection, drawing, and patterns for whatever shapes were there).
 * Training 2 incorrect: For c=6 middle row, generated has 6 at relative positions 0,6,8,10 (missing 4, so only 4 spots instead of expected 5: 0,4,6,8,10); c=1 (mod!=3) and c=4 correct (positions [0,8,10] and [0,6,8,10] match expected at relative row 2).
 * Training 3 incorrect: For c=1 (mod=3, start_i likely 13), generated places extras at relative row 3 with positions [0,6,8,10] (4 spots: col 1,7,9,11), but expected is the same—wait, listed outputs match exactly for all rows/shapes (2,4,1 all match expected patterns, sides cleared, bars full); possible subtle unlisted difference (e.g., one cell not cleared or bounds issue) or error in provided output, but marked incorrect so assume minor detection/drawing mismatch like extra bg or uncled cell in interiors; c=2 and c=4 correct (no extras for 2, sparse for 4 at row 2).
 * detect_shapes essential for locating shapes but may be too aggressive on i+=5 skip if shapes close; works for separated examples.
 * get_middle_positions broken for c=6 (missing rel 4) and c=1 mod=3 (wrong positions and row offset needed); partially helpful but needs fix for all c/mod combos.
 * draw_shape helpful for structure but inflexible on middle row (always +2, needs conditional +2 or +3 based on mod/c).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant but incomplete (no overlap handling, no full pattern table for middles).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and makes sense based on current logic: it detects and draws four separated shapes on bg=8 (2 at rows 1-5 cols1-11 with no middle extras since mod=1!=3; 4 at 7-11 with [0,6,8,10] at rel2 row9; 3 at 13-17 with full [0,2,4,6,8,10] at rel2 row15; 1 at 20-24 with [0,8,10] at rel2 row22 since mod=0!=3), interiors cleared, no overlaps, empty rows preserved as bg.
 * However, it may not be fully correct if the puzzle requires mod-dependent row offsets (e.g., middle at +3 for some) or adjusted positions (e.g., if test has c=6, it would miss rel4 like training 2; if a c=1 with mod=3, it would draw wrong positions/row like training 3); the patterns resemble 7-segment digits (2=curved top/bottom, 4=half middle, 3=full middle, 1=serif base), so test likely intends similar, but code's limitations (e.g., no +3 row) could mismatch if test has "shifted" shapes.
 * Overall plausible for non-mod3/special c cases, but likely incorrect for edge cases like training 2/3 failures; to fix, update get_middle_positions with full table (e.g., dict[c][mod] -> (positions, rel_row_offset)) and modify draw_shape to use offset for middle row.
