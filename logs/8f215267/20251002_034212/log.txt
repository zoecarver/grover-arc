=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:42:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:01:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (8) and incomplete table-like structures in different colors (1, 2, 3, 4), where each structure consists of a top horizontal bar of 11 consecutive cells, at least 3 vertical legs (pairs of colored cells at the ends with background in between), an optional bottom bar, and a crossbar that needs to be completed in the middle leg row. The program's task is to detect these structures in the input grid and output a new grid with the structures fully drawn, including adding the color-specific crossbar segments on the right side of the middle leg, while filling the rest with background and avoiding overlaps via a visited mechanism.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must start with exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c != background in a row, checked via is_full; shorter or longer bars are ignored.
 * Legs are detected downward from the top bar, requiring exactly two c cells at positions l and l+10 with all background (bg) strictly between (l+1 to l+9); if any non-bg appears between, it's not a valid leg (this ensures input legs are "clean" without premature crossbars).
 * At least 3 consecutive valid legs are required to process a structure; fewer are skipped.
 * Bottom bar is preferably detected as a full 11-cell bar exactly one row below the last leg (s + num_leg + 1); if not present or out of bounds, default to s + 4 (though not used in this test).
 * Crossbar is always drawn in the middle leg row (s + 1 + (num_leg // 2)), starting with the leg endpoints (l and l+10), then adding k-1 additional cells inward from the right endpoint at even steps (l+10 - 2*p for p=0 to k-1), creating a right-aligned "cross" pattern (e.g., for k=3: cells at l+10, l+8, l+6; left leg at l remains isolated).
 * Crossbar width k is color- and position-dependent via get_k: c=1 uses 4 - l (e.g., 3 for l=1, adding cells at positions 11,9,7 relative to l=1); c=2 uses 1 if starting row s==1 (minimal, no extras) else 2; c>=3 uses c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3 adding at 11,9; 3 for c=4 adding at 11,9,7).
 * All drawing overwrites to c only for top/bottom (full 11 cells), legs (just endpoints), and crossbar (endpoints + extras); the output grid starts as all bg, so it reconstructs structures without copying extraneous input cells.
 * Process rows from top to bottom (s loop), skipping visited rows to prevent reprocessing overlaps; marks all rows from top to bottom (inclusive) as visited after drawing.
 * Subtlety: get_k's special case for c=2 depending on s==1 assumes position-specific rules (e.g., topmost structure gets minimal cross); this works for training but may fail if 2 appears elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: Structures are exactly 11 cells wide (l to l+10), starting at various l but fixed width; no rotation, vertical, or irregular shapes.
 * Subtlety: Input may have "clean" legs (bg between) but the program adds the crossbar, implying the puzzle is to complete/infer the cross; if input already has cross-like non-bg between legs, detection fails (is_leg returns False), skipping the structure.
 * All structures in test start at l=1, but code handles general l; background uniform from g[0][0].
 * No handling for isolated bars, fewer than 3 legs, or non-horizontal elements; assumes no overlapping structures (visited prevents but may miss interleaved ones).
 * Grid size: n rows, m=23 columns in test; l < m-10 to fit 11 cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color, essential for distinguishing structures and checking legs.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    return all(row[k] == c for k in range(l, l + 10))  # Note: range(l, l+11) would be correct for 11 cells; current is l to l+9 (10 cells)—potential off-by-one bug, but works if input matches.
```
(Checks for full horizontal bar of exactly 11 cells; critical for tops/bottoms; subtle off-by-one in range may cause issues for edge cases.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, bg: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[l + 10] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, l + 10):  # Checks l+1 to l+9 (9 cells); assumes input has bg here for valid leg.
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Key for detecting clean legs; strict bg requirement between endpoints ensures no premature crossbars in input.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar width; essential for color-specific completion; s-dependency for c=2 is position-aware but brittle if 2 moves.)

The main program function integrates these to detect, count legs, draw components, and mark visited rows; no types like classes needed, but could add a Structure dataclass for top/l/legs/bottom/k if refactoring.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it successfully passed all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection of full bars, legs, and crossbar drawing works for those cases.
 * Likely handled training structures with clean legs and position-specific k values (e.g., c=2 at s=1 getting k=1).
 * Potential missed subtlety: range in is_full is to l+10 (10 cells), but 11 needed (should be l+11); may coincidentally work if inputs align but risks missing 1-cell shorts.
 * get_k's s==1 for c=2 assumes fixed positioning; if training had 2 only at top, it passed, but generalizes poorly.
 * Visited marking from s to bottom inclusive prevents overlaps effectively in vertical stacking (as in test).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_full, is_leg, get_k) are relevant and core to detection/drawing—no broken ones noted, though is_full range is subtly imprecise.
 * No extraction of full objects attempted; code processes inline without storing structures, which works but could miss if needing to validate post-draw.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct based on puzzle rules: it reconstructs 4 stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23) with tops/bottoms as full 11-cell bars (cols 1-11), legs as endpoints only (cols 1 and 11), and crossbars added only in middle leg rows with color-specific widths—no extras for c=2 (k=1, row 3: just cols 1/11), one extra for c=3 (k=2, row 15: cols 1/9/11), two extras for c=4 and c=1 (k=3, rows 9/21: cols 1/7/9/11), all on bg elsewhere with no overlaps.
 * Expected: Input likely had clean outlines (full tops/bottoms, legs with bg between, no crossbars), and program completed crosses correctly without copying input extras; output isolates right-aligned cross patterns (e.g., no full horizontal cross, just stepped right-side fills + left leg).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Crossbars are not symmetric/full (e.g., gap between left leg at col 1 and right cross starting at col 7/9/11); this matches code but may be a subtlety— if puzzle expects connected/full bars, it's incorrect (unknown without true output, but consistent with training success).
 * For c=2, no change beyond legs (correct per k=1 and s=1); for others, added cells (e.g., row 9 cols 7/9 filled from bg to 4) complete the pattern without over-drawing.
 * All rows between structures (e.g., 0/6/12/18/24-26) are pure bg (8), and post-23 rows untouched; no artifacts or skips.
 * Overall, output demonstrates understanding: detects all 4 structures (num_leg=3 each), draws precisely, handles varying k; looks correct assuming puzzle goal is right-aligned cross completion.

[2025-10-02 04:01:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:12:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with background cells and incomplete "balloon" or "blob" shapes made of colored cells (non-background). The goal is to detect specific 5-row high patterns (full horizontal span at top and bottom, thin vertical connections on the sides in the three middle rows) and complete them by filling a patterned interior in the central middle row (row start+2) using a color-specific pattern, then remove any remaining small connected components (size <20) that aren't part of valid completed shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows tall: a starting row with a horizontal span of >=10 consecutive cells of the same color (non-bg), a bottom row (start+4) that is fully filled with that color across the exact same span (no gaps, sides must align), and three middle rows (start+1 to start+3) that are "thin" (only the leftmost and rightmost cells of the span are the shape's color, with all interior cells strictly background; no extra colors or protrusions inside or outside the span in those rows).
 * Filling happens only in the exact central middle row (start+2), using a stepped pattern (every 2 cells starting from a color-specific offset within the span); the pattern must not overwrite existing side cells but adds interior ones. Different colors have unique offsets and patterns (e.g., color 8: dense alternating fill starting from left; color 4: sparser fill starting ~6 cells from left, adding 3 interior cells at positions like 7,9,11 for span 1-11; color 2: even sparser, starting ~8 from left, adding 2 interior cells like 9,11; color 1 similar to 4 but sometimes skips some positions; color 6: alternating but denser than 4, starting earlier). Over-filling (e.g., adding extra cells not in expected) breaks the pattern.
 * A key condition is that fewer than 3 of the middle rows can have "interfering" elements outside the span (i.e., cells that are non-bg and not the shape's color); if >=3 middle rows have such interference (e.g., parts of other shapes), don't fill to avoid corrupting adjacent objects. Shapes must not overlap or interfere horizontally in middle rows.
 * Background is always the most common cell value across the entire grid (via flat count); assume rectangular grid, all rows same width.
 * After all fills, perform 4-way connected flood-fill (up/down/left/right, same color only) to identify components and erase any with total size <20 cells (prevents noise or incomplete partials from remaining, but completed shapes are large enough ~28+ cells even unfilled due to connections, larger after fill).
 * Subtle: Spans must be exact matches top-to-bottom (same left/right positions); multiple shapes per grid, separated by bg; detection scans from top (start_row 0 to h-5); input likely has outlines already (full top/bottom + side stubs in middles), but fill only adds interior pattern if all conditions met—missing sides in input would fail "thin" check. Easy to miss: vertical connectivity makes unfilled shapes survive size check (~28 cells via top bar + bottom bar + 6 side cells); patterns are asymmetric or offset per color, not uniform; removal happens post-all-fills on a copy to avoid interfering with detection.
 * Grids are ~23x23, but generalize; no diagonal connections; only horizontal spans trigger (no vertical or diagonal patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg as most common value, essential for all checks.)

```python
def find_span(row: List[int], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int] | None:
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            length = i - start
            if length >= 10:
                return color, start, i - 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return None
```
(Helpful: Finds the first horizontal run of >=10 non-bg cells in a row, returns color + exact left/right bounds; critical for span detection, but assumes only one qualifying span per row—may miss if multiples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Verifies exact span is solidly filled with color, no bg or other intrusions; key for bottom row check.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= w:
        return False
    if row[left] != color or row[right] != color:
        return False
    for k in range(left + 1, right):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Confirms "thin neck" structure—sides present, interior strictly bg; essential for all three middle rows, fails if sides missing or interior cluttered.)

```python
def has_other_in_row(row: List[int], color: int, bg: int, left: int, right: int, w: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(w):
        if left <= k <= right:
            continue
        if row[k] != bg and row[k] != color:
            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful: Detects interference outside span in a row (non-bg, non-shape-color cells); used to count per middle row, ensures <3 rows affected before filling.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))
    size = 1
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(Helpful: 4-way flood-fill to compute connected component size and cells for a starting cell/color; crucial for post-process removal of small blobs <20; returns size and set of positions for targeted erasure.)

The `fill_row` function from the attempt is partially helpful (applies stepped pattern based on color) but broken in offsets/steps for some colors (e.g., overfills for color=1, underfills/skips for color=6; returns early for unknown colors, preventing any fill).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it demonstrates partial understanding: correctly detects bg, scans for 5-row structures via span/full/thin checks, applies color-specific stepped fills in middle row, and removes small components post-fill.
 * Worked: Structure detection logic (span >=10, exact bottom full, all middle thin, interference <3 rows) is solid in concept; removal via flood-fill correctly preserves large connected shapes (e.g., unfilled balloon ~28 cells via top/bottom bars + sides survives >20 threshold); patterns match exactly for some cases (e.g., train2 color=4 adds correct 8,10,12; train1 color=8 alternating if triggered; train1 color=4 adds 7,9,11 matching expected).
 * Didn't work: Fill never triggers in any training output (generated matches input outlines exactly—no interior patterns added), likely due to implementation bug (e.g., is_thin fails silently if input middles lack sides, but generated shows sides present, suggesting input already has outlines and detection skips for unknown reason like span bounds mismatch or loop indexing error); for train1, expected adds patterns to row3 (4's: +7,9,11), row9 (8's: alternating 1,3,5,7,9,11), row16 (2's: +9,11), but generated has only sides everywhere; for train2, expected adds to row4 (1's: +10,12 but code would wrongly add 8,10,12), row10 (6's: alternating 2,6,8,10,12 but code skips entirely via else return), row16 (4's: +8,10,12 matching but not added), generated only sides; for train3, expected adds denser patterns (4's row9: +5,7,9,11 but code only +7,9,11 missing 5; 1's row15: +5,7,9,11 but code +7,9,11 missing 5; 2's no fill needed, matches generated), but generated only sides (no adds anywhere); subtle: code's offsets (e.g., +6 for 1/4, +8 for 2, 0 for 8) are close but incomplete/wrong for 1/6 (needs adjustment like +4 or different step for density); num_with_other <3 prevents false positives but may over-block if minor interference.
 * Missed: Handling all colors (e.g., no pattern for 6, partial for 1/2/4 across examples); potential bug in triggering fill (e.g., range(h-4) misses lower shapes if h small; assumes first span only, may skip if multiple); doesn't add missing sides if input lacks them (but generated suggests input has them).
 * extract_objects not present, but compute_component_size serves as essential tool for post-removal (would be useful pre-process to isolate shapes).
 * fill_row is partially helpful for patterned fill but broken/not general (hardcoded offsets fail for train3 4's/1's by missing positions like +5; skips unknown colors; step=2 too rigid—some patterns may need step=1 or variable).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it replicates the input outlines (full top/bottom spans + thin sides in all three middle rows for each of four shapes: 2's rows1-5, 4's rows7-11, 3's rows13-17, 1's rows19-23) with no interior fills added, similar to all training generated outputs; based on training expecteds, it should add color-specific patterns to the central middle row (start+2) for each shape if conditions met (e.g., for 2's row3: add ~9,11 as in train1; for 4's row9: add ~7,9,11 or denser per train3; for 3's row15: unknown pattern but likely some interior like others; for 1's row21: add ~7,9,11 or denser). No small components removed (but none qualify as shapes are connected >20 even unfilled). This suggests same trigger failure as training (no changes), making output incomplete—expected would have patterned interiors (e.g., sparse dots/clusters per color) while preserving outlines and bg=8 elsewhere; without fills, shapes remain "incomplete" per puzzle rules. Do not look correct because they ignore the core completion step, leaving all shapes as mere outlines (mismatches all training expecteds' patterned bodies); to handle test, must fix trigger (e.g., verify input has sides, adjust offsets for 3/1 if similar to 4), ensure patterns match example densities (e.g., test 3's may need custom like alternating or +4 offset).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with background cells and incomplete "balloon" or "blob" shapes made of colored cells (non-background). The goal is to detect specific 5-row high patterns (full horizontal span at top and bottom, thin vertical connections on the sides in the three middle rows) and complete them by filling a patterned interior in the central middle row (row start+2) using a color-specific pattern, then remove any remaining small connected components (size <20) that aren't part of valid completed shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows tall: a starting row with a horizontal span of >=10 consecutive cells of the same color (non-bg), a bottom row (start+4) that is fully filled with that color across the exact same span (no gaps, sides must align), and three middle rows (start+1 to start+3) that are "thin" (only the leftmost and rightmost cells of the span are the shape's color, with all interior cells strictly background; no extra colors or protrusions inside or outside the span in those rows).
 * Filling happens only in the exact central middle row (start+2), using a stepped pattern (every 2 cells starting from a color-specific offset within the span); the pattern must not overwrite existing side cells but adds interior ones. Different colors have unique offsets and patterns (e.g., color 8: dense alternating fill starting from left; color 4: sparser fill starting ~6 cells from left, adding 3 interior cells at positions like 7,9,11 for span 1-11; color 2: even sparser, starting ~8 from left, adding 2 interior cells like 9,11; color 1 similar to 4 but sometimes skips some positions; color 6: alternating but denser than 4, starting earlier). Over-filling (e.g., adding extra cells not in expected) breaks the pattern.
 * A key condition is that fewer than 3 of the middle rows can have "interfering" elements outside the span (i.e., cells that are non-bg and not the shape's color); if >=3 middle rows have such interference (e.g., parts of other shapes), don't fill to avoid corrupting adjacent objects. Shapes must not overlap or interfere horizontally in middle rows.
 * Background is always the most common cell value across the entire grid (via flat count); assume rectangular grid, all rows same width.
 * After all fills, perform 4-way connected flood-fill (up/down/left/right, same color only) to identify components and erase any with total size <20 cells (prevents noise or incomplete partials from remaining, but completed shapes are large enough ~28+ cells even unfilled due to connections, larger after fill).
 * Subtle: Spans must be exact matches top-to-bottom (same left/right positions); multiple shapes per grid, separated by bg; detection scans from top (start_row 0 to h-5); input likely has outlines already (full top/bottom + side stubs in middles), but fill only adds interior pattern if all conditions met—missing sides in input would fail "thin" check. Easy to miss: vertical connectivity makes unfilled shapes survive size check (~28 cells via top bar + bottom bar + 6 side cells); patterns are asymmetric or offset per color, not uniform; removal happens post-all-fills on a copy to avoid interfering with detection.
 * Grids are ~23x23, but generalize; no diagonal connections; only horizontal spans trigger (no vertical or diagonal patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg as most common value, essential for all checks.)

```python
def find_span(row: List[int], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int] | None:
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            length = i - start
            if length >= 10:
                return color, start, i - 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return None
```
(Helpful: Finds the first horizontal run of >=10 non-bg cells in a row, returns color + exact left/right bounds; critical for span detection, but assumes only one qualifying span per row—may miss if multiples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Verifies exact span is solidly filled with color, no bg or other intrusions; key for bottom row check.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= w:
        return False
    if row[left] != color or row[right] != color:
        return False
    for k in range(left + 1, right):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Confirms "thin neck" structure—sides present, interior strictly bg; essential for all three middle rows, fails if sides missing or interior cluttered.)

```python
def has_other_in_row(row: List[int], color: int, bg: int, left: int, right: int, w: int) -> bool:

            continue
        if row[k] != bg and row[k] != color:
            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful: Detects interference outside span in a row (non-bg, non-shape-color cells); used to count per middle row, ensures <3 rows affected before filling.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))

    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()

            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(Helpful: 4-way flood-fill to compute connected component size and cells for a starting cell/color; crucial for post-process removal of small blobs <20; returns size and set of positions for targeted erasure.)

The `fill_row` function from the attempt is partially helpful (applies stepped pattern based on color) but broken in offsets/steps for some colors (e.g., overfills for color=1, underfills/skips for color=6; returns early for unknown colors, preventing any fill).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it demonstrates partial understanding: correctly detects bg, scans for 5-row structures via span/full/thin checks, applies color-specific stepped fills in middle row, and removes small components post-fill.
 * Worked: Structure detection logic (span >=10, exact bottom full, all middle thin, interference <3 rows) is solid in concept; removal via flood-fill correctly preserves large connected shapes (e.g., unfilled balloon ~28 cells via top/bottom bars + sides survives >20 threshold); patterns match exactly for some cases (e.g., train2 color=4 adds correct 8,10,12; train1 color=8 alternating if triggered; train1 color=4 adds 7,9,11 matching expected).
 * Didn't work: Fill never triggers in any training output (generated matches input outlines exactly—no interior patterns added), likely due to implementation bug (e.g., is_thin fails silently if input middles lack sides, but generated shows sides present, suggesting input already has outlines and detection skips for unknown reason like span bounds mismatch or loop indexing error); for train1, expected adds patterns to row3 (4's: +7,9,11), row9 (8's: alternating 1,3,5,7,9,11), row16 (2's: +9,11), but generated has only sides everywhere; for train2, expected adds to row4 (1's: +10,12 but code would wrongly add 8,10,12), row10 (6's: alternating 2,6,8,10,12 but code skips entirely via else return), row16 (4's: +8,10,12 matching but not added), generated only sides; for train3, expected adds denser patterns (4's row9: +5,7,9,11 but code only +7,9,11 missing 5; 1's row15: +5,7,9,11 but code +7,9,11 missing 5; 2's no fill needed, matches generated), but generated only sides (no adds anywhere); subtle: code's offsets (e.g., +6 for 1/4, +8 for 2, 0 for 8) are close but incomplete/wrong for 1/6 (needs adjustment like +4 or different step for density); num_with_other <3 prevents false positives but may over-block if minor interference.
 * Missed: Handling all colors (e.g., no pattern for 6, partial for 1/2/4 across examples); potential bug in triggering fill (e.g., range(h-4) misses lower shapes if h small; assumes first span only, may skip if multiple); doesn't add missing sides if input lacks them (but generated suggests input has them).
 * extract_objects not present, but compute_component_size serves as essential tool for post-removal (would be useful pre-process to isolate shapes).
 * fill_row is partially helpful for patterned fill but broken/not general (hardcoded offsets fail for train3 4's/1's by missing positions like +5; skips unknown colors; step=2 too rigid—some patterns may need step=1 or variable).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it replicates the input outlines (full top/bottom spans + thin sides in all three middle rows for each of four shapes: 2's rows1-5, 4's rows7-11, 3's rows13-17, 1's rows19-23) with no interior fills added, similar to all training generated outputs; based on training expecteds, it should add color-specific patterns to the central middle row (start+2) for each shape if conditions met (e.g., for 2's row3: add ~9,11 as in train1; for 4's row9: add ~7,9,11 or denser per train3; for 3's row15: unknown pattern but likely some interior like others; for 1's row21: add ~7,9,11 or denser). No small components removed (but none qualify as shapes are connected >20 even unfilled). This suggests same trigger failure as training (no changes), making output incomplete—expected would have patterned interiors (e.g., sparse dots/clusters per color) while preserving outlines and bg=8 elsewhere; without fills, shapes remain "incomplete" per puzzle rules. Do not look correct because they ignore the core completion step, leaving all shapes as mere outlines (mismatches all training expecteds' patterned bodies); to handle test, must fix trigger (e.g., verify input has sides, adjust offsets for 3/1 if similar to 4), ensure patterns match example densities (e.g., test 3's may need custom like alternating or +4 offset).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (8) and incomplete table-like structures in different colors (1, 2, 3, 4), where each structure consists of a top horizontal bar of 11 consecutive cells, at least 3 vertical legs (pairs of colored cells at the ends with background in between), an optional bottom bar, and a crossbar that needs to be completed in the middle leg row. The program's task is to detect these structures in the input grid and output a new grid with the structures fully drawn, including adding the color-specific crossbar segments on the right side of the middle leg, while filling the rest with background and avoiding overlaps via a visited mechanism.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must start with exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c != background in a row, checked via is_full; shorter or longer bars are ignored.
 * Legs are detected downward from the top bar, requiring exactly two c cells at positions l and l+10 with all background (bg) strictly between (l+1 to l+9); if any non-bg appears between, it's not a valid leg (this ensures input legs are "clean" without premature crossbars).
 * At least 3 consecutive valid legs are required to process a structure; fewer are skipped.
 * Bottom bar is preferably detected as a full 11-cell bar exactly one row below the last leg (s + num_leg + 1); if not present or out of bounds, default to s + 4 (though not used in this test).
 * Crossbar is always drawn in the middle leg row (s + 1 + (num_leg // 2)), starting with the leg endpoints (l and l+10), then adding k-1 additional cells inward from the right endpoint at even steps (l+10 - 2*p for p=0 to k-1), creating a right-aligned "cross" pattern (e.g., for k=3: cells at l+10, l+8, l+6; left leg at l remains isolated).
 * Crossbar width k is color- and position-dependent via get_k: c=1 uses 4 - l (e.g., 3 for l=1, adding cells at positions 11,9,7 relative to l=1); c=2 uses 1 if starting row s==1 (minimal, no extras) else 2; c>=3 uses c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3 adding at 11,9; 3 for c=4 adding at 11,9,7).
 * All drawing overwrites to c only for top/bottom (full 11 cells), legs (just endpoints), and crossbar (endpoints + extras); the output grid starts as all bg, so it reconstructs structures without copying extraneous input cells.
 * Process rows from top to bottom (s loop), skipping visited rows to prevent reprocessing overlaps; marks all rows from top to bottom (inclusive) as visited after drawing.
 * Subtlety: get_k's special case for c=2 depending on s==1 assumes position-specific rules (e.g., topmost structure gets minimal cross); this works for training but may fail if 2 appears elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: Structures are exactly 11 cells wide (l to l+10), starting at various l but fixed width; no rotation, vertical, or irregular shapes.
 * Subtlety: Input may have "clean" legs (bg between) but the program adds the crossbar, implying the puzzle is to complete/infer the cross; if input already has cross-like non-bg between legs, detection fails (is_leg returns False), skipping the structure.
 * All structures in test start at l=1, but code handles general l; background uniform from g[0][0].
 * No handling for isolated bars, fewer than 3 legs, or non-horizontal elements; assumes no overlapping structures (visited prevents but may miss interleaved ones).
 * Grid size: n rows, m=23 columns in test; l < m-10 to fit 11 cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color, essential for distinguishing structures and checking legs.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    return all(row[k] == c for k in range(l, l + 10))  # Note: range(l, l+11) would be correct for 11 cells; current is l to l+9 (10 cells)—potential off-by-one bug, but works if input matches.
```
(Checks for full horizontal bar of exactly 11 cells; critical for tops/bottoms; subtle off-by-one in range may cause issues for edge cases.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, bg: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[l + 10] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, l + 10):  # Checks l+1 to l+9 (9 cells); assumes input has bg here for valid leg.
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Key for detecting clean legs; strict bg requirement between endpoints ensures no premature crossbars in input.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar width; essential for color-specific completion; s-dependency for c=2 is position-aware but brittle if 2 moves.)

The main program function integrates these to detect, count legs, draw components, and mark visited rows; no types like classes needed, but could add a Structure dataclass for top/l/legs/bottom/k if refactoring.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it successfully passed all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection of full bars, legs, and crossbar drawing works for those cases.
 * Likely handled training structures with clean legs and position-specific k values (e.g., c=2 at s=1 getting k=1).
 * Potential missed subtlety: range in is_full is to l+10 (10 cells), but 11 needed (should be l+11); may coincidentally work if inputs align but risks missing 1-cell shorts.
 * get_k's s==1 for c=2 assumes fixed positioning; if training had 2 only at top, it passed, but generalizes poorly.
 * Visited marking from s to bottom inclusive prevents overlaps effectively in vertical stacking (as in test).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_full, is_leg, get_k) are relevant and core to detection/drawing—no broken ones noted, though is_full range is subtly imprecise.
 * No extraction of full objects attempted; code processes inline without storing structures, which works but could miss if needing to validate post-draw.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct based on puzzle rules: it reconstructs 4 stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23) with tops/bottoms as full 11-cell bars (cols 1-11), legs as endpoints only (cols 1 and 11), and crossbars added only in middle leg rows with color-specific widths—no extras for c=2 (k=1, row 3: just cols 1/11), one extra for c=3 (k=2, row 15: cols 1/9/11), two extras for c=4 and c=1 (k=3, rows 9/21: cols 1/7/9/11), all on bg elsewhere with no overlaps.
 * Expected: Input likely had clean outlines (full tops/bottoms, legs with bg between, no crossbars), and program completed crosses correctly without copying input extras; output isolates right-aligned cross patterns (e.g., no full horizontal cross, just stepped right-side fills + left leg).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Crossbars are not symmetric/full (e.g., gap between left leg at col 1 and right cross starting at col 7/9/11); this matches code but may be a subtlety— if puzzle expects connected/full bars, it's incorrect (unknown without true output, but consistent with training success).
 * For c=2, no change beyond legs (correct per k=1 and s=1); for others, added cells (e.g., row 9 cols 7/9 filled from bg to 4) complete the pattern without over-drawing.
 * All rows between structures (e.g., 0/6/12/18/24-26) are pure bg (8), and post-23 rows untouched; no artifacts or skips.
 * Overall, output demonstrates understanding: detects all 4 structures (num_leg=3 each), draws precisely, handles varying k; looks correct assuming puzzle goal is right-aligned cross completion.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:16:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detecting and reconstructing specific 5-row-high "ladder" or "table-like" structures in a grid, where each structure consists of colored bars and legs on a uniform background (8), and the output is a cleaned or redrawn version of the input grid with only valid structures rendered while ignoring or blanking invalid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must span exactly 11 columns (full top and bottom bars), with thin legs only at the exact left and right ends in the three middle rows (no extra colors in between, which must be background).
 * Background is determined from the top-left cell; all non-structure areas in output are filled with background.
 * Middle row (row s+2) includes a crossbar connecting the legs, with length varying by color c: for c=1, it's position-dependent (4 - l); for c=2, it's 1 or 2 segments based on a side parameter s (possibly start position); for c>=3, it's roughly c//2 + 1 segments, placed from the right end and stepping left by 2 columns each time.
 * Structures cannot overlap or extend beyond grid height (must fit within h-4 rows from start s); once detected and drawn, mark the 5 rows as visited to skip reprocessing.
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from top, finds candidate top bars of exactly length 11 in input row s, validates middle rows for thinness (only ends colored with c, rest background), and bottom row for full span of c.
 * Subtlety: Crossbar drawing starts from right end (r) and extends left in even steps (pos -= 2), which can create asymmetric or partial connections (e.g., for higher c, more rungs; for c=1/2, shorter or conditional).
 * Only process non-visited rows; break after drawing one structure per starting row block to avoid multiples.
 * Easy to miss: Bars must be exactly contiguous length 11 (no longer/shorter); thin check is strict (any non-bg in middle leg rows invalidates); crossbar count k can be miscalculated for edge cases like l/r positions or low c values.
 * Input may have noisy or incomplete structures, so output reinitializes to bg and redraws only validated ones.
 * Grid width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Determines bg reliably from top-left.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:  # Ensures room for 11-cell bar
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        c = row[i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))  # (left, right, color)
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans for exact 11-cell contiguous non-bg runs; essential for candidate detection.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Validates middle rows have only endpoint colors, rest bg; strict and key for leg thinness.)

```python
def is_full_span(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks bottom bar is fully colored with c; simple but critical.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l  # Position-dependent for c=1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Conditional on s (start row?) for c=2
    return c // 2 + 1  # General formula for higher c
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; handles special cases for low c, but s param usage unclear and potentially buggy.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h:
        return
    # top
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s][col] = c
    # bottom
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s + 4][col] = c
    # legs
    for mid in range(1, 4):
        row_idx = s + mid
        if row_idx < h:
            output[row_idx][l] = c
            output[row_idx][r] = c
    # crossbar (middle row only, from right, stepping left by 2)
    mid_row = s + 2
    if mid_row < h:
        output[mid_row][l] = c  # Left leg already set, but redundant here?
        output[mid_row][r] = c  # Right leg
        k = get_k(c, l, s)
        pos = r
        count = 0
        while count < k and pos >= l:
            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Core drawing logic; builds full structure including variable crossbar. Note: crossbar always includes endpoints, then adds k-? internals stepping left from r.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Prevents reprocessing drawn blocks; essential for non-overlapping detection.)

The main program orchestrates: init output to bg, scan rows, find/validate/draw/mark.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken, but get_k may be flawed for c=2 (s param is start row index, but logic "1 if s==1 else 2" seems arbitrary/unrelated to puzzle—possibly incorrect for test cases where s varies; could lead to inconsistent crossbars). find_bars skips bg correctly but assumes bars start after bg runs; might miss if bar touches edge (but i starts at 0, so okay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it successfully detected and redrew structures for all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection (11-bar top/bottom, thin legs) works for simple cases.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety in crossbar for c=2/1 not tested in training—could be why test needs review.
 * Visited marking and single-break per block prevented over-drawing in training.
 * No omissions or mismatches in training (all passed), but unknown if training had variable crossbars.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows four vertically stacked, non-overlapping 5-row structures (for c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), each with full top/bottom 11-cell bars starting at col=1, thin legs at col=1 and col=11 for the three middle rows, and background elsewhere; separated by all-bg rows (0,6,12,18,24-26).
 * For c=2 and c=3: Middle row (row 3 for first, 9 for second? Wait, for c=2: row 3 has only col1=2 and col11=2 (thin, no crossbar fill); same for c=3 at row 15 (only ends).
 * For c=4: Middle row 9 has col1=4, col7=4, col9=4, col11=4 (three internal fills, stepping left from 11: pos=11,9,7 >=1).
 * For c=1: Middle row 21 has col1=1, col7=1, col9=1, col11=1 (same pattern as c=4).
 * This looks mostly correct assuming input had these structures (program redrew cleanly on bg); crossbars match get_k logic (for c=4: 4//2+1=3 segments; for c=1: if l=1, 4-1=3 segments; for c=3: 3//2+1=2, but output shows only ends—wait, discrepancy: for c=3 middle row 15: only col1=3, col11=3, no internals like col9 or col7, so crossbar not filled beyond legs, suggesting get_k(3,l=1,s=13)=2 but drawing only added 0 internals? Wait, drawing always sets l and r, then adds k more stepping left, but if k=2, it should set pos=11 (already r), pos=9; but output lacks col9=3, so either input didn't validate or get_k miscomputed (s=13 !=1, but for c=3 uses general formula). For c=2 at s=1: get_k=1 if s==1, so adds 1 more (pos=11 already, then pos=9=2), but output row3 has no col9=2—only ends, so crossbar addition failed or k=0 effectively. Thus, test output does NOT fully match expected clean redraw: missing internal crossbar fills for c=2/3 (only legs drawn, no rungs), while c=1/4 have them; this differs from expected (should have partial rungs per color formula), likely due to get_k bug for c=2 (conditional on s==1 but doesn't add enough) or drawing loop (count starts after endpoints? No, loop sets pos=r which is already set). For c=3, k=2 should add one internal (pos=9), but absent—unknown why (perhaps validation failed in input, but output shows structure drawn, so partial). Overall, structures detected correctly, but crossbars incomplete for lower c, making output incorrect for full reconstruction.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with background cells and incomplete "balloon" or "blob" shapes made of colored cells (non-background). The goal is to detect specific 5-row high patterns (full horizontal span at top and bottom, thin vertical connections on the sides in the three middle rows) and complete them by filling a patterned interior in the central middle row (row start+2) using a color-specific pattern, then remove any remaining small connected components (size <20) that aren't part of valid completed shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows tall: a starting row with a horizontal span of >=10 consecutive cells of the same color (non-bg), a bottom row (start+4) that is fully filled with that color across the exact same span (no gaps, sides must align), and three middle rows (start+1 to start+3) that are "thin" (only the leftmost and rightmost cells of the span are the shape's color, with all interior cells strictly background; no extra colors or protrusions inside or outside the span in those rows).
 * Filling happens only in the exact central middle row (start+2), using a stepped pattern (every 2 cells starting from a color-specific offset within the span); the pattern must not overwrite existing side cells but adds interior ones. Different colors have unique offsets and patterns (e.g., color 8: dense alternating fill starting from left; color 4: sparser fill starting ~6 cells from left, adding 3 interior cells at positions like 7,9,11 for span 1-11; color 2: even sparser, starting ~8 from left, adding 2 interior cells like 9,11; color 1 similar to 4 but sometimes skips some positions; color 6: alternating but denser than 4, starting earlier). Over-filling (e.g., adding extra cells not in expected) breaks the pattern.
 * A key condition is that fewer than 3 of the middle rows can have "interfering" elements outside the span (i.e., cells that are non-bg and not the shape's color); if >=3 middle rows have such interference (e.g., parts of other shapes), don't fill to avoid corrupting adjacent objects. Shapes must not overlap or interfere horizontally in middle rows.
 * Background is always the most common cell value across the entire grid (via flat count); assume rectangular grid, all rows same width.
 * After all fills, perform 4-way connected flood-fill (up/down/left/right, same color only) to identify components and erase any with total size <20 cells (prevents noise or incomplete partials from remaining, but completed shapes are large enough ~28+ cells even unfilled due to connections, larger after fill).
 * Subtle: Spans must be exact matches top-to-bottom (same left/right positions); multiple shapes per grid, separated by bg; detection scans from top (start_row 0 to h-5); input likely has outlines already (full top/bottom + side stubs in middles), but fill only adds interior pattern if all conditions met—missing sides in input would fail "thin" check. Easy to miss: vertical connectivity makes unfilled shapes survive size check (~28 cells via top bar + bottom bar + 6 side cells); patterns are asymmetric or offset per color, not uniform; removal happens post-all-fills on a copy to avoid interfering with detection.
 * Grids are ~23x23, but generalize; no diagonal connections; only horizontal spans trigger (no vertical or diagonal patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg as most common value, essential for all checks.)

```python
def find_span(row: List[int], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int] | None:
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            length = i - start
            if length >= 10:
                return color, start, i - 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return None
```
(Helpful: Finds the first horizontal run of >=10 non-bg cells in a row, returns color + exact left/right bounds; critical for span detection, but assumes only one qualifying span per row—may miss if multiples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Verifies exact span is solidly filled with color, no bg or other intrusions; key for bottom row check.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= w:
        return False
    if row[left] != color or row[right] != color:
        return False
    for k in range(left + 1, right):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Confirms "thin neck" structure—sides present, interior strictly bg; essential for all three middle rows, fails if sides missing or interior cluttered.)

```python
def has_other_in_row(row: List[int], color: int, bg: int, left: int, right: int, w: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(w):
        if left <= k <= right:
            continue
        if row[k] != bg and row[k] != color:
            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful: Detects interference outside span in a row (non-bg, non-shape-color cells); used to count per middle row, ensures <3 rows affected before filling.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))
    size = 1
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(Helpful: 4-way flood-fill to compute connected component size and cells for a starting cell/color; crucial for post-process removal of small blobs <20; returns size and set of positions for targeted erasure.)

The `fill_row` function from the attempt is partially helpful (applies stepped pattern based on color) but broken in offsets/steps for some colors (e.g., overfills for color=1, underfills/skips for color=6; returns early for unknown colors, preventing any fill).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it demonstrates partial understanding: correctly detects bg, scans for 5-row structures via span/full/thin checks, applies color-specific stepped fills in middle row, and removes small components post-fill.
 * Worked: Structure detection logic (span >=10, exact bottom full, all middle thin, interference <3 rows) is solid in concept; removal via flood-fill correctly preserves large connected shapes (e.g., unfilled balloon ~28 cells via top/bottom bars + sides survives >20 threshold); patterns match exactly for some cases (e.g., train2 color=4 adds correct 8,10,12; train1 color=8 alternating if triggered; train1 color=4 adds 7,9,11 matching expected).
 * Didn't work: Fill never triggers in any training output (generated matches input outlines exactly—no interior patterns added), likely due to implementation bug (e.g., is_thin fails silently if input middles lack sides, but generated shows sides present, suggesting input already has outlines and detection skips for unknown reason like span bounds mismatch or loop indexing error); for train1, expected adds patterns to row3 (4's: +7,9,11), row9 (8's: alternating 1,3,5,7,9,11), row16 (2's: +9,11), but generated has only sides everywhere; for train2, expected adds to row4 (1's: +10,12 but code would wrongly add 8,10,12), row10 (6's: alternating 2,6,8,10,12 but code skips entirely via else return), row16 (4's: +8,10,12 matching but not added), generated only sides; for train3, expected adds denser patterns (4's row9: +5,7,9,11 but code only +7,9,11 missing 5; 1's row15: +5,7,9,11 but code +7,9,11 missing 5; 2's no fill needed, matches generated), but generated only sides (no adds anywhere); subtle: code's offsets (e.g., +6 for 1/4, +8 for 2, 0 for 8) are close but incomplete/wrong for 1/6 (needs adjustment like +4 or different step for density); num_with_other <3 prevents false positives but may over-block if minor interference.
 * Missed: Handling all colors (e.g., no pattern for 6, partial for 1/2/4 across examples); potential bug in triggering fill (e.g., range(h-4) misses lower shapes if h small; assumes first span only, may skip if multiple); doesn't add missing sides if input lacks them (but generated suggests input has them).
 * extract_objects not present, but compute_component_size serves as essential tool for post-removal (would be useful pre-process to isolate shapes).
 * fill_row is partially helpful for patterned fill but broken/not general (hardcoded offsets fail for train3 4's/1's by missing positions like +5; skips unknown colors; step=2 too rigid—some patterns may need step=1 or variable).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it replicates the input outlines (full top/bottom spans + thin sides in all three middle rows for each of four shapes: 2's rows1-5, 4's rows7-11, 3's rows13-17, 1's rows19-23) with no interior fills added, similar to all training generated outputs; based on training expecteds, it should add color-specific patterns to the central middle row (start+2) for each shape if conditions met (e.g., for 2's row3: add ~9,11 as in train1; for 4's row9: add ~7,9,11 or denser per train3; for 3's row15: unknown pattern but likely some interior like others; for 1's row21: add ~7,9,11 or denser). No small components removed (but none qualify as shapes are connected >20 even unfilled). This suggests same trigger failure as training (no changes), making output incomplete—expected would have patterned interiors (e.g., sparse dots/clusters per color) while preserving outlines and bg=8 elsewhere; without fills, shapes remain "incomplete" per puzzle rules. Do not look correct because they ignore the core completion step, leaving all shapes as mere outlines (mismatches all training expecteds' patterned bodies); to handle test, must fix trigger (e.g., verify input has sides, adjust offsets for 3/1 if similar to 4), ensure patterns match example densities (e.g., test 3's may need custom like alternating or +4 offset).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detecting and reconstructing specific 5-row-high "ladder" or "table-like" structures in a grid, where each structure consists of colored bars and legs on a uniform background (8), and the output is a cleaned or redrawn version of the input grid with only valid structures rendered while ignoring or blanking invalid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must span exactly 11 columns (full top and bottom bars), with thin legs only at the exact left and right ends in the three middle rows (no extra colors in between, which must be background).
 * Background is determined from the top-left cell; all non-structure areas in output are filled with background.
 * Middle row (row s+2) includes a crossbar connecting the legs, with length varying by color c: for c=1, it's position-dependent (4 - l); for c=2, it's 1 or 2 segments based on a side parameter s (possibly start position); for c>=3, it's roughly c//2 + 1 segments, placed from the right end and stepping left by 2 columns each time.
 * Structures cannot overlap or extend beyond grid height (must fit within h-4 rows from start s); once detected and drawn, mark the 5 rows as visited to skip reprocessing.
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from top, finds candidate top bars of exactly length 11 in input row s, validates middle rows for thinness (only ends colored with c, rest background), and bottom row for full span of c.
 * Subtlety: Crossbar drawing starts from right end (r) and extends left in even steps (pos -= 2), which can create asymmetric or partial connections (e.g., for higher c, more rungs; for c=1/2, shorter or conditional).
 * Only process non-visited rows; break after drawing one structure per starting row block to avoid multiples.
 * Easy to miss: Bars must be exactly contiguous length 11 (no longer/shorter); thin check is strict (any non-bg in middle leg rows invalidates); crossbar count k can be miscalculated for edge cases like l/r positions or low c values.
 * Input may have noisy or incomplete structures, so output reinitializes to bg and redraws only validated ones.
 * Grid width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Determines bg reliably from top-left.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:  # Ensures room for 11-cell bar
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        c = row[i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))  # (left, right, color)
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans for exact 11-cell contiguous non-bg runs; essential for candidate detection.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Validates middle rows have only endpoint colors, rest bg; strict and key for leg thinness.)

```python
def is_full_span(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks bottom bar is fully colored with c; simple but critical.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l  # Position-dependent for c=1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Conditional on s (start row?) for c=2
    return c // 2 + 1  # General formula for higher c
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; handles special cases for low c, but s param usage unclear and potentially buggy.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h:
        return
    # top
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s][col] = c
    # bottom
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s + 4][col] = c
    # legs
    for mid in range(1, 4):
        row_idx = s + mid
        if row_idx < h:
            output[row_idx][l] = c
            output[row_idx][r] = c
    # crossbar (middle row only, from right, stepping left by 2)
    mid_row = s + 2
    if mid_row < h:
        output[mid_row][l] = c  # Left leg already set, but redundant here?
        output[mid_row][r] = c  # Right leg
        k = get_k(c, l, s)
        pos = r
        count = 0
        while count < k and pos >= l:
            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Core drawing logic; builds full structure including variable crossbar. Note: crossbar always includes endpoints, then adds k-? internals stepping left from r.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Prevents reprocessing drawn blocks; essential for non-overlapping detection.)

The main program orchestrates: init output to bg, scan rows, find/validate/draw/mark.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken, but get_k may be flawed for c=2 (s param is start row index, but logic "1 if s==1 else 2" seems arbitrary/unrelated to puzzle—possibly incorrect for test cases where s varies; could lead to inconsistent crossbars). find_bars skips bg correctly but assumes bars start after bg runs; might miss if bar touches edge (but i starts at 0, so okay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it successfully detected and redrew structures for all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection (11-bar top/bottom, thin legs) works for simple cases.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety in crossbar for c=2/1 not tested in training—could be why test needs review.
 * Visited marking and single-break per block prevented over-drawing in training.
 * No omissions or mismatches in training (all passed), but unknown if training had variable crossbars.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows four vertically stacked, non-overlapping 5-row structures (for c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), each with full top/bottom 11-cell bars starting at col=1, thin legs at col=1 and col=11 for the three middle rows, and background elsewhere; separated by all-bg rows (0,6,12,18,24-26).
 * For c=2 and c=3: Middle row (row 3 for first, 9 for second? Wait, for c=2: row 3 has only col1=2 and col11=2 (thin, no crossbar fill); same for c=3 at row 15 (only ends).
 * For c=4: Middle row 9 has col1=4, col7=4, col9=4, col11=4 (three internal fills, stepping left from 11: pos=11,9,7 >=1).
 * For c=1: Middle row 21 has col1=1, col7=1, col9=1, col11=1 (same pattern as c=4).
 * This looks mostly correct assuming input had these structures (program redrew cleanly on bg); crossbars match get_k logic (for c=4: 4//2+1=3 segments; for c=1: if l=1, 4-1=3 segments; for c=3: 3//2+1=2, but output shows only ends—wait, discrepancy: for c=3 middle row 15: only col1=3, col11=3, no internals like col9 or col7, so crossbar not filled beyond legs, suggesting get_k(3,l=1,s=13)=2 but drawing only added 0 internals? Wait, drawing always sets l and r, then adds k more stepping left, but if k=2, it should set pos=11 (already r), pos=9; but output lacks col9=3, so either input didn't validate or get_k miscomputed (s=13 !=1, but for c=3 uses general formula). For c=2 at s=1: get_k=1 if s==1, so adds 1 more (pos=11 already, then pos=9=2), but output row3 has no col9=2—only ends, so crossbar addition failed or k=0 effectively. Thus, test output does NOT fully match expected clean redraw: missing internal crossbar fills for c=2/3 (only legs drawn, no rungs), while c=1/4 have them; this differs from expected (should have partial rungs per color formula), likely due to get_k bug for c=2 (conditional on s==1 but doesn't add enough) or drawing loop (count starts after endpoints? No, loop sets pos=r which is already set). For c=3, k=2 should add one internal (pos=9), but absent—unknown why (perhaps validation failed in input, but output shows structure drawn, so partial). Overall, structures detected correctly, but crossbars incomplete for lower c, making output incorrect for full reconstruction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (8) and incomplete table-like structures in different colors (1, 2, 3, 4), where each structure consists of a top horizontal bar of 11 consecutive cells, at least 3 vertical legs (pairs of colored cells at the ends with background in between), an optional bottom bar, and a crossbar that needs to be completed in the middle leg row. The program's task is to detect these structures in the input grid and output a new grid with the structures fully drawn, including adding the color-specific crossbar segments on the right side of the middle leg, while filling the rest with background and avoiding overlaps via a visited mechanism.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must start with exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c != background in a row, checked via is_full; shorter or longer bars are ignored.
 * Legs are detected downward from the top bar, requiring exactly two c cells at positions l and l+10 with all background (bg) strictly between (l+1 to l+9); if any non-bg appears between, it's not a valid leg (this ensures input legs are "clean" without premature crossbars).
 * At least 3 consecutive valid legs are required to process a structure; fewer are skipped.
 * Bottom bar is preferably detected as a full 11-cell bar exactly one row below the last leg (s + num_leg + 1); if not present or out of bounds, default to s + 4 (though not used in this test).
 * Crossbar is always drawn in the middle leg row (s + 1 + (num_leg // 2)), starting with the leg endpoints (l and l+10), then adding k-1 additional cells inward from the right endpoint at even steps (l+10 - 2*p for p=0 to k-1), creating a right-aligned "cross" pattern (e.g., for k=3: cells at l+10, l+8, l+6; left leg at l remains isolated).
 * Crossbar width k is color- and position-dependent via get_k: c=1 uses 4 - l (e.g., 3 for l=1, adding cells at positions 11,9,7 relative to l=1); c=2 uses 1 if starting row s==1 (minimal, no extras) else 2; c>=3 uses c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3 adding at 11,9; 3 for c=4 adding at 11,9,7).
 * All drawing overwrites to c only for top/bottom (full 11 cells), legs (just endpoints), and crossbar (endpoints + extras); the output grid starts as all bg, so it reconstructs structures without copying extraneous input cells.
 * Process rows from top to bottom (s loop), skipping visited rows to prevent reprocessing overlaps; marks all rows from top to bottom (inclusive) as visited after drawing.
 * Subtlety: get_k's special case for c=2 depending on s==1 assumes position-specific rules (e.g., topmost structure gets minimal cross); this works for training but may fail if 2 appears elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: Structures are exactly 11 cells wide (l to l+10), starting at various l but fixed width; no rotation, vertical, or irregular shapes.
 * Subtlety: Input may have "clean" legs (bg between) but the program adds the crossbar, implying the puzzle is to complete/infer the cross; if input already has cross-like non-bg between legs, detection fails (is_leg returns False), skipping the structure.
 * All structures in test start at l=1, but code handles general l; background uniform from g[0][0].
 * No handling for isolated bars, fewer than 3 legs, or non-horizontal elements; assumes no overlapping structures (visited prevents but may miss interleaved ones).
 * Grid size: n rows, m=23 columns in test; l < m-10 to fit 11 cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color, essential for distinguishing structures and checking legs.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    return all(row[k] == c for k in range(l, l + 10))  # Note: range(l, l+11) would be correct for 11 cells; current is l to l+9 (10 cells)—potential off-by-one bug, but works if input matches.
```
(Checks for full horizontal bar of exactly 11 cells; critical for tops/bottoms; subtle off-by-one in range may cause issues for edge cases.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, bg: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[l + 10] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, l + 10):  # Checks l+1 to l+9 (9 cells); assumes input has bg here for valid leg.
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Key for detecting clean legs; strict bg requirement between endpoints ensures no premature crossbars in input.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar width; essential for color-specific completion; s-dependency for c=2 is position-aware but brittle if 2 moves.)

The main program function integrates these to detect, count legs, draw components, and mark visited rows; no types like classes needed, but could add a Structure dataclass for top/l/legs/bottom/k if refactoring.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it successfully passed all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection of full bars, legs, and crossbar drawing works for those cases.
 * Likely handled training structures with clean legs and position-specific k values (e.g., c=2 at s=1 getting k=1).
 * Potential missed subtlety: range in is_full is to l+10 (10 cells), but 11 needed (should be l+11); may coincidentally work if inputs align but risks missing 1-cell shorts.
 * get_k's s==1 for c=2 assumes fixed positioning; if training had 2 only at top, it passed, but generalizes poorly.
 * Visited marking from s to bottom inclusive prevents overlaps effectively in vertical stacking (as in test).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_full, is_leg, get_k) are relevant and core to detection/drawing—no broken ones noted, though is_full range is subtly imprecise.
 * No extraction of full objects attempted; code processes inline without storing structures, which works but could miss if needing to validate post-draw.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct based on puzzle rules: it reconstructs 4 stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23) with tops/bottoms as full 11-cell bars (cols 1-11), legs as endpoints only (cols 1 and 11), and crossbars added only in middle leg rows with color-specific widths—no extras for c=2 (k=1, row 3: just cols 1/11), one extra for c=3 (k=2, row 15: cols 1/9/11), two extras for c=4 and c=1 (k=3, rows 9/21: cols 1/7/9/11), all on bg elsewhere with no overlaps.
 * Expected: Input likely had clean outlines (full tops/bottoms, legs with bg between, no crossbars), and program completed crosses correctly without copying input extras; output isolates right-aligned cross patterns (e.g., no full horizontal cross, just stepped right-side fills + left leg).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Crossbars are not symmetric/full (e.g., gap between left leg at col 1 and right cross starting at col 7/9/11); this matches code but may be a subtlety— if puzzle expects connected/full bars, it's incorrect (unknown without true output, but consistent with training success).
 * For c=2, no change beyond legs (correct per k=1 and s=1); for others, added cells (e.g., row 9 cols 7/9 filled from bg to 4) complete the pattern without over-drawing.
 * All rows between structures (e.g., 0/6/12/18/24-26) are pure bg (8), and post-23 rows untouched; no artifacts or skips.
 * Overall, output demonstrates understanding: detects all 4 structures (num_leg=3 each), draws precisely, handles varying k; looks correct assuming puzzle goal is right-aligned cross completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:24:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the program must detect incomplete 5-row-high table-like structures (with a full top bar, thin vertical legs in the middle three rows, and a full bottom bar) in an input grid and complete them in the output grid by filling in a specific crossbar pattern in the central middle row (row s+2). The structures are 11 units wide, use a consistent non-background color c for each, and the crossbar consists of c-colored pixels placed every other column starting from the right leg and extending leftward, with the number of crossbar positions determined by rules based on c (to form digit-like or symbolic patterns).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must be exactly 5 rows high (s to s+4), with top (s) and bottom (s+4) rows having exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (non-background), detected via run-length of length 11.
 * Middle three rows (s+1 to s+3) must be "thin" legs: only the left (l) and right (r = l+10) positions are c, with all positions between l+1 and r-1 being background (bg); any non-bg in between invalidates the structure.
 * Background bg is assumed to be the top-left cell value (g[0][0]); output grid starts as all bg and only modified where structures are drawn.
 * Crossbar is only in the exact central middle row (s+2), starting at pos = r and stepping left by 2 (pos -= 2) for k steps, where k depends on c: examples show k=1 for c=1 and c=2 (no visible extra beyond legs), k=2 for c=3 (adds one extra at r-2), k=3 for c=4 (adds two extras at r-2 and r-4), k=4 for c=6 (adds three extras at r-2, r-4, r-6); legs at l and r are always drawn in all middle rows, but crossbar may overlap r.
 * Structures do not overlap; use visited tracking to skip rows already covered (mark s to min(s+4, h) as visited after drawing).
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from 0 to h-5, finds candidate bars only in top row s, validates bottom and middles, then draws if valid; only one structure per starting s (breaks after first valid).
 * Subtlety: Crossbar rule is c-dependent and not simply c//2 +1 (works for c=3,4,6 but overdraws for c=1 with k=3 instead of k=1); special case for c=2 depending on s (k=1 if s==1 else 2) is inconsistent and likely incorrect, as it ties to row position rather than fixed per-c rule.
 * Width w assumed constant across rows; ignore bars shorter/longer than 11 or with length !=11.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar does not fill continuously but skips every other column (step -2 from r); for small k (e.g., 1), it only reinforces the right leg (no new pixels); structures may appear in any order/position but are processed top-to-bottom without reordering.
 * Output must exactly match input's detected parts but complete the crossbars; no drawing if validation fails (e.g., bottom not full, middle not thin).
 * Considerations across attempts: Scanning only unvisited rows prevents overlap; early break after drawing one per s avoids multiples; but get_k overestimates k for low c like 1, leading to extra pixels.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Helpful: Correctly identifies bg from top-left.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        c = row[i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))
        i = j
    return res
```
(Helpful: Accurately finds exactly 11-long runs of non-bg in a row, returning (left, right, color); ignores bg and shorter/longer runs; essential for candidate detection in top row.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Validates "thin legs" by checking only ends are c and interior is all bg; core to middle row validation.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Checks if a row segment from l to r is entirely c; used for top/bottom validation.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h:
        return
    # top
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s][col] = c
    # bottom
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s + 4][col] = c
    # legs in all three middle rows
    for mid in range(1, 4):
        row_idx = s + mid
        if row_idx < h:
            output[row_idx][l] = c
            output[row_idx][r] = c
    # crossbar in central middle row
    mid_row = s + 2
    if mid_row < h:
        k = get_k(c, s)  # Needs fixing for correct k per c
        pos = r
        count = 0
        while count < k and pos >= l:
            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Helpful: Draws the full structure if valid; fills top/bottom fully, legs at ends in middles, and crossbar every other from right; bounds-checked for h; but relies on broken get_k.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Helpful: Marks 5 rows as visited to skip overlaps; essential for non-overlapping processing.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, s: int) -> int:  # Current version broken
    if c == 1:
        return 3  # Wrong: should be 1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Inconsistent: should be fixed per c, e.g., 1
    return c // 2 + 1  # Works for c=3,4,6 but not low c
```
(Unhelpful/broken: Overdraws for c=1 (k=3 adds extras at r-2,r-4); special s-dependency for c=2 is arbitrary and likely wrong; needs rewrite to fixed per-c mapping, e.g., k = max(1, c // 2) or empirical: 1->1,2->1,3->2,4->3,6->4.)

The main program function orchestrates: init output/visited, scan s, find bars in g[s], validate full bottom and thin middles, draw if valid, mark visited. (Helpful overall structure, but fails due to get_k.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects structures via 11-long top bars, validates thin legs and full bottom, and draws tops/bottoms/legs accurately, as shown by training examples 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * What worked: For c=4 (k=3), crossbar correctly at r, r-2, r-4 (e.g., columns 12,10,8 plus leg at 2), matching expected; for c=6 (k=4), crossbar at r to r-6 step -2 (12,10,8,6 plus leg 2), matching expected; visited marking prevents overlaps, and thin/full checks are precise.
 * What didn't work: For c=1, get_k returns 3, drawing extra crossbar pixels at r-2=10 and r-4=8 (generated row 4: 1's at columns 2,8,10,12), but expected has only legs at 2 and 12 (no extras); this causes training example 2 to fail entirely due to mismatched middle row.
 * No other attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core detection/drawing logic; issue isolated to get_k for low c (1 and possibly 2).
 * find_bars, is_thin, is_full are essential and correct; draw_structure is mostly helpful but broken via get_k; mark_visited prevents errors in multi-structure grids.
 * get_k is broken/unhelpful in current form (overdraws extras for c=1, arbitrary s-dependency for c=2); don't use without fixing to per-c values (e.g., empirical mapping from examples).
 * Training 2 mismatches only in c=1 crossbar (extras at 8 and 10 unknown why expected omits, but clearly different: generated has four 1's, expected two); for c=4 and c=6, generated matches expected exactly (no differences noted).
 * No omissions or shape mismatches beyond crossbar; blob shapes match where k is correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it applies the same flawed logic: for c=1 (bottom structure, s=19?), k=3 draws extras at columns 7,9,11 (plus leg at 1: 1's at 1,7,9,11 in row 21), but based on training 2, this likely should be only legs at 1 and 11 (no extras, similar error as c=1 in training 2).
 * For c=2 (top structure, s=1), k=1 (due to s==1 special case) draws only at r=11 (already leg), resulting in only legs at 1 and 11 in row 3, which looks correct for a minimal crossbar (matches "1"-like thinness, no extras).
 * For c=4 (second structure, s=7?), k=3 draws at 11,9,7 (plus leg 1: 1,7,9,11 in row 9), which matches the pattern that worked in training 2, so likely correct.
 * For c=3 (third structure, s=13?), k=2 (3//2+1) draws at 11,9 (plus leg 1: 1,9,11 in row 15), which fits the incremental pattern (one extra vs. c=1/2), and looks sensible (no overdraw), likely correct.
 * Overall, test output is consistent with program logic but inherits the c=1 error (extra pixels in bottom structure's middle row); tops/bottoms/legs are correct everywhere; if c=1 should have no extras (as in training 2 expected), then test fails similarly—account for fixed k per c (e.g., 1 for c=1/2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4, 4 for 6) to handle low-c cases without s-dependency.

[2025-10-02 04:24:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with background cells and incomplete "balloon" or "blob" shapes made of colored cells (non-background). The goal is to detect specific 5-row high patterns (full horizontal span at top and bottom, thin vertical connections on the sides in the three middle rows) and complete them by filling a patterned interior in the central middle row (row start+2) using a color-specific pattern, then remove any remaining small connected components (size <20) that aren't part of valid completed shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows tall: a starting row with a horizontal span of >=10 consecutive cells of the same color (non-bg), a bottom row (start+4) that is fully filled with that color across the exact same span (no gaps, sides must align), and three middle rows (start+1 to start+3) that are "thin" (only the leftmost and rightmost cells of the span are the shape's color, with all interior cells strictly background; no extra colors or protrusions inside or outside the span in those rows).
 * Filling happens only in the exact central middle row (start+2), using a stepped pattern (every 2 cells starting from a color-specific offset within the span); the pattern must not overwrite existing side cells but adds interior ones. Different colors have unique offsets and patterns (e.g., color 8: dense alternating fill starting from left; color 4: sparser fill starting ~6 cells from left, adding 3 interior cells at positions like 7,9,11 for span 1-11; color 2: even sparser, starting ~8 from left, adding 2 interior cells like 9,11; color 1 similar to 4 but sometimes skips some positions; color 6: alternating but denser than 4, starting earlier). Over-filling (e.g., adding extra cells not in expected) breaks the pattern.
 * A key condition is that fewer than 3 of the middle rows can have "interfering" elements outside the span (i.e., cells that are non-bg and not the shape's color); if >=3 middle rows have such interference (e.g., parts of other shapes), don't fill to avoid corrupting adjacent objects. Shapes must not overlap or interfere horizontally in middle rows.
 * Background is always the most common cell value across the entire grid (via flat count); assume rectangular grid, all rows same width.
 * After all fills, perform 4-way connected flood-fill (up/down/left/right, same color only) to identify components and erase any with total size <20 cells (prevents noise or incomplete partials from remaining, but completed shapes are large enough ~28+ cells even unfilled due to connections, larger after fill).
 * Subtle: Spans must be exact matches top-to-bottom (same left/right positions); multiple shapes per grid, separated by bg; detection scans from top (start_row 0 to h-5); input likely has outlines already (full top/bottom + side stubs in middles), but fill only adds interior pattern if all conditions met—missing sides in input would fail "thin" check. Easy to miss: vertical connectivity makes unfilled shapes survive size check (~28 cells via top bar + bottom bar + 6 side cells); patterns are asymmetric or offset per color, not uniform; removal happens post-all-fills on a copy to avoid interfering with detection.
 * Grids are ~23x23, but generalize; no diagonal connections; only horizontal spans trigger (no vertical or diagonal patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg as most common value, essential for all checks.)

```python
def find_span(row: List[int], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int] | None:
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            length = i - start
            if length >= 10:
                return color, start, i - 1
        else:
            i += 1

(Helpful: Finds the first horizontal run of >=10 non-bg cells in a row, returns color + exact left/right bounds; critical for span detection, but assumes only one qualifying span per row—may miss if multiples.)

def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Verifies exact span is solidly filled with color, no bg or other intrusions; key for bottom row check.)

        if row[k] != bg:
            return False

(Helpful: Confirms "thin neck" structure—sides present, interior strictly bg; essential for all three middle rows, fails if sides missing or interior cluttered.)

(Helpful: Detects interference outside span in a row (non-bg, non-shape-color cells); used to count per middle row, ensures <3 rows affected before filling.)

    return size, visited
```
(Helpful: 4-way flood-fill to compute connected component size and cells for a starting cell/color; crucial for post-process removal of small blobs <20; returns size and set of positions for targeted erasure.)

The `fill_row` function from the attempt is partially helpful (applies stepped pattern based on color) but broken in offsets/steps for some colors (e.g., overfills for color=1, underfills/skips for color=6; returns early for unknown colors, preventing any fill).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it demonstrates partial understanding: correctly detects bg, scans for 5-row structures via span/full/thin checks, applies color-specific stepped fills in middle row, and removes small components post-fill.
 * Worked: Structure detection logic (span >=10, exact bottom full, all middle thin, interference <3 rows) is solid in concept; removal via flood-fill correctly preserves large connected shapes (e.g., unfilled balloon ~28 cells via top/bottom bars + sides survives >20 threshold); patterns match exactly for some cases (e.g., train2 color=4 adds correct 8,10,12; train1 color=8 alternating if triggered; train1 color=4 adds 7,9,11 matching expected).
 * Didn't work: Fill never triggers in any training output (generated matches input outlines exactly—no interior patterns added), likely due to implementation bug (e.g., is_thin fails silently if input middles lack sides, but generated shows sides present, suggesting input already has outlines and detection skips for unknown reason like span bounds mismatch or loop indexing error); for train1, expected adds patterns to row3 (4's: +7,9,11), row9 (8's: alternating 1,3,5,7,9,11), row16 (2's: +9,11), but generated has only sides everywhere; for train2, expected adds to row4 (1's: +10,12 but code would wrongly add 8,10,12), row10 (6's: alternating 2,6,8,10,12 but code skips entirely via else return), row16 (4's: +8,10,12 matching but not added), generated only sides; for train3, expected adds denser patterns (4's row9: +5,7,9,11 but code only +7,9,11 missing 5; 1's row15: +5,7,9,11 but code +7,9,11 missing 5; 2's no fill needed, matches generated), but generated only sides (no adds anywhere); subtle: code's offsets (e.g., +6 for 1/4, +8 for 2, 0 for 8) are close but incomplete/wrong for 1/6 (needs adjustment like +4 or different step for density); num_with_other <3 prevents false positives but may over-block if minor interference.
 * Missed: Handling all colors (e.g., no pattern for 6, partial for 1/2/4 across examples); potential bug in triggering fill (e.g., range(h-4) misses lower shapes if h small; assumes first span only, may skip if multiple); doesn't add missing sides if input lacks them (but generated suggests input has them).
 * extract_objects not present, but compute_component_size serves as essential tool for post-removal (would be useful pre-process to isolate shapes).
 * fill_row is partially helpful for patterned fill but broken/not general (hardcoded offsets fail for train3 4's/1's by missing positions like +5; skips unknown colors; step=2 too rigid—some patterns may need step=1 or variable).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it replicates the input outlines (full top/bottom spans + thin sides in all three middle rows for each of four shapes: 2's rows1-5, 4's rows7-11, 3's rows13-17, 1's rows19-23) with no interior fills added, similar to all training generated outputs; based on training expecteds, it should add color-specific patterns to the central middle row (start+2) for each shape if conditions met (e.g., for 2's row3: add ~9,11 as in train1; for 4's row9: add ~7,9,11 or denser per train3; for 3's row15: unknown pattern but likely some interior like others; for 1's row21: add ~7,9,11 or denser). No small components removed (but none qualify as shapes are connected >20 even unfilled). This suggests same trigger failure as training (no changes), making output incomplete—expected would have patterned interiors (e.g., sparse dots/clusters per color) while preserving outlines and bg=8 elsewhere; without fills, shapes remain "incomplete" per puzzle rules. Do not look correct because they ignore the core completion step, leaving all shapes as mere outlines (mismatches all training expecteds' patterned bodies); to handle test, must fix trigger (e.g., verify input has sides, adjust offsets for 3/1 if similar to 4), ensure patterns match example densities (e.g., test 3's may need custom like alternating or +4 offset).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detecting and reconstructing specific 5-row-high "ladder" or "table-like" structures in a grid, where each structure consists of colored bars and legs on a uniform background (8), and the output is a cleaned or redrawn version of the input grid with only valid structures rendered while ignoring or blanking invalid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must span exactly 11 columns (full top and bottom bars), with thin legs only at the exact left and right ends in the three middle rows (no extra colors in between, which must be background).
 * Background is determined from the top-left cell; all non-structure areas in output are filled with background.
 * Middle row (row s+2) includes a crossbar connecting the legs, with length varying by color c: for c=1, it's position-dependent (4 - l); for c=2, it's 1 or 2 segments based on a side parameter s (possibly start position); for c>=3, it's roughly c//2 + 1 segments, placed from the right end and stepping left by 2 columns each time.
 * Structures cannot overlap or extend beyond grid height (must fit within h-4 rows from start s); once detected and drawn, mark the 5 rows as visited to skip reprocessing.
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from top, finds candidate top bars of exactly length 11 in input row s, validates middle rows for thinness (only ends colored with c, rest background), and bottom row for full span of c.
 * Subtlety: Crossbar drawing starts from right end (r) and extends left in even steps (pos -= 2), which can create asymmetric or partial connections (e.g., for higher c, more rungs; for c=1/2, shorter or conditional).
 * Only process non-visited rows; break after drawing one structure per starting row block to avoid multiples.
 * Easy to miss: Bars must be exactly contiguous length 11 (no longer/shorter); thin check is strict (any non-bg in middle leg rows invalidates); crossbar count k can be miscalculated for edge cases like l/r positions or low c values.
 * Input may have noisy or incomplete structures, so output reinitializes to bg and redraws only validated ones.
 * Grid width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Determines bg reliably from top-left.)

```python

    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:  # Ensures room for 11-cell bar

            continue
        c = row[i]

            j += 1
        length = j - i
        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))  # (left, right, color)
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans for exact 11-cell contiguous non-bg runs; essential for candidate detection.)

    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Validates middle rows have only endpoint colors, rest bg; strict and key for leg thinness.)

```python
def is_full_span(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks bottom bar is fully colored with c; simple but critical.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l  # Position-dependent for c=1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Conditional on s (start row?) for c=2
    return c // 2 + 1  # General formula for higher c
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; handles special cases for low c, but s param usage unclear and potentially buggy.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h:
        return
    # top
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s][col] = c
    # bottom
    for col in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s + 4][col] = c
    # legs
    for mid in range(1, 4):
        row_idx = s + mid
        if row_idx < h:
            output[row_idx][l] = c
            output[row_idx][r] = c
    # crossbar (middle row only, from right, stepping left by 2)
    mid_row = s + 2
    if mid_row < h:
        output[mid_row][l] = c  # Left leg already set, but redundant here?
        output[mid_row][r] = c  # Right leg
        k = get_k(c, l, s)
        pos = r
        count = 0
        while count < k and pos >= l:
            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Core drawing logic; builds full structure including variable crossbar. Note: crossbar always includes endpoints, then adds k-? internals stepping left from r.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Prevents reprocessing drawn blocks; essential for non-overlapping detection.)

The main program orchestrates: init output to bg, scan rows, find/validate/draw/mark.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken, but get_k may be flawed for c=2 (s param is start row index, but logic "1 if s==1 else 2" seems arbitrary/unrelated to puzzle—possibly incorrect for test cases where s varies; could lead to inconsistent crossbars). find_bars skips bg correctly but assumes bars start after bg runs; might miss if bar touches edge (but i starts at 0, so okay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it successfully detected and redrew structures for all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection (11-bar top/bottom, thin legs) works for simple cases.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety in crossbar for c=2/1 not tested in training—could be why test needs review.
 * Visited marking and single-break per block prevented over-drawing in training.
 * No omissions or mismatches in training (all passed), but unknown if training had variable crossbars.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows four vertically stacked, non-overlapping 5-row structures (for c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), each with full top/bottom 11-cell bars starting at col=1, thin legs at col=1 and col=11 for the three middle rows, and background elsewhere; separated by all-bg rows (0,6,12,18,24-26).
 * For c=2 and c=3: Middle row (row 3 for first, 9 for second? Wait, for c=2: row 3 has only col1=2 and col11=2 (thin, no crossbar fill); same for c=3 at row 15 (only ends).
 * For c=4: Middle row 9 has col1=4, col7=4, col9=4, col11=4 (three internal fills, stepping left from 11: pos=11,9,7 >=1).
 * For c=1: Middle row 21 has col1=1, col7=1, col9=1, col11=1 (same pattern as c=4).
 * This looks mostly correct assuming input had these structures (program redrew cleanly on bg); crossbars match get_k logic (for c=4: 4//2+1=3 segments; for c=1: if l=1, 4-1=3 segments; for c=3: 3//2+1=2, but output shows only ends—wait, discrepancy: for c=3 middle row 15: only col1=3, col11=3, no internals like col9 or col7, so crossbar not filled beyond legs, suggesting get_k(3,l=1,s=13)=2 but drawing only added 0 internals? Wait, drawing always sets l and r, then adds k more stepping left, but if k=2, it should set pos=11 (already r), pos=9; but output lacks col9=3, so either input didn't validate or get_k miscomputed (s=13 !=1, but for c=3 uses general formula). For c=2 at s=1: get_k=1 if s==1, so adds 1 more (pos=11 already, then pos=9=2), but output row3 has no col9=2—only ends, so crossbar addition failed or k=0 effectively. Thus, test output does NOT fully match expected clean redraw: missing internal crossbar fills for c=2/3 (only legs drawn, no rungs), while c=1/4 have them; this differs from expected (should have partial rungs per color formula), likely due to get_k bug for c=2 (conditional on s==1 but doesn't add enough) or drawing loop (count starts after endpoints? No, loop sets pos=r which is already set). For c=3, k=2 should add one internal (pos=9), but absent—unknown why (perhaps validation failed in input, but output shows structure drawn, so partial). Overall, structures detected correctly, but crossbars incomplete for lower c, making output incorrect for full reconstruction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the program must detect incomplete 5-row-high table-like structures (with a full top bar, thin vertical legs in the middle three rows, and a full bottom bar) in an input grid and complete them in the output grid by filling in a specific crossbar pattern in the central middle row (row s+2). The structures are 11 units wide, use a consistent non-background color c for each, and the crossbar consists of c-colored pixels placed every other column starting from the right leg and extending leftward, with the number of crossbar positions determined by rules based on c (to form digit-like or symbolic patterns).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must be exactly 5 rows high (s to s+4), with top (s) and bottom (s+4) rows having exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (non-background), detected via run-length of length 11.
 * Middle three rows (s+1 to s+3) must be "thin" legs: only the left (l) and right (r = l+10) positions are c, with all positions between l+1 and r-1 being background (bg); any non-bg in between invalidates the structure.
 * Background bg is assumed to be the top-left cell value (g[0][0]); output grid starts as all bg and only modified where structures are drawn.
 * Crossbar is only in the exact central middle row (s+2), starting at pos = r and stepping left by 2 (pos -= 2) for k steps, where k depends on c: examples show k=1 for c=1 and c=2 (no visible extra beyond legs), k=2 for c=3 (adds one extra at r-2), k=3 for c=4 (adds two extras at r-2 and r-4), k=4 for c=6 (adds three extras at r-2, r-4, r-6); legs at l and r are always drawn in all middle rows, but crossbar may overlap r.
 * Structures do not overlap; use visited tracking to skip rows already covered (mark s to min(s+4, h) as visited after drawing).
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from 0 to h-5, finds candidate bars only in top row s, validates bottom and middles, then draws if valid; only one structure per starting s (breaks after first valid).
 * Subtlety: Crossbar rule is c-dependent and not simply c//2 +1 (works for c=3,4,6 but overdraws for c=1 with k=3 instead of k=1); special case for c=2 depending on s (k=1 if s==1 else 2) is inconsistent and likely incorrect, as it ties to row position rather than fixed per-c rule.
 * Width w assumed constant across rows; ignore bars shorter/longer than 11 or with length !=11.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar does not fill continuously but skips every other column (step -2 from r); for small k (e.g., 1), it only reinforces the right leg (no new pixels); structures may appear in any order/position but are processed top-to-bottom without reordering.
 * Output must exactly match input's detected parts but complete the crossbars; no drawing if validation fails (e.g., bottom not full, middle not thin).
 * Considerations across attempts: Scanning only unvisited rows prevents overlap; early break after drawing one per s avoids multiples; but get_k overestimates k for low c like 1, leading to extra pixels.

(Helpful: Draws the full structure if valid; fills top/bottom fully, legs at ends in middles, and crossbar every other from right; bounds-checked for h; but relies on broken get_k.)

        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Inconsistent: should be fixed per c, e.g., 1
    return c // 2 + 1  # Works for c=3,4,6 but not low c
```
(Unhelpful/broken: Overdraws for c=1 (k=3 adds extras at r-2,r-4); special s-dependency for c=2 is arbitrary and likely wrong; needs rewrite to fixed per-c mapping, e.g., k = max(1, c // 2) or empirical: 1->1,2->1,3->2,4->3,6->4.)

The main program function orchestrates: init output/visited, scan s, find bars in g[s], validate full bottom and thin middles, draw if valid, mark visited. (Helpful overall structure, but fails due to get_k.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects structures via 11-long top bars, validates thin legs and full bottom, and draws tops/bottoms/legs accurately, as shown by training examples 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * What worked: For c=4 (k=3), crossbar correctly at r, r-2, r-4 (e.g., columns 12,10,8 plus leg at 2), matching expected; for c=6 (k=4), crossbar at r to r-6 step -2 (12,10,8,6 plus leg 2), matching expected; visited marking prevents overlaps, and thin/full checks are precise.
 * What didn't work: For c=1, get_k returns 3, drawing extra crossbar pixels at r-2=10 and r-4=8 (generated row 4: 1's at columns 2,8,10,12), but expected has only legs at 2 and 12 (no extras); this causes training example 2 to fail entirely due to mismatched middle row.
 * No other attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core detection/drawing logic; issue isolated to get_k for low c (1 and possibly 2).
 * find_bars, is_thin, is_full are essential and correct; draw_structure is mostly helpful but broken via get_k; mark_visited prevents errors in multi-structure grids.
 * get_k is broken/unhelpful in current form (overdraws extras for c=1, arbitrary s-dependency for c=2); don't use without fixing to per-c values (e.g., empirical mapping from examples).
 * Training 2 mismatches only in c=1 crossbar (extras at 8 and 10 unknown why expected omits, but clearly different: generated has four 1's, expected two); for c=4 and c=6, generated matches expected exactly (no differences noted).
 * No omissions or shape mismatches beyond crossbar; blob shapes match where k is correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it applies the same flawed logic: for c=1 (bottom structure, s=19?), k=3 draws extras at columns 7,9,11 (plus leg at 1: 1's at 1,7,9,11 in row 21), but based on training 2, this likely should be only legs at 1 and 11 (no extras, similar error as c=1 in training 2).
 * For c=2 (top structure, s=1), k=1 (due to s==1 special case) draws only at r=11 (already leg), resulting in only legs at 1 and 11 in row 3, which looks correct for a minimal crossbar (matches "1"-like thinness, no extras).
 * For c=4 (second structure, s=7?), k=3 draws at 11,9,7 (plus leg 1: 1,7,9,11 in row 9), which matches the pattern that worked in training 2, so likely correct.
 * For c=3 (third structure, s=13?), k=2 (3//2+1) draws at 11,9 (plus leg 1: 1,9,11 in row 15), which fits the incremental pattern (one extra vs. c=1/2), and looks sensible (no overdraw), likely correct.
 * Overall, test output is consistent with program logic but inherits the c=1 error (extra pixels in bottom structure's middle row); tops/bottoms/legs are correct everywhere; if c=1 should have no extras (as in training 2 expected), then test fails similarly—account for fixed k per c (e.g., 1 for c=1/2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4, 4 for 6) to handle low-c cases without s-dependency.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (8) and incomplete table-like structures in different colors (1, 2, 3, 4), where each structure consists of a top horizontal bar of 11 consecutive cells, at least 3 vertical legs (pairs of colored cells at the ends with background in between), an optional bottom bar, and a crossbar that needs to be completed in the middle leg row. The program's task is to detect these structures in the input grid and output a new grid with the structures fully drawn, including adding the color-specific crossbar segments on the right side of the middle leg, while filling the rest with background and avoiding overlaps via a visited mechanism.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must start with exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c != background in a row, checked via is_full; shorter or longer bars are ignored.
 * Legs are detected downward from the top bar, requiring exactly two c cells at positions l and l+10 with all background (bg) strictly between (l+1 to l+9); if any non-bg appears between, it's not a valid leg (this ensures input legs are "clean" without premature crossbars).
 * At least 3 consecutive valid legs are required to process a structure; fewer are skipped.
 * Bottom bar is preferably detected as a full 11-cell bar exactly one row below the last leg (s + num_leg + 1); if not present or out of bounds, default to s + 4 (though not used in this test).
 * Crossbar is always drawn in the middle leg row (s + 1 + (num_leg // 2)), starting with the leg endpoints (l and l+10), then adding k-1 additional cells inward from the right endpoint at even steps (l+10 - 2*p for p=0 to k-1), creating a right-aligned "cross" pattern (e.g., for k=3: cells at l+10, l+8, l+6; left leg at l remains isolated).
 * Crossbar width k is color- and position-dependent via get_k: c=1 uses 4 - l (e.g., 3 for l=1, adding cells at positions 11,9,7 relative to l=1); c=2 uses 1 if starting row s==1 (minimal, no extras) else 2; c>=3 uses c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3 adding at 11,9; 3 for c=4 adding at 11,9,7).
 * All drawing overwrites to c only for top/bottom (full 11 cells), legs (just endpoints), and crossbar (endpoints + extras); the output grid starts as all bg, so it reconstructs structures without copying extraneous input cells.
 * Process rows from top to bottom (s loop), skipping visited rows to prevent reprocessing overlaps; marks all rows from top to bottom (inclusive) as visited after drawing.
 * Subtlety: get_k's special case for c=2 depending on s==1 assumes position-specific rules (e.g., topmost structure gets minimal cross); this works for training but may fail if 2 appears elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: Structures are exactly 11 cells wide (l to l+10), starting at various l but fixed width; no rotation, vertical, or irregular shapes.
 * Subtlety: Input may have "clean" legs (bg between) but the program adds the crossbar, implying the puzzle is to complete/infer the cross; if input already has cross-like non-bg between legs, detection fails (is_leg returns False), skipping the structure.
 * All structures in test start at l=1, but code handles general l; background uniform from g[0][0].
 * No handling for isolated bars, fewer than 3 legs, or non-horizontal elements; assumes no overlapping structures (visited prevents but may miss interleaved ones).
 * Grid size: n rows, m=23 columns in test; l < m-10 to fit 11 cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color, essential for distinguishing structures and checking legs.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    return all(row[k] == c for k in range(l, l + 10))  # Note: range(l, l+11) would be correct for 11 cells; current is l to l+9 (10 cells)—potential off-by-one bug, but works if input matches.
```
(Checks for full horizontal bar of exactly 11 cells; critical for tops/bottoms; subtle off-by-one in range may cause issues for edge cases.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, bg: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[l + 10] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, l + 10):  # Checks l+1 to l+9 (9 cells); assumes input has bg here for valid leg.
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Key for detecting clean legs; strict bg requirement between endpoints ensures no premature crossbars in input.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar width; essential for color-specific completion; s-dependency for c=2 is position-aware but brittle if 2 moves.)

The main program function integrates these to detect, count legs, draw components, and mark visited rows; no types like classes needed, but could add a Structure dataclass for top/l/legs/bottom/k if refactoring.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it successfully passed all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection of full bars, legs, and crossbar drawing works for those cases.
 * Likely handled training structures with clean legs and position-specific k values (e.g., c=2 at s=1 getting k=1).
 * Potential missed subtlety: range in is_full is to l+10 (10 cells), but 11 needed (should be l+11); may coincidentally work if inputs align but risks missing 1-cell shorts.
 * get_k's s==1 for c=2 assumes fixed positioning; if training had 2 only at top, it passed, but generalizes poorly.
 * Visited marking from s to bottom inclusive prevents overlaps effectively in vertical stacking (as in test).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_full, is_leg, get_k) are relevant and core to detection/drawing—no broken ones noted, though is_full range is subtly imprecise.
 * No extraction of full objects attempted; code processes inline without storing structures, which works but could miss if needing to validate post-draw.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct based on puzzle rules: it reconstructs 4 stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23) with tops/bottoms as full 11-cell bars (cols 1-11), legs as endpoints only (cols 1 and 11), and crossbars added only in middle leg rows with color-specific widths—no extras for c=2 (k=1, row 3: just cols 1/11), one extra for c=3 (k=2, row 15: cols 1/9/11), two extras for c=4 and c=1 (k=3, rows 9/21: cols 1/7/9/11), all on bg elsewhere with no overlaps.
 * Expected: Input likely had clean outlines (full tops/bottoms, legs with bg between, no crossbars), and program completed crosses correctly without copying input extras; output isolates right-aligned cross patterns (e.g., no full horizontal cross, just stepped right-side fills + left leg).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Crossbars are not symmetric/full (e.g., gap between left leg at col 1 and right cross starting at col 7/9/11); this matches code but may be a subtlety— if puzzle expects connected/full bars, it's incorrect (unknown without true output, but consistent with training success).
 * For c=2, no change beyond legs (correct per k=1 and s=1); for others, added cells (e.g., row 9 cols 7/9 filled from bg to 4) complete the pattern without over-drawing.
 * All rows between structures (e.g., 0/6/12/18/24-26) are pure bg (8), and post-23 rows untouched; no artifacts or skips.
 * Overall, output demonstrates understanding: detects all 4 structures (num_leg=3 each), draws precisely, handles varying k; looks correct assuming puzzle goal is right-aligned cross completion.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:35:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain partial or outlined "symbols" (likely letters or shapes) formed by aligned vertical "legs" (spans of the same non-background color) in three consecutive rows, flanked by full top and bottom bars of the same color; the program must detect these alignments and complete the 5-row-high symbol by filling specific internal patterns unique to each color (1,2,3,4,6,8), while removing any small disconnected components at the end. The background color is the most common in the grid, and symbols are drawn on a background-filled output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Symbols span exactly 5 rows: a full top bar (row s), three rows of "legs" (rows s+1 to s+3, where legs are vertical non-background spans separated by background, at least 10 units wide in the examples), and a full bottom bar (row s+4); only alignments where all three legs overlap in the same columns and match top/bottom bars trigger drawing.
 * Internal patterns vary by color and are not uniform: e.g., for color 4, the third leg row (s+3, 0-indexed within block) has isolated fills at specific offsets like columns 7,9,11; for color 8, the second leg row has a dotted pattern every other column (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9,11); for color 2, the third leg row has fills at column 9 and 11; for color 1, similar dotted or offset patterns in middle rows; these seem to resemble letterforms (e.g., 4 like 'A' with crossbar, 8 like 'B' with curves, 2 like 'Z' with diagonal).
 * Leg detection must handle "clean" separations: a leg starts with color c, followed by background gap (at least 1?), then another c, but the code's find_legs looks for c, then background(s), then c again with no non-bg in gap, and requires span >=10; however, it skips if extra c's appear immediately after, and it doesn't correctly identify multi-leg structures or varying widths.
 * The "k" value for filling central patterns depends on color but also subtly on position (l, s) or size; current get_k is ad-hoc and incorrect (e.g., for c=4, it uses c//2+1=3, but expected patterns suggest more/less fills; for c=2, it varies by s==1, but examples show consistent per-color logic).
 * Background is correctly the mode color (1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test), but output starts fully bg-filled.
 * Post-processing removes components <20 cells, which is helpful to clean noise but may remove intended small parts if patterns have thin elements; in examples, it doesn't affect mains but could if internals are sparse.
 * Grids are ~22x23, with symbols left-aligned (starting col~1), separated by bg rows; multiple symbols per grid (e.g., train1 has 4,8,2; test has 2,4,3,1).
 * Subtle: Patterns may step inward or have offsets (e.g., effective_r = l+10 assumes fixed 10-width, but legs vary); filling in mid_row (s+2) goes left every 2 steps for k times, but expected shows right-side or centered dots/bars; for some colors (3?), no internals needed, just frame.
 * Overlaps or adjacent symbols must not interfere (e.g., train3 has 2,4,1 with bg=3, no bleed).
 * Easy to miss: Legs aren't always full-height in input (input shows only legs, program adds top/bottom/internals); detection requires exact column overlap across three rows; colors are digits 1-8, bg varies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the most common color, used in all examples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This verifies full bars, essential for top/bottom checks; works but assumes exact span match.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))
    size = 1
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(This flood-fill computes connected component size and cells; very helpful for final cleanup of small noise <20 cells, as used in program; prevents false positives from tiny blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects background and initializes output as full bg.
 * It identifies leg positions in rows s+1 to s+3 via find_legs (which looks for c-bg(s)-c patterns with clean bg gap and span>=10), finds common column overlaps across three rows, and verifies top/bottom full bars— this works for positioning the outer frames (top full, bottom full, left/right sides in mid rows) in all training examples and test.
 * For train1 (bg=1, symbols at ~rows1-5 for4,7-11 for8,13-17 for2): Outer frames drawn correctly (e.g., full 4's top/bottom cols1-11, sides at col1/11 in rows2-4; similar for8 cols1-11,2 cols1-11), and small component removal doesn't erase mains.
 * For train2 (bg=8, symbols at ~rows2-6 for1? but actually1's are thin, then8-12 for6,14-18 for4): Frames correct (e.g.,6's top/bottom full cols2-12, sides col2/12;4's similar), but note train2 input likely has legs for1,6,4.
 * For train3 (bg=3, symbols at ~rows1-5 for2,7-11 for4,13-17 for1): Frames correct (e.g.,2's cols1-11, etc.).
 * Test output: Detects and frames symbols correctly for2 (rows1-5 cols1-11),4 (7-11),3 (13-17? but3 is solid? wait, legs for3?),1 (19-23 cols1-11), with bg=8 and separations.
 * What didn't work: Internal patterns completely missing or wrong in all cases—program only draws left side (col l), right side (col r in rows s+1,s+3; effective_r=l+10 in s+2), and a backward every-2-step fill in s+2 for k steps (based on flawed get_k, e.g., for c=4 k=3 so fills 3 positions left from l+10, but expected has forward/right-side isolated fills like col7,9,11 in row s+3 for4).
 * Specific differences: Train1 for4 block (rows~1-5): Generated has empty internals (only sides), expected has in row3 (s+2?): 4 at cols7,9,11; row4 (s+3): nothing extra but wait, expected row3 has 4 at1,7,9,11? (mismatch in which row); for8 block row9 (s+2 for8): generated empty, expected 8 at3,5,7,9,11 (dotted); for2 block row15 (s+2): generated empty, expected 2 at9,11. Train2 for1 block (rows~2-6): generated has sides only (but1's expected has internals in row4:1 at9? from pattern), diff: missing dots at col9,11 in row4; for6 block row10 (s+2): empty vs expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11? wait row10 expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11 (full row11? no, row10 is s+2 with dots); for4 block row16 (s+2): empty vs expected 4 at9,11. Train3 similar misses: for4 row9 empty vs expected 4 at7,9,11; for1 row15 empty vs expected 1 at7,9,11. Reasons unknown but likely wrong filling logic (backward vs forward, wrong row, wrong k/positions).
 * find_legs is partially helpful (detects spans) but broken: it requires exact c-bg-c with no extras, skips if post-gap has immediate c, assumes fixed ~10 width via effective_r=l+10 (but legs vary, e.g., train1 4's legs cols1-1? no, legs are single-col? wait, input legs are thin verticals at edges, but code treats as wide span); it misses multi-col legs or non-10 widths, leading to wrong effective_r and common sets.
 * get_k is unhelpful/broken: ad-hoc rules don't match patterns (e.g., c=1 uses l which is position, but patterns are fixed per color; c=2 depends on s==1, but train1/3 2's at different s have similar patterns; c=3=1, but train3 1's? wait 1's pattern; c=8=6 fixed, but expected dots suggest variable).
 * Overall, core detection works (positions/frames), but internals fail due to wrong pattern logic, wrong widths, and no per-color templates; small removal is fine but irrelevant here as no noise shown.
 * Program loops s in 0 to h-5, checks legs in s+1..s+3, good for multiple blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output frames the symbols correctly (e.g., full top/bottom for each block, sides at col1/11 or similar, separations with bg=8 rows), matching the structure of training examples, but lacks all internal patterns, just like the training failures—e.g., for the 2 block (rows1-5), expected likely has dots/bars in row3 or4 (similar to train1's 2 with fills at9,11); for4 (rows7-11), missing crossbar-like fills (e.g., at7,9,11); for3 (rows13-17), possibly solid or minimal but code draws frame only; for1 (rows19-23), missing dotted internals (e.g., every other from right). This does not look correct because training expects color-specific internals (dots, bars) inside the frames, not empty; the output resembles incomplete outlines, failing to "complete" the symbols as in expected trains. To handle test, need per-color pattern templates (e.g., dict of fill positions/rows) instead of generic k-fill, and better leg width detection (not fixed +10).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 04:35:52] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties that show consistent interactions or effects across **all** train examples (inputs and outputs). Only obvious, direct connections are included—based on color, count, position, holes, pixels, and spatial enclosure—that appear in every example without variation in the nature of the interaction. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific exact positions of added pixels, which vary; semantic shapes like crosses or L's, which are not distinctly identifiable in the data; background bbox changes, which are not uniform; or one-off pixel losses not tied to counts) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., why background holes always decrease to exactly 3 in trains, despite a consistent count-based rule) are noted but not forced into explanations. No high-level puzzle solution or total transformation is provided.

#### Core Components
- **Background**: Large enclosing area (bbox covering full canvas, e.g., [0,0,22,22]; high holes, e.g., 8+; color B, e.g., Blue/Maroon/Green; high pixels, e.g., 265+). Serves as canvas; color B is consistent input-to-output.
- **Frames**: Medium rectangular borders (holes=1; pixels=28; bbox e.g., [1,1,11,5]; color C, e.g., Yellow/Maroon/Red/Pink/Blue). Nested/standalone; enclose inners spatially (inner bbox always subset of frame bbox, offset by ~1 unit). Unchanged input-to-output (color C, holes, pixels, bbox fixed).
- **Inners**: Medium filled rectangles (holes=0 input; pixels=27 input; bbox inside frame, e.g., [2,2,10,4]; color always matches background color B). Spatially enclosed by frames; change input-to-output based on interactions.
- **Small Scattered**: Tiny non-enclosed solids (holes=0; pixels=2–8; various bbox; color C matching some frames; e.g., single pixels to small blocks). Positioned outside frames/inners/background (e.g., edges or gaps); removed input-to-output.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These occur in **every** train example without exception. Interactions are bidirectional where noted (e.g., smalls affect multiple components). Properties linked: color, count (number of items), pixels, holes, position (spatial containment).

1. **Small Scattered → Background (absorption via pixels and count)**:
   - All small scattered components (regardless of their color C) are removed from output.
   - Their total pixel count is added to background pixels (input background pixels + sum of all small pixels = output background pixels; exact match in every example, e.g., +28 in Train 1, +27 in Train 2, +30 in Train 3).
   - Background holes decrease by the total count (number) of small scattered components (input holes - count of smalls = output holes; e.g., 12-9=3 in Train 1; unknown why output always stabilizes at 3 holes despite rule, but decrement is consistent).
   - Background color B unchanged.
   - No position effect (smalls can be anywhere outside; absorption is global).

2. **Small Scattered (color C) → Frame (color C) + Inner (via count N)**:
   - For each frame of color C, N = exact count (number) of small scattered components matching color C (e.g., N=2 for Yellow frame if 2 Yellow smalls; N=0 if none, as in Train 3 upper Red frame).
   - This count N affects the inner enclosed by that frame (color B):
     - Inner pixels decrease by exactly N (input 27 - N = output pixels; e.g., 27-2=25).
     - Inner holes increase by exactly N (input 0 + N = output holes; e.g., 0+2=2).
   - Inner color B unchanged.
   - Frame itself unaffected (unchanged as noted).
   - Consistent only if a frame of color C exists; no cross-frame effects (each frame/inner pair independent).

3. **Frame (color C) + Inner → New Small Components (via color and position)**:
   - Bidirectional with above: Using N from small scattered of color C, exactly N new 1-pixel components (holes=0; pixels=1; bbox single cell, e.g., [7,3,7,3]) of color C (matching frame) are added in output.
   - Position effect: All N new 1px are placed within the inner's bbox (spatial containment; e.g., x 2–10, central y row of inner). Exact x/y varies (not consistent), but always inside inner bounds.
   - These new 1px are separate components (not merged with inner or frame); color C from frame propagates to them.
   - If N=0, no new components added (inner unchanged).

4. **Frame ↔ Inner (spatial and color consistency)**:
   - Frame always spatially encloses inner (inner bbox subset/offset inside frame bbox; consistent offset pattern, e.g., +1 unit margins).
   - Inner color always = background color B (propagation from background; holds input-to-output).
   - No other effects (e.g., frames do not change inners without N from smalls).

#### Notes on Scope and Unknowns
- These interactions cover all changing elements consistently; static elements (e.g., frame pixels=28 fixed) have no interactions.
- No consistent interactions involving: non-C colors of smalls with non-matching frames; background with frames/inners directly (only via smalls); hole counts beyond count-based decrements; pixel sizes of smalls affecting N (N is by component count, not pixel total); or transformations outside these (e.g., no consistent bbox shifts).
- In Train 3 upper, N=0 leads to no change—confirms rule holds even without addition.
- Visual descriptions (e.g., crosses/L-shapes) not identifiable as distinct components in data (all additions are 1px squares); no forced connection.
- Test input follows same component structure (e.g., 4 frames with maroon=B inners, maroon bg, various C smalls), but no output provided for verification.

[2025-10-02 04:37:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties that show consistent interactions or effects across **all** train examples (inputs and outputs). Only obvious, direct connections are included—based on color, count, position, holes, pixels, and spatial enclosure—that appear in every example without variation in the nature of the interaction. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific exact positions of added pixels, which vary; semantic shapes like crosses or L's, which are not distinctly identifiable in the data; background bbox changes, which are not uniform; or one-off pixel losses not tied to counts) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., why background holes always decrease to exactly 3 in trains, despite a consistent count-based rule) are noted but not forced into explanations. No high-level puzzle solution or total transformation is provided.

#### Core Components
- **Background**: Large enclosing area (bbox covering full canvas, e.g., [0,0,22,22]; high holes, e.g., 8+; color B, e.g., Blue/Maroon/Green; high pixels, e.g., 265+). Serves as canvas; color B is consistent input-to-output.
- **Frames**: Medium rectangular borders (holes=1; pixels=28; bbox e.g., [1,1,11,5]; color C, e.g., Yellow/Maroon/Red/Pink/Blue). Nested/standalone; enclose inners spatially (inner bbox always subset of frame bbox, offset by ~1 unit). Unchanged input-to-output (color C, holes, pixels, bbox fixed).
- **Inners**: Medium filled rectangles (holes=0 input; pixels=27 input; bbox inside frame, e.g., [2,2,10,4]; color always matches background color B). Spatially enclosed by frames; change input-to-output based on interactions.
- **Small Scattered**: Tiny non-enclosed solids (holes=0; pixels=2–8; various bbox; color C matching some frames; e.g., single pixels to small blocks). Positioned outside frames/inners/background (e.g., edges or gaps); removed input-to-output.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These occur in **every** train example without exception. Interactions are bidirectional where noted (e.g., smalls affect multiple components). Properties linked: color, count (number of items), pixels, holes, position (spatial containment).

1. **Small Scattered → Background (absorption via pixels and count)**:
   - All small scattered components (regardless of their color C) are removed from output.
   - Their total pixel count is added to background pixels (input background pixels + sum of all small pixels = output background pixels; exact match in every example, e.g., +28 in Train 1, +27 in Train 2, +30 in Train 3).
   - Background holes decrease by the total count (number) of small scattered components (input holes - count of smalls = output holes; e.g., 12-9=3 in Train 1; unknown why output always stabilizes at 3 holes despite rule, but decrement is consistent).
   - Background color B unchanged.
   - No position effect (smalls can be anywhere outside; absorption is global).

2. **Small Scattered (color C) → Frame (color C) + Inner (via count N)**:
   - For each frame of color C, N = exact count (number) of small scattered components matching color C (e.g., N=2 for Yellow frame if 2 Yellow smalls; N=0 if none, as in Train 3 upper Red frame).
   - This count N affects the inner enclosed by that frame (color B):
     - Inner pixels decrease by exactly N (input 27 - N = output pixels; e.g., 27-2=25).
     - Inner holes increase by exactly N (input 0 + N = output holes; e.g., 0+2=2).
   - Inner color B unchanged.
   - Frame itself unaffected (unchanged as noted).
   - Consistent only if a frame of color C exists; no cross-frame effects (each frame/inner pair independent).

3. **Frame (color C) + Inner → New Small Components (via color and position)**:
   - Bidirectional with above: Using N from small scattered of color C, exactly N new 1-pixel components (holes=0; pixels=1; bbox single cell, e.g., [7,3,7,3]) of color C (matching frame) are added in output.
   - Position effect: All N new 1px are placed within the inner's bbox (spatial containment; e.g., x 2–10, central y row of inner). Exact x/y varies (not consistent), but always inside inner bounds.
   - These new 1px are separate components (not merged with inner or frame); color C from frame propagates to them.
   - If N=0, no new components added (inner unchanged).

4. **Frame ↔ Inner (spatial and color consistency)**:
   - Frame always spatially encloses inner (inner bbox subset/offset inside frame bbox; consistent offset pattern, e.g., +1 unit margins).
   - Inner color always = background color B (propagation from background; holds input-to-output).
   - No other effects (e.g., frames do not change inners without N from smalls).

#### Notes on Scope and Unknowns
- These interactions cover all changing elements consistently; static elements (e.g., frame pixels=28 fixed) have no interactions.
- No consistent interactions involving: non-C colors of smalls with non-matching frames; background with frames/inners directly (only via smalls); hole counts beyond count-based decrements; pixel sizes of smalls affecting N (N is by component count, not pixel total); or transformations outside these (e.g., no consistent bbox shifts).
- In Train 3 upper, N=0 leads to no change—confirms rule holds even without addition.
- Visual descriptions (e.g., crosses/L-shapes) not identifiable as distinct components in data (all additions are 1px squares); no forced connection.
- Test input follows same component structure (e.g., 4 frames with maroon=B inners, maroon bg, various C smalls), but no output provided for verification.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:50:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color B and multiple rectangular frames (borders) of various colors C, each with empty interiors filled with B. The goal is to remove all small connected components (blobs) of non-background colors scattered in the background areas by setting them to B, count the number N of such small blobs per color C (each component counts as 1 regardless of size), and then restore N pixels of color C inside each corresponding frame's interior on the middle row, placed in the rightmost min(N, 4) of 4 possible every-other-column positions (typically odd-offset columns like 3,5,7,9 relative to the frame start).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are fixed-width (11 columns) rectangles of height 4 or 5, with full top/bottom rows of C, side columns of C on inner rows, and interiors entirely B (if not all B, the frame isn't detected).
 * Small components are 4-directionally connected groups of the same non-B color with size 1-8; components larger than 8 are not removed or counted (likely part of frames or ignored).
 * Counting: Each small component of color C contributes exactly 1 to N for that C, regardless of size or shape—no special doubling for 2x2 squares of size 4 (this overcounts and is a key error in the attempt).
 * Placement inside frame: Only on the middle inner row (for height 5: second inner row; for height 4: first inner row). Use 4 possible slots in the 9-column interior, at relative offsets [1,3,5,7] from the left inner edge (fc+1), resulting in global columns fc+2, fc+4, fc+6, fc+8 (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9 if fc=1). Place C in the rightmost min(N,4) of these slots; leave others as B. Limit to 4 max, even if N>4.
 * Subtlety: All examples show frames starting at column 1 (fc=1), but the code searches for them. Background B is g[0][0], assumed consistent.
 * Subtlety: Removals happen across the entire grid (including any erroneous smalls inside frames, but frames are detected only if inner is all B, so inputs likely have empty inners). No smalls of frame color C are inside frames initially.
 * Easy to miss: Connected components use 4 directions (up, down, left, right); diagonals don't count. Visited array prevents recounting. No removal if size >8 or 0.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs preserve the original frames and background; only smalls are erased, and placements are added only inside detected frames.
 * Potential edge: If no smalls for a C (N=0), inner remains all B. If multiple frames of same C, each gets placements based on total N (code accumulates total small_count[C]).
 * Potential edge: Grid sizes vary slightly (e.g., 23x23 vs. 20x23), but frames are consistent. No frames overlapping or adjacent in examples.
 * The test input has frames for colors 1(odd),2(even),3(odd),4(even) with B=8; placements follow the same odd-column pattern as other examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies B from top-left; simple and reliable.)

```python
def find_frames(g: List[List[int]], B: int) -> List[tuple]:
    # Searches for 11-wide frames of height 4 or 5 with border C and inner all B.
    # Returns list of (C, start_row, start_col, height) for detected frames.
    # Helpful for isolating frames; works well in all examples (detects correctly, as placements happen in right locations).
    # Subtlety: Skips if top-left of potential frame is B; assumes no partial frames.
```
(This function is solid and detects frames accurately based on the rigid structure; key to the puzzle.)

```python
def process_smalls(g: List[List[int]], B: int, out: List[List[int]], frames: List[tuple]) -> dict:
    # Finds and removes (sets to B) all small (<=8 size) connected components of non-B colors using DFS/stack and visited grid.
    # Counts components per color in small_count dict (but current special case for size==4 2x2 adding +2 instead of +1 is broken and causes overcounting).
    # is_special logic for 2x2 squares is unhelpful/broken—not needed; treat all small components as +1.
    # Frames param is unused in function but passed; removal happens globally.
    # Helpful overall for removal and counting, but fix the counting to always +1 per component.
```
(This is mostly helpful for component extraction and removal, but the special case makes it incorrect for counting; remove the is_special and always +1 if not special.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: copies grid to out, gets B, finds frames, processes smalls (removes and counts), then places C pixels in frames based on N. Placement logic (rightmost slots via selected_rel = possible_rel[num_pos - to_fill:]) works well; fixed possible_rel=[1,3,5,7] matches most examples.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection via find_frames worked correctly in all cases (placements occur in expected frame locations and heights).
 * Small component removal worked (outers are cleared to B in outputs).
 * Placement positions worked for training 2 (correct overall) and partially for 1/3 (right number of slots from right, e.g., N=1 at col9, N=4 at 3/5/7/9, N=2 expected at 7/9 but code overplaced due to N error).
 * Counting in process_smalls failed for training 1 and 3: overcounted N for color 4 (placed 4 instead of expected 2 in train1; placed 3 instead of 2 in train3), likely due to broken special case for 2x2 size=4 components adding +2 each instead of +1 (e.g., two 2x2 would give N=4 wrong, should be 2).
 * For training 1: Generated extra inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3 positions) but expected only col7/9 (2); all other frames (2 and 8) matched expected positions and counts.
 * For training 3: Generated inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3) but expected col7/9 (2); color 2 had N=0 correctly (no inner); color 1 had inner 1's at col8/10 (possibly a transcription issue or code bug for odd C, but expected matches printed so may be correct, with mismatch elsewhere minor).
 * Training 2 passed fully, indicating core structure (detection, removal, placement from right) works when counts are accurate.
 * The is_special 2x2 logic is broken/unhelpful (leads to overcount; remove it to fix N).
 * No issues with background detection or grid copying.
 * Potential transcription error in training 3 color1 positions (col8/10 even cols vs. code's odd cols 7/9), but since expected matches printed generated, it may indicate need for parity-based rel (odd C use [2,4,6,8] for even cols 4/6/8/10, rightmost N); however, test uses odd cols for odd C=1/3, so likely always [1,3,5,7] and ex3 print is erroneous.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and consistent with the pattern: removes smalls (assumed), places rightmost N slots in odd inner columns (3,5,7,9) for all frames—e.g., for color 2 (even): 3 placements at col5/7/9 (rightmost 3); color 4 (even): 4 at 3/5/7/9; color 3 (odd): 1 at col9; color 1 (odd): 1 at col9. All in middle rows, frames intact, background 8 preserved.
 * It makes sense as an application of the rules (N=3 for 2, N=4 for 4, N=1 for 3 and 1), but without expected, can't confirm exact counts; positions match the core principle (rightmost every-other from left inner, odd cols). If ex3's even-col placement for odd C=1 is real, test's odd-col for odd C=1/3 doesn't match and would be incorrect—but likely ex3 print error, and test is correct.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 04:50:39] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 04:52:15] Response:
### Consistent Interconnections and Properties Across All Train Examples

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of **only** the obvious, consistent interactions, connections, or effects between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear **in every train example** (1, 2, and 3). I ignored any non-consistent elements (e.g., varying numbers of dots, exact dot positions, background pixel changes, or small object counts/sizes, as they do not uniformly match across all examples). No high-level interpretation or solution is provided. Unknown or non-consistent transformations (e.g., exact mechanism for background hole reduction or small object disappearance triggers) are noted as such. Only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., crosses, L-shapes, or lines not present in data) are excluded.

1. **Frame color → Dot color**: In every output, the 1-pixel dots (h=0, p=1, single-cell bbox) added inside an inner rectangle are always the same color as the enclosing frame (e.g., Yellow frame → Yellow dots; Maroon frame → Maroon dots; Red frame → Red dots; Blue frame → Blue dots; Pink frame → Pink dots). This color matching is consistent for all frames in all examples, regardless of inner or background color.

2. **Frame position/enclosure → Dot position**: Dots (h=0, p=1) in every output are positioned strictly inside the bbox of the inner rectangle enclosed by a frame (e.g., top frame inner bbox contains top dots; middle frame inner contains middle dots). No dots appear outside any inner bbox or interact with non-enclosed areas. This spatial enclosure is consistent for all frames across all examples.

3. **Inner holes + Inner pixels ↔ Number of dots (N)**: In every output, each inner rectangle (initially h=0, p=27) increases its hole count by exactly N (where N ≥ 0 is the number of added 1-pixel dots of frame color) and decreases its pixel count by exactly N (e.g., h=0 p=27 → h=2 p=25 for N=2; h=0 p=27 → h=0 p=27 for N=0). This bidirectional effect (holes gain = pixels loss = N) occurs consistently for every inner rectangle in all examples. (Note: Exact determination of N from input is unknown/ non-consistent across examples, as small object counts and positions vary without uniform mapping.)

4. **Inner color ↔ Background color**: In every input and corresponding output, the color of all inner rectangles matches the color of the background (large h>0 component with full-canvas bbox, e.g., all Blue inners + Blue background; all Maroon inners + Maroon background; all Green inners + Green background). This color equivalence persists unchanged through the transformation in all examples. No cross-coloring occurs.

5. **Frame structure → Inner structure**: In every input and output, each frame (h=1, p=28, rectangular bbox ~10-11 units wide x 4-5 units high) consistently encloses a single inner rectangle (h=0 initially p=27, inset bbox ~9 units wide x 3 units high, same color as background). The frame's bbox remains unchanged in position, size, holes, pixels, and color across all examples. The inner's position and size remain fixed relative to its frame, with only holes and pixels modified as per connection #3.

6. **Small input components → Disappearance**: In every input, small colored components (h=0, p=2-8, small bbox, positioned mostly right-side outside frames) are present. In every corresponding output, all such small components are absent (no matching color/bbox/pixels remain). This total removal is consistent, but the exact trigger (e.g., interaction with specific frames) is unknown/non-consistent, as their positions and counts vary without uniform effect on N (see #3).

7. **Background holes → Reduction**: In every output, the background's hole count decreases (e.g., h=12 → h=3; h=11 → h=3; h=8 → h=3), always reaching exactly h=3 regardless of input value. This reduction effect is consistent across all examples. (Note: Pixel increase is ~+28-30 but not exactly consistent, as values vary slightly; exact cause unknown.)

No other connections (e.g., position → color changes beyond #1; hole count → transform beyond #3; specific small object properties → exact N) are obvious and consistent in **every** example. Elements like tiny dots/markers or lines in inputs do not consistently interact or transform across all cases. For the test input, the same analysis criteria apply, but no new train data is provided to verify consistency.

[2025-10-02 04:52:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnections and Properties Across All Train Examples

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of **only** the obvious, consistent interactions, connections, or effects between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear **in every train example** (1, 2, and 3). I ignored any non-consistent elements (e.g., varying numbers of dots, exact dot positions, background pixel changes, or small object counts/sizes, as they do not uniformly match across all examples). No high-level interpretation or solution is provided. Unknown or non-consistent transformations (e.g., exact mechanism for background hole reduction or small object disappearance triggers) are noted as such. Only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., crosses, L-shapes, or lines not present in data) are excluded.

1. **Frame color → Dot color**: In every output, the 1-pixel dots (h=0, p=1, single-cell bbox) added inside an inner rectangle are always the same color as the enclosing frame (e.g., Yellow frame → Yellow dots; Maroon frame → Maroon dots; Red frame → Red dots; Blue frame → Blue dots; Pink frame → Pink dots). This color matching is consistent for all frames in all examples, regardless of inner or background color.

2. **Frame position/enclosure → Dot position**: Dots (h=0, p=1) in every output are positioned strictly inside the bbox of the inner rectangle enclosed by a frame (e.g., top frame inner bbox contains top dots; middle frame inner contains middle dots). No dots appear outside any inner bbox or interact with non-enclosed areas. This spatial enclosure is consistent for all frames across all examples.

3. **Inner holes + Inner pixels ↔ Number of dots (N)**: In every output, each inner rectangle (initially h=0, p=27) increases its hole count by exactly N (where N ≥ 0 is the number of added 1-pixel dots of frame color) and decreases its pixel count by exactly N (e.g., h=0 p=27 → h=2 p=25 for N=2; h=0 p=27 → h=0 p=27 for N=0). This bidirectional effect (holes gain = pixels loss = N) occurs consistently for every inner rectangle in all examples. (Note: Exact determination of N from input is unknown/ non-consistent across examples, as small object counts and positions vary without uniform mapping.)

4. **Inner color ↔ Background color**: In every input and corresponding output, the color of all inner rectangles matches the color of the background (large h>0 component with full-canvas bbox, e.g., all Blue inners + Blue background; all Maroon inners + Maroon background; all Green inners + Green background). This color equivalence persists unchanged through the transformation in all examples. No cross-coloring occurs.

5. **Frame structure → Inner structure**: In every input and output, each frame (h=1, p=28, rectangular bbox ~10-11 units wide x 4-5 units high) consistently encloses a single inner rectangle (h=0 initially p=27, inset bbox ~9 units wide x 3 units high, same color as background). The frame's bbox remains unchanged in position, size, holes, pixels, and color across all examples. The inner's position and size remain fixed relative to its frame, with only holes and pixels modified as per connection #3.

6. **Small input components → Disappearance**: In every input, small colored components (h=0, p=2-8, small bbox, positioned mostly right-side outside frames) are present. In every corresponding output, all such small components are absent (no matching color/bbox/pixels remain). This total removal is consistent, but the exact trigger (e.g., interaction with specific frames) is unknown/non-consistent, as their positions and counts vary without uniform effect on N (see #3).

7. **Background holes → Reduction**: In every output, the background's hole count decreases (e.g., h=12 → h=3; h=11 → h=3; h=8 → h=3), always reaching exactly h=3 regardless of input value. This reduction effect is consistent across all examples. (Note: Pixel increase is ~+28-30 but not exactly consistent, as values vary slightly; exact cause unknown.)

No other connections (e.g., position → color changes beyond #1; hole count → transform beyond #3; specific small object properties → exact N) are obvious and consistent in **every** example. Elements like tiny dots/markers or lines in inputs do not consistently interact or transform across all cases. For the test input, the same analysis criteria apply, but no new train data is provided to verify consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 05:13:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple embedded "frame" structures (rectangular borders of consistent color, 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, against a uniform background), where each frame contains a unique inner pattern made of the frame's color on background spaces, and the task appears to be cleaning the grid by preserving the full frame borders and their specific inner patterns while removing extraneous non-background elements (noise) outside the frames to produce a clean output with only the frames and their contents.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames always consist of top and bottom rows that are fully uniform in the frame color (11 consecutive cells != background), with vertical sides only on the three inner rows (leftmost and rightmost cells of the frame color), and the immediate inner spaces on those side rows must be background to confirm a valid empty-border structure.
 * Inner patterns (on the three middle rows, especially the center row) vary per frame and represent specific designs (e.g., sparse dots like two isolated color cells, dense alternating color/background like every other cell, or sparser placements like a single offset dot or clustered fills); these must be preserved exactly, not erased or generically replaced.
 * Background color is always g[0][0], and the grid width is odd (23 columns), affecting positioning; frames are non-overlapping and start at column 1 in examples, but detection must scan generally.
 * Noise removal should only target non-background elements outside detected frames (e.g., small disconnected components or artifacts not part of any frame); blindly erasing all non-marked non-background cells destroys valid inner patterns.
 * Subtlety: Detection assumes inner rows (dr=1 to 3) have all inner cells (j=1 to 9) as background during detection, which works for empty frames but fails if patterns exist in input (as they do); this means detection must happen before patterns are present or use a different approach to identify frames without requiring empty inners.
 * Frames may have borders that blend with adjacent background in some cases (e.g., extra background cells around), but the uniform 11-cell top/bottom is key.
 * Patterns are only on the middle row in many cases (r_start + 2), but side rows may have fills (e.g., in train2, side inners have color fills extending from borders).
 * Easy to miss: Inner patterns can connect to borders in input (e.g., touching sides), so removal logic must avoid flood-fill or connectivity checks that could erase them; also, multiple frames per grid, with varying colors (2,4,8,1,3,6).
 * Overall goal seems to "complete" or clean frames by ensuring borders are solid and inners are as per some rule (possibly Morse-like or binary representation), but examples suggest preserving input patterns while zeroing external noise.
 * Grid height ~23-28 rows, with empty background rows separating frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg and is useful; no issues.)

```python
def is_uniform(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start: int, length: int, color: int) -> bool:
    for j in range(start, start + length):
        if g[r][j] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This is helpful for checking solid border lines; accurate and reusable for top/bottom detection.)

```python
def detect_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    frames = []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows - 4):
        for start in range(cols - 10):
            color = g[r][start]
            if color != bg and is_uniform(g, r, start, 11, color):
                if is_uniform(g, r + 4, start, 11, color):
                    good = True
                    for dr in range(1, 4):
                        rr = r + dr
                        if g[rr][start] != color or g[rr][start + 10] != color:
                            good = False
                            break
                        for j in range(1, 10):
                            if g[rr][start + j] != bg:
                                good = False
                                break
                        if not good:
                            break
                    if good:
                        frames.append((r, start, color))
    return frames
```
(This detects frame positions and colors accurately when inners are empty during check, but breaks on inputs with pre-existing patterns since it requires inner rows to be all bg; partially helpful but needs modification to ignore inner non-bg for detection or detect after masking.)

```python
def mark_borders(g: List[List[int]], frames: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[bool]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    marked = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    for r_start, c_start, _ in frames:
        for j in range(c_start, c_start + 11):
            marked[r_start][j] = True
            marked[r_start + 4][j] = True
        for dr in range(1, 4):
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start] = True
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start + 10] = True
    return marked
```
(This correctly marks only borders; useful for protecting frame outlines during cleanup, but does not mark inner patterns, which is good if we want to preserve them separately.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Detection of frames works partially (e.g., identifies positions and colors for simple cases like train1 first frame), but fails for cases where inner patterns exist during detection (e.g., train2 and train3, where non-bg in middle rows prevents 'good=True').
 * Removal logic (remove_small_components) erases all non-border non-bg cells, including valid inner patterns, leading to empty inners in output; this destroys the puzzle's core (preserving patterns) and is a major flaw.
 * add_dots function adds generic 2 dots per frame in fixed positions (columns ~7 and 9 relative to left inner, on middle row), which coincidentally matches train1 first frame's sparse pattern but fails for dense/alternating patterns (e.g., train1 second frame missing full 1-8-1-8... alternation, only has sparse 8's at ~7,9,11) and sparser ones (e.g., train1 third frame missing the single offset 2 at col9, adds wrong ones at 7 and 9).
 * In train1: First frame correct by coincidence (dots match expected sparse pattern), but second frame incorrect (generated has isolated 8's at col7,9,11 on middle row instead of full alternating 8-1 across col1-11); third frame incorrect (no inner 2's added on middle row, expected single 2 at col9).
 * In train2: Detection likely failed for all frames (tops/bottoms not fully uniform color due to mixed borders/inners, e.g., top row2 has 8 borders + 1 inners, not uniform 1), so no marking/removal/add, output keeps input as-is with noise; differs from expected where inners are cleaned to specific patterns (e.g., middle row4 has 1 at col10 and col12 misplaced? Expected has 1's only at sides and specific inner spots, but generated has extra 1's and wrong 8 placements in sides).
 * In train3: Similar detection issues (e.g., first frame's middle row has inner 2's, failing uniformity check on inners==bg); generated keeps some inners but incorrectly (e.g., third frame middle row has 1's everywhere inner, expected has isolated 1 at col9); second frame middle row generated [3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,4,3,...] has sparse 4's, expected full alternating 4-3-4...).
 * Overall, no training example fully correct; program understands frame structure but mishandles preservation (erases inners, adds wrong generic dots).
 * Function remove_small_components is broken for this puzzle (erases valid content, not just small/external noise; do not use as-is, needs connectivity check or frame-containment logic).
 * Function add_dots is unhelpful/not relevant (assumes generic dots, ignores unique patterns; discard for future, as patterns seem input-derived or rule-based like binary/Morse).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have detected some frames (borders preserved for all four: 2's at top, 4's, 3's, 1's at bottom) but erased most inner patterns and added incorrect sparse dots (e.g., for top 2's frame, middle row3 has 2's at col7,9,11 but expected likely full or different pattern like alternating or clustered based on training style; similarly for 4's middle row9: 4's at col7,9,11 sparse, but training shows denser for similar colors; 3's and 1's have similar sparse adds missing expected sparser/single placements).
 * Extra background rows at bottom are clean (good), but inners are overly simplified/erased (e.g., no dense fills seen in train2 style), and some side rows have lingering 8's that should be bg if noise; does not match expected clean preservation of unique patterns per frame.
 * To handle test, need to preserve input inners within frame bounds (e.g., mark entire frame rect including inners, then remove only external non-bg); current output looks like partial erasure + wrong adds, leaving incomplete patterns.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in *every* train example, without speculation on unresolved aspects (e.g., exact pixel count changes in the background or positions of unused small components). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., small components of colors without matching frames, which do not appear to interact consistently; background pixel increases, which vary slightly; or symbolic interpretations of small component shapes) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., why background holes always reduce to exactly 3, or how unused small components are handled) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Small Filled Squares (Low-Pixel Components) → Colored Rectangular Frames (Hole=1, Pixels≈28 Components)**
   - **Interaction**: The count of small filled squares (components with small bounding boxes, e.g., width/height ≤3, pixels 2–8, holes=0) of a specific color directly determines the number of new 1x1 single-pixel squares (holes=0, pixels=1, same color) added inside the matching colored rectangular frame.
     - Consistent across all trains: One small filled square per color → 1 new 1x1 square; 2 small filled squares → 2 new 1x1 squares; 3 small filled squares → 3 new 1x1 squares; 4 small filled squares → 4 new 1x1 squares.
     - Only small filled squares matching a frame's color interact this way; non-matching colors (e.g., green smalls in train 1 and 2) have no observed consistent effect on any frame.
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Color: Preserved (small square color = new 1x1 color = frame color).
     - Position: New 1x1 squares are placed inside the frame's bounding box, specifically along the central horizontal row of the frame's interior (e.g., y=3 for frames with y-range 1–5; y=9/10/15/16 for y-ranges 7–11/8–12/13–17/14–18). Horizontal x-positions are spaced evenly within the interior (e.g., starting from x=3/6 and incrementing by 2, up to the number needed; exact starting offset varies consistently by frame bbox x-start: x=1-start uses odd offsets like 3/5/7/9; x=2-start uses even offsets like 6/8/10).
   - **Consistency Note**: This interaction occurs only if a frame of the matching color exists; no transformation happens without a frame (e.g., no red frame in train 3 → no red 1x1 squares added).

#### 2. **New 1x1 Single-Pixel Squares Inside Frames → Internal Filled Regions (Pixels=27, Holes=0 Initially Components)**
   - **Interaction**: Each new 1x1 square added inside a frame directly modifies the frame's internal filled region (the adjacent large component with pixels=27, holes=0, bounding box nested inside the frame, color matching the background).
     - The number of 1x1 squares = increase in holes for the internal region = decrease in pixels for the internal region (e.g., 0 new 1x1 → holes remain 0, pixels remain 27; 1 new 1x1 → holes=1, pixels=26; 2 new 1x1 → holes=2, pixels=25; etc.).
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Holes: Increased by exactly the number of 1x1 squares (consistent additive transformation).
     - Pixels: Decreased by exactly the number of 1x1 squares (consistent subtractive transformation; assumes 1x1 squares "punch" into the filled region).
     - Position/Bounding Box: Internal region's bbox remains unchanged, but now fully contains the positions of the 1x1 squares.
     - Color: Internal region color unchanged (always matches background color: blue in train 1, maroon in train 2, green in train 3).
   - **Consistency Note**: No internal changes occur without matching small filled squares (e.g., red frame in train 3 has 0 small reds → internal unchanged).

#### 3. **Colored Rectangular Frames ↔ Internal Filled Regions (Mutual Containment)**
   - **Interaction**: Frames and their internal filled regions are positionally interconnected, with the internal always nested inside the frame's bounding box (e.g., frame [1,1,11,5] contains internal [2,2,10,4]; frame [2,8,12,12] contains [3,9,11,11]).
     - This nesting is static: Frames and internals retain identical bounding boxes and pixel counts (≈28 for frames, 27 for internals) across input-to-output, except for the hole/pixel changes in internals noted above.
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Position: Strict containment (internal bbox is inset by 1 unit on all sides from frame bbox).
     - Holes (Frame): Always=1 (enclosing the internal region); unchanged.
     - Color: Frame color differs from internal color (internal always matches background); no color swap or change.

#### 4. **All Above Elements → Background (Large Hole>0, Full-Grid Bounding Box Component)**
   - **Interaction**: The cumulative effects from small filled squares → frames → internals indirectly affect the background (the largest component with bbox covering nearly the full grid, e.g., [0,0,22,22] or [0,0,22,19], color matching internals, high initial holes ≈8–12, pixels ≈265–337).
     - Holes: Reduced to exactly 3 in every output (from initial 8–12), regardless of the number of small filled squares or frames affected. (Unknown: Exact mechanism, as reduction is fixed rather than tied to a variable count like 1x1 squares.)
     - Pixels: Increased in every output (e.g., +27 to +30), potentially by absorbing pixels from transformed small filled squares or filling prior background holes, but exact delta varies slightly and is not tied consistently to a single property (e.g., not exactly equal to total small pixels removed).
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Holes: Set to 3 (consistent fixed transformation).
     - Pixels: Increased (directionally consistent, but magnitude unknown/ variable).
     - Color: Unchanged (matches internal filled regions).
     - Position/Bounding Box: Unchanged (remains full-grid coverage).
   - **Consistency Note**: This is a one-way effect (foreground changes drive background updates), but the hole reduction is the only fully consistent, obvious part; pixel increase is directional but not precisely quantifiable across examples.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no evidence of color-to-position transformations beyond frame nesting, no consistent effects from non-frame-matching smalls, no hole-to-color links). Elements like the exact spacing of 1x1 x-positions within frames follow a pattern but are not transformative (just placement rules). The test input was not analyzed for interactions, as the task focuses on train consistency.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in *every* train example, without speculation on unresolved aspects (e.g., exact pixel count changes in the background or positions of unused small components). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., small components of colors without matching frames, which do not appear to interact consistently; background pixel increases, which vary slightly; or symbolic interpretations of small component shapes) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., why background holes always reduce to exactly 3, or how unused small components are handled) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Small Filled Squares (Low-Pixel Components) → Colored Rectangular Frames (Hole=1, Pixels≈28 Components)**
   - **Interaction**: The count of small filled squares (components with small bounding boxes, e.g., width/height ≤3, pixels 2–8, holes=0) of a specific color directly determines the number of new 1x1 single-pixel squares (holes=0, pixels=1, same color) added inside the matching colored rectangular frame.
     - Consistent across all trains: One small filled square per color → 1 new 1x1 square; 2 small filled squares → 2 new 1x1 squares; 3 small filled squares → 3 new 1x1 squares; 4 small filled squares → 4 new 1x1 squares.
     - Only small filled squares matching a frame's color interact this way; non-matching colors (e.g., green smalls in train 1 and 2) have no observed consistent effect on any frame.
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Color: Preserved (small square color = new 1x1 color = frame color).
     - Position: New 1x1 squares are placed inside the frame's bounding box, specifically along the central horizontal row of the frame's interior (e.g., y=3 for frames with y-range 1–5; y=9/10/15/16 for y-ranges 7–11/8–12/13–17/14–18). Horizontal x-positions are spaced evenly within the interior (e.g., starting from x=3/6 and incrementing by 2, up to the number needed; exact starting offset varies consistently by frame bbox x-start: x=1-start uses odd offsets like 3/5/7/9; x=2-start uses even offsets like 6/8/10).
   - **Consistency Note**: This interaction occurs only if a frame of the matching color exists; no transformation happens without a frame (e.g., no red frame in train 3 → no red 1x1 squares added).

#### 2. **New 1x1 Single-Pixel Squares Inside Frames → Internal Filled Regions (Pixels=27, Holes=0 Initially Components)**
   - **Interaction**: Each new 1x1 square added inside a frame directly modifies the frame's internal filled region (the adjacent large component with pixels=27, holes=0, bounding box nested inside the frame, color matching the background).
     - The number of 1x1 squares = increase in holes for the internal region = decrease in pixels for the internal region (e.g., 0 new 1x1 → holes remain 0, pixels remain 27; 1 new 1x1 → holes=1, pixels=26; 2 new 1x1 → holes=2, pixels=25; etc.).
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Holes: Increased by exactly the number of 1x1 squares (consistent additive transformation).
     - Pixels: Decreased by exactly the number of 1x1 squares (consistent subtractive transformation; assumes 1x1 squares "punch" into the filled region).
     - Position/Bounding Box: Internal region's bbox remains unchanged, but now fully contains the positions of the 1x1 squares.
     - Color: Internal region color unchanged (always matches background color: blue in train 1, maroon in train 2, green in train 3).
   - **Consistency Note**: No internal changes occur without matching small filled squares (e.g., red frame in train 3 has 0 small reds → internal unchanged).

#### 3. **Colored Rectangular Frames ↔ Internal Filled Regions (Mutual Containment)**
   - **Interaction**: Frames and their internal filled regions are positionally interconnected, with the internal always nested inside the frame's bounding box (e.g., frame [1,1,11,5] contains internal [2,2,10,4]; frame [2,8,12,12] contains [3,9,11,11]).
     - This nesting is static: Frames and internals retain identical bounding boxes and pixel counts (≈28 for frames, 27 for internals) across input-to-output, except for the hole/pixel changes in internals noted above.
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Position: Strict containment (internal bbox is inset by 1 unit on all sides from frame bbox).
     - Holes (Frame): Always=1 (enclosing the internal region); unchanged.
     - Color: Frame color differs from internal color (internal always matches background); no color swap or change.

#### 4. **All Above Elements → Background (Large Hole>0, Full-Grid Bounding Box Component)**
   - **Interaction**: The cumulative effects from small filled squares → frames → internals indirectly affect the background (the largest component with bbox covering nearly the full grid, e.g., [0,0,22,22] or [0,0,22,19], color matching internals, high initial holes ≈8–12, pixels ≈265–337).
     - Holes: Reduced to exactly 3 in every output (from initial 8–12), regardless of the number of small filled squares or frames affected. (Unknown: Exact mechanism, as reduction is fixed rather than tied to a variable count like 1x1 squares.)
     - Pixels: Increased in every output (e.g., +27 to +30), potentially by absorbing pixels from transformed small filled squares or filling prior background holes, but exact delta varies slightly and is not tied consistently to a single property (e.g., not exactly equal to total small pixels removed).
   - **Properties Affected**:
     - Holes: Set to 3 (consistent fixed transformation).
     - Pixels: Increased (directionally consistent, but magnitude unknown/ variable).
     - Color: Unchanged (matches internal filled regions).
     - Position/Bounding Box: Unchanged (remains full-grid coverage).
   - **Consistency Note**: This is a one-way effect (foreground changes drive background updates), but the hole reduction is the only fully consistent, obvious part; pixel increase is directional but not precisely quantifiable across examples.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no evidence of color-to-position transformations beyond frame nesting, no consistent effects from non-frame-matching smalls, no hole-to-color links). Elements like the exact spacing of 1x1 x-positions within frames follow a pattern but are not transformative (just placement rules). The test input was not analyzed for interactions, as the task focuses on train consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

[2025-10-02 05:32:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x23 grid (or similar dimensions) where the goal is to identify specific "frame" structures (hollow 5x11 rectangles of a single color with a fully background-filled 3x9 interior) made of non-background colors, erase all other non-background elements (treating them as noise or irrelevant components), and then repopulate the middle row of each frame's interior with a specific number of 1x1 "dots" of the frame's color. The number of dots (n) is determined by counting small connected components (1-8 cells, with bonuses for 2x2 or 3x3 filled squares) of the same color elsewhere in the grid, and the dots are placed right-aligned in the interior columns (1-9 relative to frame left), preferring opposite-parity columns to the frame's right edge first, then same-parity if needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the color in the top-left cell (e.g., 1 in training 1/2, 3 in training 3, 8 in test); all processing ignores it.
 * Frames must be exactly 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, with 25-30 cells total (hollow border), and the exact 3x9 interior (rows t+1 to t+3, cols l+1 to l+9) must be entirely background—no partial fills or leaks.
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), strictly same-color; frames are identified as the large border components meeting size/bbox/internal criteria.
 * For n (dots to place): Base count is number of small components (1-8 cells) of color c outside the frame; add (size-1) extra for each fully filled square component of 2x2 (add 1) or 3x3 (add 2). This seems to represent "values" or "morse-like" encodings from small blobs elsewhere.
 * Placement: In the frame's middle interior row (t+2), place n dots of color c in columns l+1 to l+9, right-aligned (highest columns first). Prioritize columns with parity opposite to the frame's right edge column (iright % 2), taking the rightmost n such; if n exceeds available opposite-parity slots (up to 5), spill to rightmost same-parity columns. No overlaps or extensions beyond interior.
 * All other non-background cells (not in any frame) must be erased to background before placing dots; frames themselves remain intact.
 * Subtleties: Parity-based placement ensures "alternating" or "gapped" positioning to match visual patterns (e.g., avoiding adjacent dots if possible); small components might be single cells, lines, or squares, but only filled squares get bonuses—irregular shapes count as 1 regardless of size (1-8). Frames don't overlap or nest. Grid edges are all background except frames. No rotation or diagonal connections. The middle row is always row index t+2 (0-based).
 * Easy to miss: Internal check must be exactly 27 background cells (3*9); frames might have slight variations in border thickness but must fit exact bbox. Counting skips the frame itself when tallying small components for n. Placement can leave gaps if n < 9, but always right-justified with parity preference. Background fill happens after component detection but before dot placement. Test grids may have more frames (4 in test vs. 3 in trainings) and different color orders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
from collections import defaultdict

def get_background_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color from the top-left cell."""
    return grid[0][0]
```
(This is correct and essential; assumes uniform background.)

```python
def find_all_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    """Find all 4-connected components of non-background cells."""
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    all_comps = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and grid[i][j] != bg:
                c = grid[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == c:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                all_comps.append((c, component))
    return all_comps
```
(This is helpful and correct; uses DFS stack for 4-connected same-color components, essential for extracting all objects/frames.)

```python
def identify_frames(all_comps: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]], grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    """Identify frame components based on size, bbox, and internal background fill."""
    frames = []
    for c, comp in all_comps:
        if len(comp) < 25 or len(comp) > 30:
            continue
        min_i = min(p[0] for p in comp)
        max_i = max(p[0] for p in comp)
        min_j = min(p[1] for p in comp)
        max_j = max(p[1] for p in comp)
        h = max_i - min_i + 1
        w = max_j - min_j + 1
        if h != 5 or w != 11:
            continue
        # Check internal 3x9 all bg
        internal_count = 0
        for ii in range(min_i + 1, min_i + 4):
            for jj in range(min_j + 1, min_j + 10):
                if grid[ii][jj] == bg:
                    internal_count += 1
        if internal_count == 27:
            t = min_i
            l = min_j
            m = t + 2
            frames.append((t, l, c, m, comp))
    return frames
```
(This is mostly helpful; correctly identifies frames by size, bbox, and exact internal background count (27 cells). Minor issue: internal loop uses min_j +10, which is correct for 9 cols (1 to 9), but ensure no border bleed.)

```python
def fill_non_frame_cells(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, frame_cells: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all non-background cells not part of frames with background color."""
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    output = [row[:] for row in grid]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != bg and (i, j) not in frame_cells:
                output[i][j] = bg
    return output
```
(This is helpful and correct; clears noise while preserving frames, using a set for fast lookup—essential step before dot placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identified frames in all training examples (correct 5x11 bbox, size 25-30, full internal bg) and cleared non-frame cells to background, preserving frame borders intact.
 * Correctly grouped components by color using defaultdict(list), skipping the frame itself when counting small components for n.
 * Training example 2 passed fully, indicating the logic works for some patterns (likely where n=0 or simple right-aligned placement without spillover).
 * Failed in training 1: For color 4 frame (rows 1-5, cols 1-11), generated middle row (row 3) as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11? shifted left] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3 positions?]; for color 8 (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,8] (dense left with extras) vs expected [1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8] (alternating starting from col 1, 6 dots). Suggests n overcounted (too many dots) and/or wrong columns selected (not parity-preferred right-aligned).
 * Failed in training 3: For color 4 frame (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11—shifted] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3]; for color 1 (rows 13-17), generated row 15 as [1 at cols 7,9,11—only 3] but expected has 1 at cols 7,9,11 (wait, appears similar, but actual diff is in row 15 matching but perhaps n=3 correct while earlier frames wrong); overall, placement shifted left, ignoring parity (e.g., if iright even, prefer odd cols rightmost).
 * compute_n_for_color overcounts or miscounts small components: Counts all 1-8 cell comps as +1, and filled 2x2/3x3 as +(ww-1), but in training 1 for color 8, there might be small blobs worth n=6 (alternating), but generated placed 8+ incorrectly; unknown if bonuses applied wrong (e.g., treating lines as squares).
 * get_placement_columns has parity logic but buggy: For iright even (e.g., l+10 even if l even), opp_par=odd, takes rightmost n odds (e.g., 9,7,5,...), but in generated, it places in even cols or leftward, suggesting wrong sorting or spillover (poss_opp[-n:] takes last n, which are rightmost if list is left-to-right).
 * program main flow is solid (bg -> comps -> frames -> group by color -> clear noise -> place dots per frame), but dot placement fails due to n miscalculation and column selection errors.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, but compute_n_for_color and get_placement_columns need fixes (e.g., verify filled square detection: check if hh==ww and pp==hh*ww and 2<=ww<=3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 4 frames (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23), clears all noise (e.g., no stray cells outside frames), and preserves borders, with background 8 everywhere else. However, interior fillings are wrong or incomplete: For color 2 (n likely 0, no small 2-blobs elsewhere), middle row 3 is all bg—correct (empty). For color 4 (row 9), generated [4,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,4] (dense with left bias, 6+ dots?) vs likely expected alternating right-aligned (e.g., 4 at cols 1,3,5,7,9 or rightmost 5 if n=5, but pattern looks like overcounted n=6 without parity, placing adjacently). For color 3 (row 15), [3 at col 9 only? sparse] suggests undercounted n=1, but if small 3-blobs exist (e.g., single or 2x2), expected might need 2-3 rightmost opposite-parity. For color 1 (row 21), [1 at cols 9,11? but extended] looks like n=2 but wrong columns (should be rightmost, e.g., 8+1=9 if odd preferred). Overall, placements are not right-aligned with parity (e.g., favors left/even cols), leading to non-alternating patterns; does not match visual consistency of trainings (e.g., expected would have gapped, right-heavy dots). Missing: Proper spillover handling if n>5, and exact n from small comps (test has potential 2x2/3x3 bonuses unseen).

[2025-10-02 05:32:32] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties Across All Train Examples

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** example. These are limited to properties and components that reliably interact or affect each other (e.g., via color matching, position adjacency implied by bbox overlap or proximity, count-based transformations, pixel/hole changes). Only elements with direct, consistent effects are included—no high-level puzzle solving, no irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., non-interacting shapes without frame matches), no forced connections (e.g., no semantic meaning assumed for shapes like plus signs or L-shapes, as they are not present in the data). Unknowns (e.g., exact spacing logic for tiny positions beyond "centered") are noted as such.

#### 1. **Color-Matched Small Filled Shapes → Rectangular Frames → Inner Filled Shapes**
   - **Components Involved**: Small filled shapes (holes=0, small bbox like [15,1,16,2], pixels ≥2, various colors), rectangular outline frames (holes=1, large bbox like [1,1,11,5], pixels=28, colors: yellow, maroon, red, blue, pink, green), inner filled shapes (holes=0 initially, bbox nested inside frame like [2,2,10,4], pixels=27, color matching background).
   - **Connection/Interaction**:
     - Small shapes of color C only interact if a frame of exact same color C exists (consistent: non-matching smalls like green in train 1/2 have no effect on any frame/inner).
     - Position effect: Small shapes with bbox adjacent or near (e.g., x=14-21, y overlapping frame's y-range) to a color-C frame enable interaction; no interaction if no such frame (e.g., maroon small in train 3 ignored).
     - Transformation: Each small shape of color C transforms into exactly 1 tiny single-pixel dot (holes=0, bbox single point like [7,3,7,3], pixels=1, color C) inside the inner shape of the matching color-C frame.
       - Count consistency: Number of tiny dots of color C = exact number of small shapes of color C (e.g., 4 small maroons → 4 tiny maroons in train 1; 3 small pinks → 3 tiny pinks in train 2; 2 small yellows → 2 tiny yellows in train 3).
     - Effect on inner shape (consistent across all): Inner of matching frame gains +1 hole and -1 pixel per tiny dot (color of inner unchanged; e.g., 0→4 holes and 27→23 pixels for 4 tinies in train 1 middle inner; no change if no matching smalls, e.g., top inner in train 3).
     - Position effect on tinies: Tiny dots placed inside inner's bbox, horizontally centered (x around inner's x-center like 6-7), at vertical center (y = inner's y-center); spaced evenly horizontally (e.g., every 2 units for N>1). Exact spacing offset unknown (consistent pattern but not fully explainable from data).
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Interacting**: Small shapes without color match to any frame are removed without creating tinies or affecting inners (e.g., all greens/reds in train 2; maroon in train 3).

#### 2. **All Small Filled Shapes → Background**
   - **Components Involved**: All small filled shapes (as above, regardless of color match), background (holes= many like 8-14, large bbox like [0,0,22,22], pixels < max possible, color matching inners: blue in train 1, maroon in train 2, green in train 3).
   - **Connection/Interaction**:
     - All small shapes (matching or non-matching) are fully removed (disappear from output; consistent: no smalls remain outside in any output).
     - Pixel transfer: Total pixels from all removed smalls contribute to background (+ total small pixels across all examples: +28 in train 1, +27 in train 2, +30 in train 3).
     - Adjustment for interacting smalls: For each interacting small (color-matched, creating a tiny), subtract 1 pixel (the tiny's pixel) from the transfer; remainder goes to background (consistent: e.g., 7 interacting smalls in train 1 → -7 from smalls' total for tinies, but full small pixels still net + to bg after other effects).
     - Color consistency: Background color unchanged and always matches inner shapes' color (no transformation effect).
   - **No Connection**: Background color does not affect smalls or frames; isolated smalls without frames still transfer pixels fully (no tiny created).

#### 3. **Inner Filled Shapes → Background (via Hole/Pixel Loss)**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner filled shapes (as above), background (as above).
   - **Connection/Interaction**:
     - Pixel loss from inners (only from +holes/-pixels due to tinies) transfers directly to background (+1 pixel to bg per 1 pixel lost from any inner; consistent: total inner losses = total new holes across all inners, e.g., +7 to bg from inners in train 1 matching smalls' tiny count).
     - Hole effect on background: Background holes decrease by amount related to total transfers (e.g., 12→3 in train 1, decrease=9; 11→3 in train 2, decrease=8; 8→3 in train 3, decrease=5), but exact formula unknown (consistent decrease but not fully explainable; always ends at holes=3 in these examples? Uncertain beyond trend).
     - Position: No direct position interaction; effect is global pixel/hole count change.
   - **No Effect if No Loss**: Unchanged inners (no matching smalls) cause 0 transfer (e.g., top inner in train 3).

#### 4. **General Consistent Properties (No Isolated Elements)**
   - **Frames Overall**: All frames (outlines) remain completely unchanged (holes=1, pixels=28, bbox, color fixed; no interaction with non-matching elements; e.g., yellow frame in train 1 unaffected by maroon smalls).
   - **Pixel Conservation**: Total pixels across all components conserved (input sum = output sum: 529 in trains 1/2, 460 in train 3); enforced by transfers above (smalls + inner losses → bg; tinies offset inner losses).
   - **Hole Count Consistency**: Only inners and background have hole changes; frames fixed at holes=1; smalls/tinies always holes=0.
   - **Structural Stack**: Three frames consistently stacked vertically (y-ranges [1-5], [7-11], [13-17]), each with nested inner; background encloses all (bbox [0,0,22,*]); smalls positioned outside/adjacent (x=14-21).
   - **Unknowns/Non-Forced**:
     - Exact tiny x-spacing logic (e.g., why [7,3] and [9,3] vs. [8,16] and [10,16]): Consistent centering but offset varies slightly; not explainable without more data.
     - Background final holes (often 3, but why?): Decreases consistently with transfers, but precise calc unknown.
     - No connections for: Pixels >1 in smalls (not preserved beyond count); specific small bbox sizes (only count matters); any semantic shape meaning (e.g., no plus/L/bar in data); inconsistent elements (none found).

These are the only obvious, consistent interactions; no other components (e.g., no plus signs or bars in data) show effects across all examples. Non-interacting elements (e.g., unmatched smalls) only connect via pixel transfer to background.

[2025-10-02 05:36:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple embedded "frame" structures (rectangular borders of consistent color, 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, against a uniform background), where each frame contains a unique inner pattern made of the frame's color on background spaces, and the task appears to be cleaning the grid by preserving the full frame borders and their specific inner patterns while removing extraneous non-background elements (noise) outside the frames to produce a clean output with only the frames and their contents.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames always consist of top and bottom rows that are fully uniform in the frame color (11 consecutive cells != background), with vertical sides only on the three inner rows (leftmost and rightmost cells of the frame color), and the immediate inner spaces on those side rows must be background to confirm a valid empty-border structure.
 * Inner patterns (on the three middle rows, especially the center row) vary per frame and represent specific designs (e.g., sparse dots like two isolated color cells, dense alternating color/background like every other cell, or sparser placements like a single offset dot or clustered fills); these must be preserved exactly, not erased or generically replaced.
 * Background color is always g[0][0], and the grid width is odd (23 columns), affecting positioning; frames are non-overlapping and start at column 1 in examples, but detection must scan generally.
 * Noise removal should only target non-background elements outside detected frames (e.g., small disconnected components or artifacts not part of any frame); blindly erasing all non-marked non-background cells destroys valid inner patterns.
 * Subtlety: Detection assumes inner rows (dr=1 to 3) have all inner cells (j=1 to 9) as background during detection, which works for empty frames but fails if patterns exist in input (as they do); this means detection must happen before patterns are present or use a different approach to identify frames without requiring empty inners.
 * Frames may have borders that blend with adjacent background in some cases (e.g., extra background cells around), but the uniform 11-cell top/bottom is key.
 * Patterns are only on the middle row in many cases (r_start + 2), but side rows may have fills (e.g., in train2, side inners have color fills extending from borders).
 * Easy to miss: Inner patterns can connect to borders in input (e.g., touching sides), so removal logic must avoid flood-fill or connectivity checks that could erase them; also, multiple frames per grid, with varying colors (2,4,8,1,3,6).
 * Overall goal seems to "complete" or clean frames by ensuring borders are solid and inners are as per some rule (possibly Morse-like or binary representation), but examples suggest preserving input patterns while zeroing external noise.
 * Grid height ~23-28 rows, with empty background rows separating frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg and is useful; no issues.)

```python
def is_uniform(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start: int, length: int, color: int) -> bool:
    for j in range(start, start + length):
        if g[r][j] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This is helpful for checking solid border lines; accurate and reusable for top/bottom detection.)

```python
def detect_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    frames = []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows - 4):
        for start in range(cols - 10):
            color = g[r][start]
            if color != bg and is_uniform(g, r, start, 11, color):
                if is_uniform(g, r + 4, start, 11, color):
                    good = True
                    for dr in range(1, 4):
                        rr = r + dr
                        if g[rr][start] != color or g[rr][start + 10] != color:
                            good = False
                            break
                        for j in range(1, 10):
                            if g[rr][start + j] != bg:
                                good = False
                                break
                        if not good:
                            break
                    if good:
                        frames.append((r, start, color))
    return frames
```
(This detects frame positions and colors accurately when inners are empty during check, but breaks on inputs with pre-existing patterns since it requires inner rows to be all bg; partially helpful but needs modification to ignore inner non-bg for detection or detect after masking.)

```python
def mark_borders(g: List[List[int]], frames: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[bool]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    marked = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    for r_start, c_start, _ in frames:
        for j in range(c_start, c_start + 11):
            marked[r_start][j] = True
            marked[r_start + 4][j] = True
        for dr in range(1, 4):
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start] = True
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start + 10] = True
    return marked
```
(This correctly marks only borders; useful for protecting frame outlines during cleanup, but does not mark inner patterns, which is good if we want to preserve them separately.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Detection of frames works partially (e.g., identifies positions and colors for simple cases like train1 first frame), but fails for cases where inner patterns exist during detection (e.g., train2 and train3, where non-bg in middle rows prevents 'good=True').
 * Removal logic (remove_small_components) erases all non-border non-bg cells, including valid inner patterns, leading to empty inners in output; this destroys the puzzle's core (preserving patterns) and is a major flaw.
 * add_dots function adds generic 2 dots per frame in fixed positions (columns ~7 and 9 relative to left inner, on middle row), which coincidentally matches train1 first frame's sparse pattern but fails for dense/alternating patterns (e.g., train1 second frame missing full 1-8-1-8... alternation, only has sparse 8's at ~7,9,11) and sparser ones (e.g., train1 third frame missing the single offset 2 at col9, adds wrong ones at 7 and 9).
 * In train1: First frame correct by coincidence (dots match expected sparse pattern), but second frame incorrect (generated has isolated 8's at col7,9,11 on middle row instead of full alternating 8-1 across col1-11); third frame incorrect (no inner 2's added on middle row, expected single 2 at col9).
 * In train2: Detection likely failed for all frames (tops/bottoms not fully uniform color due to mixed borders/inners, e.g., top row2 has 8 borders + 1 inners, not uniform 1), so no marking/removal/add, output keeps input as-is with noise; differs from expected where inners are cleaned to specific patterns (e.g., middle row4 has 1 at col10 and col12 misplaced? Expected has 1's only at sides and specific inner spots, but generated has extra 1's and wrong 8 placements in sides).
 * In train3: Similar detection issues (e.g., first frame's middle row has inner 2's, failing uniformity check on inners==bg); generated keeps some inners but incorrectly (e.g., third frame middle row has 1's everywhere inner, expected has isolated 1 at col9); second frame middle row generated [3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,4,3,...] has sparse 4's, expected full alternating 4-3-4...).
 * Overall, no training example fully correct; program understands frame structure but mishandles preservation (erases inners, adds wrong generic dots).
 * Function remove_small_components is broken for this puzzle (erases valid content, not just small/external noise; do not use as-is, needs connectivity check or frame-containment logic).
 * Function add_dots is unhelpful/not relevant (assumes generic dots, ignores unique patterns; discard for future, as patterns seem input-derived or rule-based like binary/Morse).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have detected some frames (borders preserved for all four: 2's at top, 4's, 3's, 1's at bottom) but erased most inner patterns and added incorrect sparse dots (e.g., for top 2's frame, middle row3 has 2's at col7,9,11 but expected likely full or different pattern like alternating or clustered based on training style; similarly for 4's middle row9: 4's at col7,9,11 sparse, but training shows denser for similar colors; 3's and 1's have similar sparse adds missing expected sparser/single placements).
 * Extra background rows at bottom are clean (good), but inners are overly simplified/erased (e.g., no dense fills seen in train2 style), and some side rows have lingering 8's that should be bg if noise; does not match expected clean preservation of unique patterns per frame.
 * To handle test, need to preserve input inners within frame bounds (e.g., mark entire frame rect including inners, then remove only external non-bg); current output looks like partial erasure + wrong adds, leaving incomplete patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain partial or outlined "symbols" (likely letters or shapes) formed by aligned vertical "legs" (spans of the same non-background color) in three consecutive rows, flanked by full top and bottom bars of the same color; the program must detect these alignments and complete the 5-row-high symbol by filling specific internal patterns unique to each color (1,2,3,4,6,8), while removing any small disconnected components at the end. The background color is the most common in the grid, and symbols are drawn on a background-filled output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Symbols span exactly 5 rows: a full top bar (row s), three rows of "legs" (rows s+1 to s+3, where legs are vertical non-background spans separated by background, at least 10 units wide in the examples), and a full bottom bar (row s+4); only alignments where all three legs overlap in the same columns and match top/bottom bars trigger drawing.
 * Internal patterns vary by color and are not uniform: e.g., for color 4, the third leg row (s+3, 0-indexed within block) has isolated fills at specific offsets like columns 7,9,11; for color 8, the second leg row has a dotted pattern every other column (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9,11); for color 2, the third leg row has fills at column 9 and 11; for color 1, similar dotted or offset patterns in middle rows; these seem to resemble letterforms (e.g., 4 like 'A' with crossbar, 8 like 'B' with curves, 2 like 'Z' with diagonal).
 * Leg detection must handle "clean" separations: a leg starts with color c, followed by background gap (at least 1?), then another c, but the code's find_legs looks for c, then background(s), then c again with no non-bg in gap, and requires span >=10; however, it skips if extra c's appear immediately after, and it doesn't correctly identify multi-leg structures or varying widths.
 * The "k" value for filling central patterns depends on color but also subtly on position (l, s) or size; current get_k is ad-hoc and incorrect (e.g., for c=4, it uses c//2+1=3, but expected patterns suggest more/less fills; for c=2, it varies by s==1, but examples show consistent per-color logic).
 * Background is correctly the mode color (1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test), but output starts fully bg-filled.
 * Post-processing removes components <20 cells, which is helpful to clean noise but may remove intended small parts if patterns have thin elements; in examples, it doesn't affect mains but could if internals are sparse.
 * Grids are ~22x23, with symbols left-aligned (starting col~1), separated by bg rows; multiple symbols per grid (e.g., train1 has 4,8,2; test has 2,4,3,1).
 * Subtle: Patterns may step inward or have offsets (e.g., effective_r = l+10 assumes fixed 10-width, but legs vary); filling in mid_row (s+2) goes left every 2 steps for k times, but expected shows right-side or centered dots/bars; for some colors (3?), no internals needed, just frame.
 * Overlaps or adjacent symbols must not interfere (e.g., train3 has 2,4,1 with bg=3, no bleed).
 * Easy to miss: Legs aren't always full-height in input (input shows only legs, program adds top/bottom/internals); detection requires exact column overlap across three rows; colors are digits 1-8, bg varies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the most common color, used in all examples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This verifies full bars, essential for top/bottom checks; works but assumes exact span match.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))
    size = 1
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(This flood-fill computes connected component size and cells; very helpful for final cleanup of small noise <20 cells, as used in program; prevents false positives from tiny blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects background and initializes output as full bg.
 * It identifies leg positions in rows s+1 to s+3 via find_legs (which looks for c-bg(s)-c patterns with clean bg gap and span>=10), finds common column overlaps across three rows, and verifies top/bottom full bars— this works for positioning the outer frames (top full, bottom full, left/right sides in mid rows) in all training examples and test.
 * For train1 (bg=1, symbols at ~rows1-5 for4,7-11 for8,13-17 for2): Outer frames drawn correctly (e.g., full 4's top/bottom cols1-11, sides at col1/11 in rows2-4; similar for8 cols1-11,2 cols1-11), and small component removal doesn't erase mains.
 * For train2 (bg=8, symbols at ~rows2-6 for1? but actually1's are thin, then8-12 for6,14-18 for4): Frames correct (e.g.,6's top/bottom full cols2-12, sides col2/12;4's similar), but note train2 input likely has legs for1,6,4.
 * For train3 (bg=3, symbols at ~rows1-5 for2,7-11 for4,13-17 for1): Frames correct (e.g.,2's cols1-11, etc.).
 * Test output: Detects and frames symbols correctly for2 (rows1-5 cols1-11),4 (7-11),3 (13-17? but3 is solid? wait, legs for3?),1 (19-23 cols1-11), with bg=8 and separations.
 * What didn't work: Internal patterns completely missing or wrong in all cases—program only draws left side (col l), right side (col r in rows s+1,s+3; effective_r=l+10 in s+2), and a backward every-2-step fill in s+2 for k steps (based on flawed get_k, e.g., for c=4 k=3 so fills 3 positions left from l+10, but expected has forward/right-side isolated fills like col7,9,11 in row s+3 for4).
 * Specific differences: Train1 for4 block (rows~1-5): Generated has empty internals (only sides), expected has in row3 (s+2?): 4 at cols7,9,11; row4 (s+3): nothing extra but wait, expected row3 has 4 at1,7,9,11? (mismatch in which row); for8 block row9 (s+2 for8): generated empty, expected 8 at3,5,7,9,11 (dotted); for2 block row15 (s+2): generated empty, expected 2 at9,11. Train2 for1 block (rows~2-6): generated has sides only (but1's expected has internals in row4:1 at9? from pattern), diff: missing dots at col9,11 in row4; for6 block row10 (s+2): empty vs expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11? wait row10 expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11 (full row11? no, row10 is s+2 with dots); for4 block row16 (s+2): empty vs expected 4 at9,11. Train3 similar misses: for4 row9 empty vs expected 4 at7,9,11; for1 row15 empty vs expected 1 at7,9,11. Reasons unknown but likely wrong filling logic (backward vs forward, wrong row, wrong k/positions).
 * find_legs is partially helpful (detects spans) but broken: it requires exact c-bg-c with no extras, skips if post-gap has immediate c, assumes fixed ~10 width via effective_r=l+10 (but legs vary, e.g., train1 4's legs cols1-1? no, legs are single-col? wait, input legs are thin verticals at edges, but code treats as wide span); it misses multi-col legs or non-10 widths, leading to wrong effective_r and common sets.
 * get_k is unhelpful/broken: ad-hoc rules don't match patterns (e.g., c=1 uses l which is position, but patterns are fixed per color; c=2 depends on s==1, but train1/3 2's at different s have similar patterns; c=3=1, but train3 1's? wait 1's pattern; c=8=6 fixed, but expected dots suggest variable).
 * Overall, core detection works (positions/frames), but internals fail due to wrong pattern logic, wrong widths, and no per-color templates; small removal is fine but irrelevant here as no noise shown.
 * Program loops s in 0 to h-5, checks legs in s+1..s+3, good for multiple blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output frames the symbols correctly (e.g., full top/bottom for each block, sides at col1/11 or similar, separations with bg=8 rows), matching the structure of training examples, but lacks all internal patterns, just like the training failures—e.g., for the 2 block (rows1-5), expected likely has dots/bars in row3 or4 (similar to train1's 2 with fills at9,11); for4 (rows7-11), missing crossbar-like fills (e.g., at7,9,11); for3 (rows13-17), possibly solid or minimal but code draws frame only; for1 (rows19-23), missing dotted internals (e.g., every other from right). This does not look correct because training expects color-specific internals (dots, bars) inside the frames, not empty; the output resembles incomplete outlines, failing to "complete" the symbols as in expected trains. To handle test, need per-color pattern templates (e.g., dict of fill positions/rows) instead of generic k-fill, and better leg width detection (not fixed +10).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with background cells and incomplete "balloon" or "blob" shapes made of colored cells (non-background). The goal is to detect specific 5-row high patterns (full horizontal span at top and bottom, thin vertical connections on the sides in the three middle rows) and complete them by filling a patterned interior in the central middle row (row start+2) using a color-specific pattern, then remove any remaining small connected components (size <20) that aren't part of valid completed shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows tall: a starting row with a horizontal span of >=10 consecutive cells of the same color (non-bg), a bottom row (start+4) that is fully filled with that color across the exact same span (no gaps, sides must align), and three middle rows (start+1 to start+3) that are "thin" (only the leftmost and rightmost cells of the span are the shape's color, with all interior cells strictly background; no extra colors or protrusions inside or outside the span in those rows).
 * Filling happens only in the exact central middle row (start+2), using a stepped pattern (every 2 cells starting from a color-specific offset within the span); the pattern must not overwrite existing side cells but adds interior ones. Different colors have unique offsets and patterns (e.g., color 8: dense alternating fill starting from left; color 4: sparser fill starting ~6 cells from left, adding 3 interior cells at positions like 7,9,11 for span 1-11; color 2: even sparser, starting ~8 from left, adding 2 interior cells like 9,11; color 1 similar to 4 but sometimes skips some positions; color 6: alternating but denser than 4, starting earlier). Over-filling (e.g., adding extra cells not in expected) breaks the pattern.
 * A key condition is that fewer than 3 of the middle rows can have "interfering" elements outside the span (i.e., cells that are non-bg and not the shape's color); if >=3 middle rows have such interference (e.g., parts of other shapes), don't fill to avoid corrupting adjacent objects. Shapes must not overlap or interfere horizontally in middle rows.
 * Background is always the most common cell value across the entire grid (via flat count); assume rectangular grid, all rows same width.
 * After all fills, perform 4-way connected flood-fill (up/down/left/right, same color only) to identify components and erase any with total size <20 cells (prevents noise or incomplete partials from remaining, but completed shapes are large enough ~28+ cells even unfilled due to connections, larger after fill).
 * Subtle: Spans must be exact matches top-to-bottom (same left/right positions); multiple shapes per grid, separated by bg; detection scans from top (start_row 0 to h-5); input likely has outlines already (full top/bottom + side stubs in middles), but fill only adds interior pattern if all conditions met—missing sides in input would fail "thin" check. Easy to miss: vertical connectivity makes unfilled shapes survive size check (~28 cells via top bar + bottom bar + 6 side cells); patterns are asymmetric or offset per color, not uniform; removal happens post-all-fills on a copy to avoid interfering with detection.
 * Grids are ~23x23, but generalize; no diagonal connections; only horizontal spans trigger (no vertical or diagonal patterns).

(Helpful: Finds the first horizontal run of >=10 non-bg cells in a row, returns color + exact left/right bounds; critical for span detection, but assumes only one qualifying span per row—may miss if multiples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):

        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True

(Helpful: Verifies exact span is solidly filled with color, no bg or other intrusions; key for bottom row check.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= w:
        return False

        if row[k] != bg:
            return False

            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful: Detects interference outside span in a row (non-bg, non-shape-color cells); used to count per middle row, ensures <3 rows affected before filling.)

```
(Helpful: 4-way flood-fill to compute connected component size and cells for a starting cell/color; crucial for post-process removal of small blobs <20; returns size and set of positions for targeted erasure.)

The `fill_row` function from the attempt is partially helpful (applies stepped pattern based on color) but broken in offsets/steps for some colors (e.g., overfills for color=1, underfills/skips for color=6; returns early for unknown colors, preventing any fill).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it demonstrates partial understanding: correctly detects bg, scans for 5-row structures via span/full/thin checks, applies color-specific stepped fills in middle row, and removes small components post-fill.
 * Worked: Structure detection logic (span >=10, exact bottom full, all middle thin, interference <3 rows) is solid in concept; removal via flood-fill correctly preserves large connected shapes (e.g., unfilled balloon ~28 cells via top/bottom bars + sides survives >20 threshold); patterns match exactly for some cases (e.g., train2 color=4 adds correct 8,10,12; train1 color=8 alternating if triggered; train1 color=4 adds 7,9,11 matching expected).
 * Didn't work: Fill never triggers in any training output (generated matches input outlines exactly—no interior patterns added), likely due to implementation bug (e.g., is_thin fails silently if input middles lack sides, but generated shows sides present, suggesting input already has outlines and detection skips for unknown reason like span bounds mismatch or loop indexing error); for train1, expected adds patterns to row3 (4's: +7,9,11), row9 (8's: alternating 1,3,5,7,9,11), row16 (2's: +9,11), but generated has only sides everywhere; for train2, expected adds to row4 (1's: +10,12 but code would wrongly add 8,10,12), row10 (6's: alternating 2,6,8,10,12 but code skips entirely via else return), row16 (4's: +8,10,12 matching but not added), generated only sides; for train3, expected adds denser patterns (4's row9: +5,7,9,11 but code only +7,9,11 missing 5; 1's row15: +5,7,9,11 but code +7,9,11 missing 5; 2's no fill needed, matches generated), but generated only sides (no adds anywhere); subtle: code's offsets (e.g., +6 for 1/4, +8 for 2, 0 for 8) are close but incomplete/wrong for 1/6 (needs adjustment like +4 or different step for density); num_with_other <3 prevents false positives but may over-block if minor interference.
 * Missed: Handling all colors (e.g., no pattern for 6, partial for 1/2/4 across examples); potential bug in triggering fill (e.g., range(h-4) misses lower shapes if h small; assumes first span only, may skip if multiple); doesn't add missing sides if input lacks them (but generated suggests input has them).
 * extract_objects not present, but compute_component_size serves as essential tool for post-removal (would be useful pre-process to isolate shapes).
 * fill_row is partially helpful for patterned fill but broken/not general (hardcoded offsets fail for train3 4's/1's by missing positions like +5; skips unknown colors; step=2 too rigid—some patterns may need step=1 or variable).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it replicates the input outlines (full top/bottom spans + thin sides in all three middle rows for each of four shapes: 2's rows1-5, 4's rows7-11, 3's rows13-17, 1's rows19-23) with no interior fills added, similar to all training generated outputs; based on training expecteds, it should add color-specific patterns to the central middle row (start+2) for each shape if conditions met (e.g., for 2's row3: add ~9,11 as in train1; for 4's row9: add ~7,9,11 or denser per train3; for 3's row15: unknown pattern but likely some interior like others; for 1's row21: add ~7,9,11 or denser). No small components removed (but none qualify as shapes are connected >20 even unfilled). This suggests same trigger failure as training (no changes), making output incomplete—expected would have patterned interiors (e.g., sparse dots/clusters per color) while preserving outlines and bg=8 elsewhere; without fills, shapes remain "incomplete" per puzzle rules. Do not look correct because they ignore the core completion step, leaving all shapes as mere outlines (mismatches all training expecteds' patterned bodies); to handle test, must fix trigger (e.g., verify input has sides, adjust offsets for 3/1 if similar to 4), ensure patterns match example densities (e.g., test 3's may need custom like alternating or +4 offset).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x23 grid (or similar dimensions) where the goal is to identify specific "frame" structures (hollow 5x11 rectangles of a single color with a fully background-filled 3x9 interior) made of non-background colors, erase all other non-background elements (treating them as noise or irrelevant components), and then repopulate the middle row of each frame's interior with a specific number of 1x1 "dots" of the frame's color. The number of dots (n) is determined by counting small connected components (1-8 cells, with bonuses for 2x2 or 3x3 filled squares) of the same color elsewhere in the grid, and the dots are placed right-aligned in the interior columns (1-9 relative to frame left), preferring opposite-parity columns to the frame's right edge first, then same-parity if needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the color in the top-left cell (e.g., 1 in training 1/2, 3 in training 3, 8 in test); all processing ignores it.
 * Frames must be exactly 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, with 25-30 cells total (hollow border), and the exact 3x9 interior (rows t+1 to t+3, cols l+1 to l+9) must be entirely background—no partial fills or leaks.
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), strictly same-color; frames are identified as the large border components meeting size/bbox/internal criteria.
 * For n (dots to place): Base count is number of small components (1-8 cells) of color c outside the frame; add (size-1) extra for each fully filled square component of 2x2 (add 1) or 3x3 (add 2). This seems to represent "values" or "morse-like" encodings from small blobs elsewhere.
 * Placement: In the frame's middle interior row (t+2), place n dots of color c in columns l+1 to l+9, right-aligned (highest columns first). Prioritize columns with parity opposite to the frame's right edge column (iright % 2), taking the rightmost n such; if n exceeds available opposite-parity slots (up to 5), spill to rightmost same-parity columns. No overlaps or extensions beyond interior.
 * All other non-background cells (not in any frame) must be erased to background before placing dots; frames themselves remain intact.
 * Subtleties: Parity-based placement ensures "alternating" or "gapped" positioning to match visual patterns (e.g., avoiding adjacent dots if possible); small components might be single cells, lines, or squares, but only filled squares get bonuses—irregular shapes count as 1 regardless of size (1-8). Frames don't overlap or nest. Grid edges are all background except frames. No rotation or diagonal connections. The middle row is always row index t+2 (0-based).
 * Easy to miss: Internal check must be exactly 27 background cells (3*9); frames might have slight variations in border thickness but must fit exact bbox. Counting skips the frame itself when tallying small components for n. Placement can leave gaps if n < 9, but always right-justified with parity preference. Background fill happens after component detection but before dot placement. Test grids may have more frames (4 in test vs. 3 in trainings) and different color orders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                all_comps.append((c, component))

```
(This is helpful and correct; uses DFS stack for 4-connected same-color components, essential for extracting all objects/frames.)

        h = max_i - min_i + 1
        w = max_j - min_j + 1

            m = t + 2
            frames.append((t, l, c, m, comp))
    return frames
```
(This is mostly helpful; correctly identifies frames by size, bbox, and exact internal background count (27 cells). Minor issue: internal loop uses min_j +10, which is correct for 9 cols (1 to 9), but ensure no border bleed.)

```python
def fill_non_frame_cells(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, frame_cells: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all non-background cells not part of frames with background color."""
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    output = [row[:] for row in grid]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != bg and (i, j) not in frame_cells:
                output[i][j] = bg
    return output
```
(This is helpful and correct; clears noise while preserving frames, using a set for fast lookup—essential step before dot placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identified frames in all training examples (correct 5x11 bbox, size 25-30, full internal bg) and cleared non-frame cells to background, preserving frame borders intact.
 * Correctly grouped components by color using defaultdict(list), skipping the frame itself when counting small components for n.
 * Training example 2 passed fully, indicating the logic works for some patterns (likely where n=0 or simple right-aligned placement without spillover).
 * Failed in training 1: For color 4 frame (rows 1-5, cols 1-11), generated middle row (row 3) as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11? shifted left] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3 positions?]; for color 8 (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,8] (dense left with extras) vs expected [1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8] (alternating starting from col 1, 6 dots). Suggests n overcounted (too many dots) and/or wrong columns selected (not parity-preferred right-aligned).
 * Failed in training 3: For color 4 frame (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11—shifted] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3]; for color 1 (rows 13-17), generated row 15 as [1 at cols 7,9,11—only 3] but expected has 1 at cols 7,9,11 (wait, appears similar, but actual diff is in row 15 matching but perhaps n=3 correct while earlier frames wrong); overall, placement shifted left, ignoring parity (e.g., if iright even, prefer odd cols rightmost).
 * compute_n_for_color overcounts or miscounts small components: Counts all 1-8 cell comps as +1, and filled 2x2/3x3 as +(ww-1), but in training 1 for color 8, there might be small blobs worth n=6 (alternating), but generated placed 8+ incorrectly; unknown if bonuses applied wrong (e.g., treating lines as squares).
 * get_placement_columns has parity logic but buggy: For iright even (e.g., l+10 even if l even), opp_par=odd, takes rightmost n odds (e.g., 9,7,5,...), but in generated, it places in even cols or leftward, suggesting wrong sorting or spillover (poss_opp[-n:] takes last n, which are rightmost if list is left-to-right).
 * program main flow is solid (bg -> comps -> frames -> group by color -> clear noise -> place dots per frame), but dot placement fails due to n miscalculation and column selection errors.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, but compute_n_for_color and get_placement_columns need fixes (e.g., verify filled square detection: check if hh==ww and pp==hh*ww and 2<=ww<=3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 4 frames (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23), clears all noise (e.g., no stray cells outside frames), and preserves borders, with background 8 everywhere else. However, interior fillings are wrong or incomplete: For color 2 (n likely 0, no small 2-blobs elsewhere), middle row 3 is all bg—correct (empty). For color 4 (row 9), generated [4,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,4] (dense with left bias, 6+ dots?) vs likely expected alternating right-aligned (e.g., 4 at cols 1,3,5,7,9 or rightmost 5 if n=5, but pattern looks like overcounted n=6 without parity, placing adjacently). For color 3 (row 15), [3 at col 9 only? sparse] suggests undercounted n=1, but if small 3-blobs exist (e.g., single or 2x2), expected might need 2-3 rightmost opposite-parity. For color 1 (row 21), [1 at cols 9,11? but extended] looks like n=2 but wrong columns (should be rightmost, e.g., 8+1=9 if odd preferred). Overall, placements are not right-aligned with parity (e.g., favors left/even cols), leading to non-alternating patterns; does not match visual consistency of trainings (e.g., expected would have gapped, right-heavy dots). Missing: Proper spillover handling if n>5, and exact n from small comps (test has potential 2x2/3x3 bonuses unseen).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detecting and reconstructing specific 5-row-high "ladder" or "table-like" structures in a grid, where each structure consists of colored bars and legs on a uniform background (8), and the output is a cleaned or redrawn version of the input grid with only valid structures rendered while ignoring or blanking invalid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must span exactly 11 columns (full top and bottom bars), with thin legs only at the exact left and right ends in the three middle rows (no extra colors in between, which must be background).
 * Background is determined from the top-left cell; all non-structure areas in output are filled with background.
 * Middle row (row s+2) includes a crossbar connecting the legs, with length varying by color c: for c=1, it's position-dependent (4 - l); for c=2, it's 1 or 2 segments based on a side parameter s (possibly start position); for c>=3, it's roughly c//2 + 1 segments, placed from the right end and stepping left by 2 columns each time.
 * Structures cannot overlap or extend beyond grid height (must fit within h-4 rows from start s); once detected and drawn, mark the 5 rows as visited to skip reprocessing.
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from top, finds candidate top bars of exactly length 11 in input row s, validates middle rows for thinness (only ends colored with c, rest background), and bottom row for full span of c.
 * Subtlety: Crossbar drawing starts from right end (r) and extends left in even steps (pos -= 2), which can create asymmetric or partial connections (e.g., for higher c, more rungs; for c=1/2, shorter or conditional).
 * Only process non-visited rows; break after drawing one structure per starting row block to avoid multiples.
 * Easy to miss: Bars must be exactly contiguous length 11 (no longer/shorter); thin check is strict (any non-bg in middle leg rows invalidates); crossbar count k can be miscalculated for edge cases like l/r positions or low c values.
 * Input may have noisy or incomplete structures, so output reinitializes to bg and redraws only validated ones.
 * Grid width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(Scans for exact 11-cell contiguous non-bg runs; essential for candidate detection.)

    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Validates middle rows have only endpoint colors, rest bg; strict and key for leg thinness.)

        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks bottom bar is fully colored with c; simple but critical.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l  # Position-dependent for c=1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Conditional on s (start row?) for c=2
    return c // 2 + 1  # General formula for higher c
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; handles special cases for low c, but s param usage unclear and potentially buggy.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h:

        while count < k and pos >= l:
            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Core drawing logic; builds full structure including variable crossbar. Note: crossbar always includes endpoints, then adds k-? internals stepping left from r.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Prevents reprocessing drawn blocks; essential for non-overlapping detection.)

The main program orchestrates: init output to bg, scan rows, find/validate/draw/mark.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken, but get_k may be flawed for c=2 (s param is start row index, but logic "1 if s==1 else 2" seems arbitrary/unrelated to puzzle—possibly incorrect for test cases where s varies; could lead to inconsistent crossbars). find_bars skips bg correctly but assumes bars start after bg runs; might miss if bar touches edge (but i starts at 0, so okay).

 * This is the only provided attempt; it successfully detected and redrew structures for all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection (11-bar top/bottom, thin legs) works for simple cases.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety in crossbar for c=2/1 not tested in training—could be why test needs review.
 * Visited marking and single-break per block prevented over-drawing in training.
 * No omissions or mismatches in training (all passed), but unknown if training had variable crossbars.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows four vertically stacked, non-overlapping 5-row structures (for c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), each with full top/bottom 11-cell bars starting at col=1, thin legs at col=1 and col=11 for the three middle rows, and background elsewhere; separated by all-bg rows (0,6,12,18,24-26).
 * For c=2 and c=3: Middle row (row 3 for first, 9 for second? Wait, for c=2: row 3 has only col1=2 and col11=2 (thin, no crossbar fill); same for c=3 at row 15 (only ends).
 * For c=4: Middle row 9 has col1=4, col7=4, col9=4, col11=4 (three internal fills, stepping left from 11: pos=11,9,7 >=1).
 * For c=1: Middle row 21 has col1=1, col7=1, col9=1, col11=1 (same pattern as c=4).
 * This looks mostly correct assuming input had these structures (program redrew cleanly on bg); crossbars match get_k logic (for c=4: 4//2+1=3 segments; for c=1: if l=1, 4-1=3 segments; for c=3: 3//2+1=2, but output shows only ends—wait, discrepancy: for c=3 middle row 15: only col1=3, col11=3, no internals like col9 or col7, so crossbar not filled beyond legs, suggesting get_k(3,l=1,s=13)=2 but drawing only added 0 internals? Wait, drawing always sets l and r, then adds k more stepping left, but if k=2, it should set pos=11 (already r), pos=9; but output lacks col9=3, so either input didn't validate or get_k miscomputed (s=13 !=1, but for c=3 uses general formula). For c=2 at s=1: get_k=1 if s==1, so adds 1 more (pos=11 already, then pos=9=2), but output row3 has no col9=2—only ends, so crossbar addition failed or k=0 effectively. Thus, test output does NOT fully match expected clean redraw: missing internal crossbar fills for c=2/3 (only legs drawn, no rungs), while c=1/4 have them; this differs from expected (should have partial rungs per color formula), likely due to get_k bug for c=2 (conditional on s==1 but doesn't add enough) or drawing loop (count starts after endpoints? No, loop sets pos=r which is already set). For c=3, k=2 should add one internal (pos=9), but absent—unknown why (perhaps validation failed in input, but output shows structure drawn, so partial). Overall, structures detected correctly, but crossbars incomplete for lower c, making output incorrect for full reconstruction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the program must detect incomplete 5-row-high table-like structures (with a full top bar, thin vertical legs in the middle three rows, and a full bottom bar) in an input grid and complete them in the output grid by filling in a specific crossbar pattern in the central middle row (row s+2). The structures are 11 units wide, use a consistent non-background color c for each, and the crossbar consists of c-colored pixels placed every other column starting from the right leg and extending leftward, with the number of crossbar positions determined by rules based on c (to form digit-like or symbolic patterns).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must be exactly 5 rows high (s to s+4), with top (s) and bottom (s+4) rows having exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (non-background), detected via run-length of length 11.
 * Middle three rows (s+1 to s+3) must be "thin" legs: only the left (l) and right (r = l+10) positions are c, with all positions between l+1 and r-1 being background (bg); any non-bg in between invalidates the structure.
 * Background bg is assumed to be the top-left cell value (g[0][0]); output grid starts as all bg and only modified where structures are drawn.
 * Crossbar is only in the exact central middle row (s+2), starting at pos = r and stepping left by 2 (pos -= 2) for k steps, where k depends on c: examples show k=1 for c=1 and c=2 (no visible extra beyond legs), k=2 for c=3 (adds one extra at r-2), k=3 for c=4 (adds two extras at r-2 and r-4), k=4 for c=6 (adds three extras at r-2, r-4, r-6); legs at l and r are always drawn in all middle rows, but crossbar may overlap r.
 * Structures do not overlap; use visited tracking to skip rows already covered (mark s to min(s+4, h) as visited after drawing).
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from 0 to h-5, finds candidate bars only in top row s, validates bottom and middles, then draws if valid; only one structure per starting s (breaks after first valid).
 * Subtlety: Crossbar rule is c-dependent and not simply c//2 +1 (works for c=3,4,6 but overdraws for c=1 with k=3 instead of k=1); special case for c=2 depending on s (k=1 if s==1 else 2) is inconsistent and likely incorrect, as it ties to row position rather than fixed per-c rule.
 * Width w assumed constant across rows; ignore bars shorter/longer than 11 or with length !=11.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar does not fill continuously but skips every other column (step -2 from r); for small k (e.g., 1), it only reinforces the right leg (no new pixels); structures may appear in any order/position but are processed top-to-bottom without reordering.
 * Output must exactly match input's detected parts but complete the crossbars; no drawing if validation fails (e.g., bottom not full, middle not thin).
 * Considerations across attempts: Scanning only unvisited rows prevents overlap; early break after drawing one per s avoids multiples; but get_k overestimates k for low c like 1, leading to extra pixels.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Helpful: Correctly identifies bg from top-left.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:

        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))
        i = j
    return res
```
(Helpful: Accurately finds exactly 11-long runs of non-bg in a row, returning (left, right, color); ignores bg and shorter/longer runs; essential for candidate detection in top row.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Validates "thin legs" by checking only ends are c and interior is all bg; core to middle row validation.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Checks if a row segment from l to r is entirely c; used for top/bottom validation.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h:

        while count < k and pos >= l:
            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Helpful: Draws the full structure if valid; fills top/bottom fully, legs at ends in middles, and crossbar every other from right; bounds-checked for h; but relies on broken get_k.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Helpful: Marks 5 rows as visited to skip overlaps; essential for non-overlapping processing.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, s: int) -> int:  # Current version broken
    if c == 1:
        return 3  # Wrong: should be 1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Inconsistent: should be fixed per c, e.g., 1
    return c // 2 + 1  # Works for c=3,4,6 but not low c
```
(Unhelpful/broken: Overdraws for c=1 (k=3 adds extras at r-2,r-4); special s-dependency for c=2 is arbitrary and likely wrong; needs rewrite to fixed per-c mapping, e.g., k = max(1, c // 2) or empirical: 1->1,2->1,3->2,4->3,6->4.)

The main program function orchestrates: init output/visited, scan s, find bars in g[s], validate full bottom and thin middles, draw if valid, mark visited. (Helpful overall structure, but fails due to get_k.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects structures via 11-long top bars, validates thin legs and full bottom, and draws tops/bottoms/legs accurately, as shown by training examples 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * What worked: For c=4 (k=3), crossbar correctly at r, r-2, r-4 (e.g., columns 12,10,8 plus leg at 2), matching expected; for c=6 (k=4), crossbar at r to r-6 step -2 (12,10,8,6 plus leg 2), matching expected; visited marking prevents overlaps, and thin/full checks are precise.
 * What didn't work: For c=1, get_k returns 3, drawing extra crossbar pixels at r-2=10 and r-4=8 (generated row 4: 1's at columns 2,8,10,12), but expected has only legs at 2 and 12 (no extras); this causes training example 2 to fail entirely due to mismatched middle row.
 * No other attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core detection/drawing logic; issue isolated to get_k for low c (1 and possibly 2).
 * find_bars, is_thin, is_full are essential and correct; draw_structure is mostly helpful but broken via get_k; mark_visited prevents errors in multi-structure grids.
 * get_k is broken/unhelpful in current form (overdraws extras for c=1, arbitrary s-dependency for c=2); don't use without fixing to per-c values (e.g., empirical mapping from examples).
 * Training 2 mismatches only in c=1 crossbar (extras at 8 and 10 unknown why expected omits, but clearly different: generated has four 1's, expected two); for c=4 and c=6, generated matches expected exactly (no differences noted).
 * No omissions or shape mismatches beyond crossbar; blob shapes match where k is correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it applies the same flawed logic: for c=1 (bottom structure, s=19?), k=3 draws extras at columns 7,9,11 (plus leg at 1: 1's at 1,7,9,11 in row 21), but based on training 2, this likely should be only legs at 1 and 11 (no extras, similar error as c=1 in training 2).
 * For c=2 (top structure, s=1), k=1 (due to s==1 special case) draws only at r=11 (already leg), resulting in only legs at 1 and 11 in row 3, which looks correct for a minimal crossbar (matches "1"-like thinness, no extras).
 * For c=4 (second structure, s=7?), k=3 draws at 11,9,7 (plus leg 1: 1,7,9,11 in row 9), which matches the pattern that worked in training 2, so likely correct.
 * For c=3 (third structure, s=13?), k=2 (3//2+1) draws at 11,9 (plus leg 1: 1,9,11 in row 15), which fits the incremental pattern (one extra vs. c=1/2), and looks sensible (no overdraw), likely correct.
 * Overall, test output is consistent with program logic but inherits the c=1 error (extra pixels in bottom structure's middle row); tops/bottoms/legs are correct everywhere; if c=1 should have no extras (as in training 2 expected), then test fails similarly—account for fixed k per c (e.g., 1 for c=1/2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4, 4 for 6) to handle low-c cases without s-dependency.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color B and multiple rectangular frames (borders) of various colors C, each with empty interiors filled with B. The goal is to remove all small connected components (blobs) of non-background colors scattered in the background areas by setting them to B, count the number N of such small blobs per color C (each component counts as 1 regardless of size), and then restore N pixels of color C inside each corresponding frame's interior on the middle row, placed in the rightmost min(N, 4) of 4 possible every-other-column positions (typically odd-offset columns like 3,5,7,9 relative to the frame start).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are fixed-width (11 columns) rectangles of height 4 or 5, with full top/bottom rows of C, side columns of C on inner rows, and interiors entirely B (if not all B, the frame isn't detected).
 * Small components are 4-directionally connected groups of the same non-B color with size 1-8; components larger than 8 are not removed or counted (likely part of frames or ignored).
 * Counting: Each small component of color C contributes exactly 1 to N for that C, regardless of size or shape—no special doubling for 2x2 squares of size 4 (this overcounts and is a key error in the attempt).
 * Placement inside frame: Only on the middle inner row (for height 5: second inner row; for height 4: first inner row). Use 4 possible slots in the 9-column interior, at relative offsets [1,3,5,7] from the left inner edge (fc+1), resulting in global columns fc+2, fc+4, fc+6, fc+8 (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9 if fc=1). Place C in the rightmost min(N,4) of these slots; leave others as B. Limit to 4 max, even if N>4.
 * Subtlety: All examples show frames starting at column 1 (fc=1), but the code searches for them. Background B is g[0][0], assumed consistent.
 * Subtlety: Removals happen across the entire grid (including any erroneous smalls inside frames, but frames are detected only if inner is all B, so inputs likely have empty inners). No smalls of frame color C are inside frames initially.
 * Easy to miss: Connected components use 4 directions (up, down, left, right); diagonals don't count. Visited array prevents recounting. No removal if size >8 or 0.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs preserve the original frames and background; only smalls are erased, and placements are added only inside detected frames.
 * Potential edge: If no smalls for a C (N=0), inner remains all B. If multiple frames of same C, each gets placements based on total N (code accumulates total small_count[C]).
 * Potential edge: Grid sizes vary slightly (e.g., 23x23 vs. 20x23), but frames are consistent. No frames overlapping or adjacent in examples.
 * The test input has frames for colors 1(odd),2(even),3(odd),4(even) with B=8; placements follow the same odd-column pattern as other examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies B from top-left; simple and reliable.)

```python
def find_frames(g: List[List[int]], B: int) -> List[tuple]:
    # Searches for 11-wide frames of height 4 or 5 with border C and inner all B.
    # Returns list of (C, start_row, start_col, height) for detected frames.
    # Helpful for isolating frames; works well in all examples (detects correctly, as placements happen in right locations).
    # Subtlety: Skips if top-left of potential frame is B; assumes no partial frames.
```
(This function is solid and detects frames accurately based on the rigid structure; key to the puzzle.)

```python
def process_smalls(g: List[List[int]], B: int, out: List[List[int]], frames: List[tuple]) -> dict:
    # Finds and removes (sets to B) all small (<=8 size) connected components of non-B colors using DFS/stack and visited grid.
    # Counts components per color in small_count dict (but current special case for size==4 2x2 adding +2 instead of +1 is broken and causes overcounting).
    # is_special logic for 2x2 squares is unhelpful/broken—not needed; treat all small components as +1.
    # Frames param is unused in function but passed; removal happens globally.
    # Helpful overall for removal and counting, but fix the counting to always +1 per component.
```
(This is mostly helpful for component extraction and removal, but the special case makes it incorrect for counting; remove the is_special and always +1 if not special.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: copies grid to out, gets B, finds frames, processes smalls (removes and counts), then places C pixels in frames based on N. Placement logic (rightmost slots via selected_rel = possible_rel[num_pos - to_fill:]) works well; fixed possible_rel=[1,3,5,7] matches most examples.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection via find_frames worked correctly in all cases (placements occur in expected frame locations and heights).
 * Small component removal worked (outers are cleared to B in outputs).
 * Placement positions worked for training 2 (correct overall) and partially for 1/3 (right number of slots from right, e.g., N=1 at col9, N=4 at 3/5/7/9, N=2 expected at 7/9 but code overplaced due to N error).
 * Counting in process_smalls failed for training 1 and 3: overcounted N for color 4 (placed 4 instead of expected 2 in train1; placed 3 instead of 2 in train3), likely due to broken special case for 2x2 size=4 components adding +2 each instead of +1 (e.g., two 2x2 would give N=4 wrong, should be 2).
 * For training 1: Generated extra inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3 positions) but expected only col7/9 (2); all other frames (2 and 8) matched expected positions and counts.
 * For training 3: Generated inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3) but expected col7/9 (2); color 2 had N=0 correctly (no inner); color 1 had inner 1's at col8/10 (possibly a transcription issue or code bug for odd C, but expected matches printed so may be correct, with mismatch elsewhere minor).
 * Training 2 passed fully, indicating core structure (detection, removal, placement from right) works when counts are accurate.
 * The is_special 2x2 logic is broken/unhelpful (leads to overcount; remove it to fix N).
 * No issues with background detection or grid copying.
 * Potential transcription error in training 3 color1 positions (col8/10 even cols vs. code's odd cols 7/9), but since expected matches printed generated, it may indicate need for parity-based rel (odd C use [2,4,6,8] for even cols 4/6/8/10, rightmost N); however, test uses odd cols for odd C=1/3, so likely always [1,3,5,7] and ex3 print is erroneous.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and consistent with the pattern: removes smalls (assumed), places rightmost N slots in odd inner columns (3,5,7,9) for all frames—e.g., for color 2 (even): 3 placements at col5/7/9 (rightmost 3); color 4 (even): 4 at 3/5/7/9; color 3 (odd): 1 at col9; color 1 (odd): 1 at col9. All in middle rows, frames intact, background 8 preserved.
 * It makes sense as an application of the rules (N=3 for 2, N=4 for 4, N=1 for 3 and 1), but without expected, can't confirm exact counts; positions match the core principle (rightmost every-other from left inner, odd cols). If ex3's even-col placement for odd C=1 is real, test's odd-col for odd C=1/3 doesn't match and would be incorrect—but likely ex3 print error, and test is correct.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (8) and incomplete table-like structures in different colors (1, 2, 3, 4), where each structure consists of a top horizontal bar of 11 consecutive cells, at least 3 vertical legs (pairs of colored cells at the ends with background in between), an optional bottom bar, and a crossbar that needs to be completed in the middle leg row. The program's task is to detect these structures in the input grid and output a new grid with the structures fully drawn, including adding the color-specific crossbar segments on the right side of the middle leg, while filling the rest with background and avoiding overlaps via a visited mechanism.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must start with exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c != background in a row, checked via is_full; shorter or longer bars are ignored.
 * Legs are detected downward from the top bar, requiring exactly two c cells at positions l and l+10 with all background (bg) strictly between (l+1 to l+9); if any non-bg appears between, it's not a valid leg (this ensures input legs are "clean" without premature crossbars).
 * At least 3 consecutive valid legs are required to process a structure; fewer are skipped.
 * Bottom bar is preferably detected as a full 11-cell bar exactly one row below the last leg (s + num_leg + 1); if not present or out of bounds, default to s + 4 (though not used in this test).
 * Crossbar is always drawn in the middle leg row (s + 1 + (num_leg // 2)), starting with the leg endpoints (l and l+10), then adding k-1 additional cells inward from the right endpoint at even steps (l+10 - 2*p for p=0 to k-1), creating a right-aligned "cross" pattern (e.g., for k=3: cells at l+10, l+8, l+6; left leg at l remains isolated).
 * Crossbar width k is color- and position-dependent via get_k: c=1 uses 4 - l (e.g., 3 for l=1, adding cells at positions 11,9,7 relative to l=1); c=2 uses 1 if starting row s==1 (minimal, no extras) else 2; c>=3 uses c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3 adding at 11,9; 3 for c=4 adding at 11,9,7).
 * All drawing overwrites to c only for top/bottom (full 11 cells), legs (just endpoints), and crossbar (endpoints + extras); the output grid starts as all bg, so it reconstructs structures without copying extraneous input cells.
 * Process rows from top to bottom (s loop), skipping visited rows to prevent reprocessing overlaps; marks all rows from top to bottom (inclusive) as visited after drawing.
 * Subtlety: get_k's special case for c=2 depending on s==1 assumes position-specific rules (e.g., topmost structure gets minimal cross); this works for training but may fail if 2 appears elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: Structures are exactly 11 cells wide (l to l+10), starting at various l but fixed width; no rotation, vertical, or irregular shapes.
 * Subtlety: Input may have "clean" legs (bg between) but the program adds the crossbar, implying the puzzle is to complete/infer the cross; if input already has cross-like non-bg between legs, detection fails (is_leg returns False), skipping the structure.
 * All structures in test start at l=1, but code handles general l; background uniform from g[0][0].
 * No handling for isolated bars, fewer than 3 legs, or non-horizontal elements; assumes no overlapping structures (visited prevents but may miss interleaved ones).
 * Grid size: n rows, m=23 columns in test; l < m-10 to fit 11 cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color, essential for distinguishing structures and checking legs.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    return all(row[k] == c for k in range(l, l + 10))  # Note: range(l, l+11) would be correct for 11 cells; current is l to l+9 (10 cells)—potential off-by-one bug, but works if input matches.
```
(Checks for full horizontal bar of exactly 11 cells; critical for tops/bottoms; subtle off-by-one in range may cause issues for edge cases.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, bg: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[l + 10] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, l + 10):  # Checks l+1 to l+9 (9 cells); assumes input has bg here for valid leg.
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Key for detecting clean legs; strict bg requirement between endpoints ensures no premature crossbars in input.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar width; essential for color-specific completion; s-dependency for c=2 is position-aware but brittle if 2 moves.)

The main program function integrates these to detect, count legs, draw components, and mark visited rows; no types like classes needed, but could add a Structure dataclass for top/l/legs/bottom/k if refactoring.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it successfully passed all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection of full bars, legs, and crossbar drawing works for those cases.
 * Likely handled training structures with clean legs and position-specific k values (e.g., c=2 at s=1 getting k=1).
 * Potential missed subtlety: range in is_full is to l+10 (10 cells), but 11 needed (should be l+11); may coincidentally work if inputs align but risks missing 1-cell shorts.
 * get_k's s==1 for c=2 assumes fixed positioning; if training had 2 only at top, it passed, but generalizes poorly.
 * Visited marking from s to bottom inclusive prevents overlaps effectively in vertical stacking (as in test).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_full, is_leg, get_k) are relevant and core to detection/drawing—no broken ones noted, though is_full range is subtly imprecise.
 * No extraction of full objects attempted; code processes inline without storing structures, which works but could miss if needing to validate post-draw.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct based on puzzle rules: it reconstructs 4 stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23) with tops/bottoms as full 11-cell bars (cols 1-11), legs as endpoints only (cols 1 and 11), and crossbars added only in middle leg rows with color-specific widths—no extras for c=2 (k=1, row 3: just cols 1/11), one extra for c=3 (k=2, row 15: cols 1/9/11), two extras for c=4 and c=1 (k=3, rows 9/21: cols 1/7/9/11), all on bg elsewhere with no overlaps.
 * Expected: Input likely had clean outlines (full tops/bottoms, legs with bg between, no crossbars), and program completed crosses correctly without copying input extras; output isolates right-aligned cross patterns (e.g., no full horizontal cross, just stepped right-side fills + left leg).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Crossbars are not symmetric/full (e.g., gap between left leg at col 1 and right cross starting at col 7/9/11); this matches code but may be a subtlety— if puzzle expects connected/full bars, it's incorrect (unknown without true output, but consistent with training success).
 * For c=2, no change beyond legs (correct per k=1 and s=1); for others, added cells (e.g., row 9 cols 7/9 filled from bg to 4) complete the pattern without over-drawing.
 * All rows between structures (e.g., 0/6/12/18/24-26) are pure bg (8), and post-23 rows untouched; no artifacts or skips.
 * Overall, output demonstrates understanding: detects all 4 structures (num_leg=3 each), draws precisely, handles varying k; looks correct assuming puzzle goal is right-aligned cross completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties Across All Train Examples

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** example. These are limited to properties and components that reliably interact or affect each other (e.g., via color matching, position adjacency implied by bbox overlap or proximity, count-based transformations, pixel/hole changes). Only elements with direct, consistent effects are included—no high-level puzzle solving, no irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., non-interacting shapes without frame matches), no forced connections (e.g., no semantic meaning assumed for shapes like plus signs or L-shapes, as they are not present in the data). Unknowns (e.g., exact spacing logic for tiny positions beyond "centered") are noted as such.

#### 1. **Color-Matched Small Filled Shapes → Rectangular Frames → Inner Filled Shapes**
   - **Components Involved**: Small filled shapes (holes=0, small bbox like [15,1,16,2], pixels ≥2, various colors), rectangular outline frames (holes=1, large bbox like [1,1,11,5], pixels=28, colors: yellow, maroon, red, blue, pink, green), inner filled shapes (holes=0 initially, bbox nested inside frame like [2,2,10,4], pixels=27, color matching background).
   - **Connection/Interaction**:
     - Small shapes of color C only interact if a frame of exact same color C exists (consistent: non-matching smalls like green in train 1/2 have no effect on any frame/inner).
     - Position effect: Small shapes with bbox adjacent or near (e.g., x=14-21, y overlapping frame's y-range) to a color-C frame enable interaction; no interaction if no such frame (e.g., maroon small in train 3 ignored).
     - Transformation: Each small shape of color C transforms into exactly 1 tiny single-pixel dot (holes=0, bbox single point like [7,3,7,3], pixels=1, color C) inside the inner shape of the matching color-C frame.
       - Count consistency: Number of tiny dots of color C = exact number of small shapes of color C (e.g., 4 small maroons → 4 tiny maroons in train 1; 3 small pinks → 3 tiny pinks in train 2; 2 small yellows → 2 tiny yellows in train 3).
     - Effect on inner shape (consistent across all): Inner of matching frame gains +1 hole and -1 pixel per tiny dot (color of inner unchanged; e.g., 0→4 holes and 27→23 pixels for 4 tinies in train 1 middle inner; no change if no matching smalls, e.g., top inner in train 3).
     - Position effect on tinies: Tiny dots placed inside inner's bbox, horizontally centered (x around inner's x-center like 6-7), at vertical center (y = inner's y-center); spaced evenly horizontally (e.g., every 2 units for N>1). Exact spacing offset unknown (consistent pattern but not fully explainable from data).
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Interacting**: Small shapes without color match to any frame are removed without creating tinies or affecting inners (e.g., all greens/reds in train 2; maroon in train 3).

#### 2. **All Small Filled Shapes → Background**
   - **Components Involved**: All small filled shapes (as above, regardless of color match), background (holes= many like 8-14, large bbox like [0,0,22,22], pixels < max possible, color matching inners: blue in train 1, maroon in train 2, green in train 3).
   - **Connection/Interaction**:
     - All small shapes (matching or non-matching) are fully removed (disappear from output; consistent: no smalls remain outside in any output).
     - Pixel transfer: Total pixels from all removed smalls contribute to background (+ total small pixels across all examples: +28 in train 1, +27 in train 2, +30 in train 3).
     - Adjustment for interacting smalls: For each interacting small (color-matched, creating a tiny), subtract 1 pixel (the tiny's pixel) from the transfer; remainder goes to background (consistent: e.g., 7 interacting smalls in train 1 → -7 from smalls' total for tinies, but full small pixels still net + to bg after other effects).
     - Color consistency: Background color unchanged and always matches inner shapes' color (no transformation effect).
   - **No Connection**: Background color does not affect smalls or frames; isolated smalls without frames still transfer pixels fully (no tiny created).

#### 3. **Inner Filled Shapes → Background (via Hole/Pixel Loss)**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner filled shapes (as above), background (as above).
   - **Connection/Interaction**:
     - Pixel loss from inners (only from +holes/-pixels due to tinies) transfers directly to background (+1 pixel to bg per 1 pixel lost from any inner; consistent: total inner losses = total new holes across all inners, e.g., +7 to bg from inners in train 1 matching smalls' tiny count).
     - Hole effect on background: Background holes decrease by amount related to total transfers (e.g., 12→3 in train 1, decrease=9; 11→3 in train 2, decrease=8; 8→3 in train 3, decrease=5), but exact formula unknown (consistent decrease but not fully explainable; always ends at holes=3 in these examples? Uncertain beyond trend).
     - Position: No direct position interaction; effect is global pixel/hole count change.
   - **No Effect if No Loss**: Unchanged inners (no matching smalls) cause 0 transfer (e.g., top inner in train 3).

#### 4. **General Consistent Properties (No Isolated Elements)**
   - **Frames Overall**: All frames (outlines) remain completely unchanged (holes=1, pixels=28, bbox, color fixed; no interaction with non-matching elements; e.g., yellow frame in train 1 unaffected by maroon smalls).
   - **Pixel Conservation**: Total pixels across all components conserved (input sum = output sum: 529 in trains 1/2, 460 in train 3); enforced by transfers above (smalls + inner losses → bg; tinies offset inner losses).
   - **Hole Count Consistency**: Only inners and background have hole changes; frames fixed at holes=1; smalls/tinies always holes=0.
   - **Structural Stack**: Three frames consistently stacked vertically (y-ranges [1-5], [7-11], [13-17]), each with nested inner; background encloses all (bbox [0,0,22,*]); smalls positioned outside/adjacent (x=14-21).
   - **Unknowns/Non-Forced**:
     - Exact tiny x-spacing logic (e.g., why [7,3] and [9,3] vs. [8,16] and [10,16]): Consistent centering but offset varies slightly; not explainable without more data.
     - Background final holes (often 3, but why?): Decreases consistently with transfers, but precise calc unknown.
     - No connections for: Pixels >1 in smalls (not preserved beyond count); specific small bbox sizes (only count matters); any semantic shape meaning (e.g., no plus/L/bar in data); inconsistent elements (none found).

These are the only obvious, consistent interactions; no other components (e.g., no plus signs or bars in data) show effects across all examples. Non-interacting elements (e.g., unmatched smalls) only connect via pixel transfer to background.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 05:40:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the goal is to detect and render specific "structure" patterns (resembling tables or frames with top/bottom bars and side legs) made of consecutive colored cells against a background, then output a cleaned or completed version of the grid by drawing these structures explicitly, including color-specific crossbars in the middle of the leg sections. The structures must have exactly 11 consecutive cells for top/bottom bars, at least 2 "thin" leg rows (only endpoints colored, middle background), and the program processes from top to bottom, marking visited rows to avoid overlap.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures are defined by a top full bar of exactly length 11 (no longer/shorter runs detected, as find_bars skips to look for exactly 11), followed by consecutive thin rows (is_thin checks only endpoints are color c, all between are background), followed immediately by a bottom full bar of 11; if fewer than 2 thin rows or no bottom bar, no structure is drawn.
 * Background is always the top-left cell value (get_background), assumed uniform; output initializes to all background.
 * Processing is top-down (s increments, skipping visited), and only the first valid bar per starting row is drawn (drew=True breaks after one), potentially missing multiple structures per row if they exist.
 * Crossbar is added only in the computed mid_row of thin_rows (s + 1 + num_thin//2, which may not be perfectly centered for even num_thin), placed every other column starting from the right edge (r), for exactly k positions where k depends on color c via get_k: special cases for c=1 (4 - l, l=left index, assumes l=1 for k=3) and c=2 (1 if starting row s==1 else 2, oddly dependent on absolute row position); for c>=3, k = c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3, 3 for c=4).
 * Legs are only drawn at the exact input thin_rows positions (not filled vertically between top/bottom), preserving input sparsity; crossbar may overwrite leg pixels (e.g., rightmost always hits r) or add new colored cells in what was background in thin rows.
 * Visited marks all rows from s to bottom_rr inclusive, preventing re-detection of overlapping or adjacent structures.
 * Subtle: find_bars ignores runs shorter/longer than 11 and skips background; i < w-10 ensures room for 11-cell run; no handling for non-consecutive thin rows (must be immediate sequence) or structures not starting with full bar in non-visited row.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar placement is right-aligned and spaced by 2 (pos -=2), creating dotted effect (e.g., columns 11,9,7 for k=3, r=11); for c=2 in first structure (s==1), minimal k=1 limits to right edge only; no vertical filling of legs, so output legs match input positions exactly; multiple structures are stacked vertically with background separators, but bottom rows remain all-background.
 * Considerations across attempts: Detection works for isolated vertical stacks but may fail if structures overlap horizontally/vertically or have varying leg counts; crossbar logic seems ad-hoc and position-dependent, potentially wrong for non-standard l or s; no error handling for empty/malformed grids; assumes all bars start at same column (e.g., col 1-11), as seen in test.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; essential for distinguishing structures.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        c = row[i]
        j = i
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans row for exactly 11-consecutive non-bg runs, returning start, end (0-indexed), color; core for detecting top bars, ignores shorter/longer.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[j] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks if exact range l to r is entirely color c; used for top/bottom bars.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for j in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[j] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Verifies thin leg row: endpoints c, all interior bg; key for identifying leg sections without middle fills.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, thin_rows: List[int], bottom_rr: int) -> None:
    # Draw top
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s][j] = c
    # Draw bottom
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        output[bottom_rr][j] = c
    # Draw legs
    for tr in thin_rows:
        output[tr][l] = c
        output[tr][r] = c
    # Draw crossbar
    num_thin = len(thin_rows)
    mid_row = s + 1 + (num_thin // 2)
    k = get_k(c, l, s)
    pos = r
    count = 0
    while count < k and pos >= l:
        output[mid_row][pos] = c
        pos -= 2
        count += 1
```
(Renders the detected structure: top/bottom full, legs at input thin positions, crossbar in computed middle row with k right-aligned every-2-columns segments; central to output generation.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; helpful but likely flawed—special cases for low c, position-dependent for c=2; may need generalization for varying l/s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only submission shown; detection of structures (top bar, consecutive thin legs >=2, bottom bar) worked perfectly for all 3 training examples, producing correct outputs.
 * Drawing top/bottom full and legs at exact thin positions worked in training, but crossbar addition (via get_k and right-aligned placement) may be over-specific or incorrect, as it depends on absolute s (row index) for c=2 and assumes fixed l=1.
 * Visited marking prevented overlaps successfully in training, but could miss horizontal multiples (only draws first bar per starting row).
 * find_bars, is_full, is_thin are essential and correct for extraction; draw_structure is core but crossbar logic (every-2 spacing from right) might be unnecessary or wrong if expected is full crossbar or no crossbar.
 * get_k is helpful for color-specific patterns but broken/not general (e.g., c=2 ties to s==1, which works for training's first structure but fails if c=2 appears later; untested for c>4 or l!=1).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the while loop in main only increments s by 1 even after drawing (though skips visited), which is inefficient but worked; no extraction of full objects beyond bars—could add a function to bundle entire structure data (e.g., height, leg count) for better validation.
 * Training 1-3 all correct, implying core detection/rendering matches expected for simple cases (likely single structures with 3 thin rows, standard colors 1-3, l=1).
 * No known mismatches in training, but subtle: if training had no crossbars needed or minimal k, it passed; potential issue if training avoided c=4 or varying s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output rendered four stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23, 0-indexed) separated by all-background rows, with remaining bottom rows all-background (27 rows total); each has full top/bottom bars cols 1-11, legs at cols 1/11 in 3 thin rows each, and color-specific crossbars in middle thin row (row 3 for 2: col 11 only; row 9 for 4: cols 7,9,11; row 15 for 3: cols 9,11; row 21 for 1: cols 7,9,11).
 * Observed effects: Crossbars add extra c cells in middle thin row (e.g., for 4, row 9 has c at 1(leg),7,9,11(leg+overlap), turning a thin row into partial fill; similar dotted right-aligned for others); legs match presumed input thin positions (3 per structure), not vertically filled; no overlaps or misses, all structures detected/drawn.
 * Differences from expected: Without the actual test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but the output does not look fully correct—crossbars create uneven, dotted patterns (e.g., 4's row 9 has isolated 4's at 7/9, resembling incomplete digit but overwriting thin intent; spacing every-2 from right feels arbitrary and may not match puzzle rules for "completion"); if expected is full rectangles or vertical leg fills, this partially matches (bars/legs) but adds unrequested dotted crossbars; if no crossbars needed, this over-draws; looks like digit attempts (2/4/3/1) but 4 appears malformed (right-heavy dots vs. standard left-vertical + full cross); bottom empty rows preserved, which is fine but unprocessed. Overall, detection worked (4 structures found), but rendering (esp. crossbars) likely incorrect, as patterns don't form clean shapes and depend on fragile get_k/s assumptions.
 * The test output makes partial sense (captures structures cleanly except crossbars) but not fully correct—crossbar additions alter thin rows unexpectedly, and right-aligned every-2 may be a misinterpretation (e.g., perhaps crossbars should be full, left-aligned, or absent; or k based on num_thin instead of c/s/l); accounts for multiple stacked but assumes fixed width/positions.

[2025-10-02 05:40:53] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are **obviously consistent across EVERY example**. These are limited to direct, observable relationships between elements (e.g., color propagation, property transformations like holes/pixels, positional containment) that appear in all cases without variation or inconsistency. Only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., scattered small input elements without output effects, background input properties) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., exact determination of *how many* 1-pixel elements to add, or precise positioning logic within the inner shape) are noted as such rather than speculated.

#### 1. **Outer Frame Color → Added 1-Pixel Element Color (Per Frame Level)**
   - **Description**: The color of each outer frame (the large holes=1, pixels=28 shape at each vertical level: top/middle/bottom) directly determines the color of small 1-pixel (pixels=1, holes=0) elements added inside its corresponding inner shape.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color propagation (outer affects inner contents).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top outer Yellow → added Yellow 1px elements (2 total); Middle outer Maroon → added Maroon 1px (4 total); Bottom outer Red → added Red 1px (1 total).
     - Train 2: Top outer Blue → added Blue 1px (1 total); Middle outer Pink → added Pink 1px (3 total); Bottom outer Yellow → added Yellow 1px (2 total).
     - Train 3: Top outer Red → added Red 1px (0 total, i.e., no addition); Middle outer Yellow → added Yellow 1px (2 total); Bottom outer Blue → added Blue 1px (2 total).
   - **Positional Connection**: Added elements are always contained within the bbox of their paired inner shape (e.g., top inner bbox y-range includes added y-positions in all cases).
   - **Unknown**: Logic for exact number of 1px elements (varies: 0-4; possibly influenced by input small elements like pixel counts or positions, but not consistently explainable).

#### 2. **Number of Added 1-Pixel Elements → Inner Shape Holes Increase**
   - **Description**: The number (N) of 1-pixel elements added inside an inner shape (the large holes=0, pixels=27 filled shape at each level) causes the inner shape's holes property to increase by exactly N.
   - **Interaction Type**: Count-based transformation (added elements create "holes" in inner).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top inner holes 0 → 2 (N=2); Middle 0 → 4 (N=4); Bottom 0 → 1 (N=1).
     - Train 2: Top inner holes 0 → 1 (N=1); Middle 0 → 3 (N=3); Bottom 0 → 2 (N=2).
     - Train 3: Top inner holes 0 → 0 (N=0); Middle 0 → 2 (N=2); Bottom 0 → 2 (N=2).
   - **Positional Connection**: Transformation only affects the inner shape containing the added elements (no cross-level effects observed consistently).
   - **Note**: Applies even when N=0 (no change).

#### 3. **Number of Added 1-Pixel Elements → Inner Shape Pixels Decrease**
   - **Description**: The number (N) of 1-pixel elements added inside an inner shape causes the inner shape's pixels property to decrease by exactly N (from baseline ~27).
   - **Interaction Type**: Count-based transformation (added elements "remove" pixels from inner, possibly representing subtraction or overwriting).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top inner pixels 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2); Middle 27 → 23 (Δ=-4, N=4); Bottom 27 → 26 (Δ=-1, N=1).
     - Train 2: Top inner 27 → 26 (Δ=-1, N=1); Middle 27 → 24 (Δ=-3, N=3); Bottom 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2).
     - Train 3: Top inner 27 → 27 (Δ=0, N=0); Middle 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2); Bottom 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2).
   - **Positional Connection**: Tied to containment within the inner shape's bbox (added elements' positions are internal, e.g., x-coordinates like 7/9 or 6/8/10 align within inner x-range).
   - **Note**: Applies even when N=0 (no change). Outer frames' pixels/holes remain unchanged (28/1) in all cases.

#### 4. **Top-Level Inner Shape Color → Output Background Color**
   - **Description**: The color of the top-level inner shape (uppermost holes=0/~27 element) directly sets the color of the output background (the large enclosing shape with high holes and pixels, bbox ~[0,0,22,*]).
   - **Interaction Type**: Color propagation (top inner overrides/dominates background).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top inner Blue → output background Blue.
     - Train 2: Top inner Maroon → output background Maroon.
     - Train 3: Top inner Green → output background Green.
   - **Property Connection**: Background holes consistently set to 3 in output (from varying input values: 12→3, 11→3, 8→3), but pixel increase varies (+28, +27, +30) and is unknown (not tied to a clear consistent count).
   - **Positional Connection**: Background encloses all frames; no effect on inner/outer properties.
   - **Unknown**: Exact pixel change logic for background (increases but not by fixed amount or clear input link).

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No Cross-Level Interactions**: No consistent effects between frames (e.g., middle never affects top/bottom properties across all trains).
- **Input Small Elements**: Scattered small shapes (e.g., pixels=2-8, various colors/positions outside frames) disappear in outputs and may influence N (e.g., their pixel counts or positions correlating with added 1px numbers), but this is not consistently explainable (e.g., Train 1 has multiple small Yellow/Green/Maroon, but only specific counts added; varies per train).
- **Irrelevant Elements Excluded**: Background input properties (beyond color override), outer frame stability, and non-frame small elements show no consistent output interactions. Symbols/L-shapes mentioned in high-level description do not map to consistent data properties (e.g., no uniform "cross" or "×" via pixels/holes/bbox across trains).
- **No Transformations Explained Beyond These**: Bbox shifts (e.g., Train 2 uses [2,2,12,6] vs. [1,1,11,5]) or exact 1px positions (e.g., y often mid-inner row, x centered but varies) are not consistently tied to inputs; called unknown. No movement/color changes for outers or non-added elements.

[2025-10-02 05:42:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple embedded "frame" structures (rectangular borders of consistent color, 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, against a uniform background), where each frame contains a unique inner pattern made of the frame's color on background spaces, and the task appears to be cleaning the grid by preserving the full frame borders and their specific inner patterns while removing extraneous non-background elements (noise) outside the frames to produce a clean output with only the frames and their contents.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames always consist of top and bottom rows that are fully uniform in the frame color (11 consecutive cells != background), with vertical sides only on the three inner rows (leftmost and rightmost cells of the frame color), and the immediate inner spaces on those side rows must be background to confirm a valid empty-border structure.
 * Inner patterns (on the three middle rows, especially the center row) vary per frame and represent specific designs (e.g., sparse dots like two isolated color cells, dense alternating color/background like every other cell, or sparser placements like a single offset dot or clustered fills); these must be preserved exactly, not erased or generically replaced.
 * Background color is always g[0][0], and the grid width is odd (23 columns), affecting positioning; frames are non-overlapping and start at column 1 in examples, but detection must scan generally.
 * Noise removal should only target non-background elements outside detected frames (e.g., small disconnected components or artifacts not part of any frame); blindly erasing all non-marked non-background cells destroys valid inner patterns.
 * Subtlety: Detection assumes inner rows (dr=1 to 3) have all inner cells (j=1 to 9) as background during detection, which works for empty frames but fails if patterns exist in input (as they do); this means detection must happen before patterns are present or use a different approach to identify frames without requiring empty inners.
 * Frames may have borders that blend with adjacent background in some cases (e.g., extra background cells around), but the uniform 11-cell top/bottom is key.
 * Patterns are only on the middle row in many cases (r_start + 2), but side rows may have fills (e.g., in train2, side inners have color fills extending from borders).
 * Easy to miss: Inner patterns can connect to borders in input (e.g., touching sides), so removal logic must avoid flood-fill or connectivity checks that could erase them; also, multiple frames per grid, with varying colors (2,4,8,1,3,6).
 * Overall goal seems to "complete" or clean frames by ensuring borders are solid and inners are as per some rule (possibly Morse-like or binary representation), but examples suggest preserving input patterns while zeroing external noise.
 * Grid height ~23-28 rows, with empty background rows separating frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg and is useful; no issues.)

```python
def is_uniform(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start: int, length: int, color: int) -> bool:
    for j in range(start, start + length):
        if g[r][j] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This is helpful for checking solid border lines; accurate and reusable for top/bottom detection.)

```python
def detect_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    frames = []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows - 4):
        for start in range(cols - 10):
            color = g[r][start]
            if color != bg and is_uniform(g, r, start, 11, color):
                if is_uniform(g, r + 4, start, 11, color):
                    good = True
                    for dr in range(1, 4):
                        rr = r + dr
                        if g[rr][start] != color or g[rr][start + 10] != color:
                            good = False
                            break
                        for j in range(1, 10):
                            if g[rr][start + j] != bg:
                                good = False
                                break
                        if not good:
                            break
                    if good:
                        frames.append((r, start, color))
    return frames
```
(This detects frame positions and colors accurately when inners are empty during check, but breaks on inputs with pre-existing patterns since it requires inner rows to be all bg; partially helpful but needs modification to ignore inner non-bg for detection or detect after masking.)

```python
def mark_borders(g: List[List[int]], frames: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[bool]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    marked = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    for r_start, c_start, _ in frames:
        for j in range(c_start, c_start + 11):
            marked[r_start][j] = True
            marked[r_start + 4][j] = True
        for dr in range(1, 4):
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start] = True
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start + 10] = True
    return marked
```
(This correctly marks only borders; useful for protecting frame outlines during cleanup, but does not mark inner patterns, which is good if we want to preserve them separately.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Detection of frames works partially (e.g., identifies positions and colors for simple cases like train1 first frame), but fails for cases where inner patterns exist during detection (e.g., train2 and train3, where non-bg in middle rows prevents 'good=True').
 * Removal logic (remove_small_components) erases all non-border non-bg cells, including valid inner patterns, leading to empty inners in output; this destroys the puzzle's core (preserving patterns) and is a major flaw.
 * add_dots function adds generic 2 dots per frame in fixed positions (columns ~7 and 9 relative to left inner, on middle row), which coincidentally matches train1 first frame's sparse pattern but fails for dense/alternating patterns (e.g., train1 second frame missing full 1-8-1-8... alternation, only has sparse 8's at ~7,9,11) and sparser ones (e.g., train1 third frame missing the single offset 2 at col9, adds wrong ones at 7 and 9).
 * In train1: First frame correct by coincidence (dots match expected sparse pattern), but second frame incorrect (generated has isolated 8's at col7,9,11 on middle row instead of full alternating 8-1 across col1-11); third frame incorrect (no inner 2's added on middle row, expected single 2 at col9).
 * In train2: Detection likely failed for all frames (tops/bottoms not fully uniform color due to mixed borders/inners, e.g., top row2 has 8 borders + 1 inners, not uniform 1), so no marking/removal/add, output keeps input as-is with noise; differs from expected where inners are cleaned to specific patterns (e.g., middle row4 has 1 at col10 and col12 misplaced? Expected has 1's only at sides and specific inner spots, but generated has extra 1's and wrong 8 placements in sides).
 * In train3: Similar detection issues (e.g., first frame's middle row has inner 2's, failing uniformity check on inners==bg); generated keeps some inners but incorrectly (e.g., third frame middle row has 1's everywhere inner, expected has isolated 1 at col9); second frame middle row generated [3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,4,3,...] has sparse 4's, expected full alternating 4-3-4...).
 * Overall, no training example fully correct; program understands frame structure but mishandles preservation (erases inners, adds wrong generic dots).
 * Function remove_small_components is broken for this puzzle (erases valid content, not just small/external noise; do not use as-is, needs connectivity check or frame-containment logic).
 * Function add_dots is unhelpful/not relevant (assumes generic dots, ignores unique patterns; discard for future, as patterns seem input-derived or rule-based like binary/Morse).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have detected some frames (borders preserved for all four: 2's at top, 4's, 3's, 1's at bottom) but erased most inner patterns and added incorrect sparse dots (e.g., for top 2's frame, middle row3 has 2's at col7,9,11 but expected likely full or different pattern like alternating or clustered based on training style; similarly for 4's middle row9: 4's at col7,9,11 sparse, but training shows denser for similar colors; 3's and 1's have similar sparse adds missing expected sparser/single placements).
 * Extra background rows at bottom are clean (good), but inners are overly simplified/erased (e.g., no dense fills seen in train2 style), and some side rows have lingering 8's that should be bg if noise; does not match expected clean preservation of unique patterns per frame.
 * To handle test, need to preserve input inners within frame bounds (e.g., mark entire frame rect including inners, then remove only external non-bg); current output looks like partial erasure + wrong adds, leaving incomplete patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain partial or outlined "symbols" (likely letters or shapes) formed by aligned vertical "legs" (spans of the same non-background color) in three consecutive rows, flanked by full top and bottom bars of the same color; the program must detect these alignments and complete the 5-row-high symbol by filling specific internal patterns unique to each color (1,2,3,4,6,8), while removing any small disconnected components at the end. The background color is the most common in the grid, and symbols are drawn on a background-filled output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Symbols span exactly 5 rows: a full top bar (row s), three rows of "legs" (rows s+1 to s+3, where legs are vertical non-background spans separated by background, at least 10 units wide in the examples), and a full bottom bar (row s+4); only alignments where all three legs overlap in the same columns and match top/bottom bars trigger drawing.
 * Internal patterns vary by color and are not uniform: e.g., for color 4, the third leg row (s+3, 0-indexed within block) has isolated fills at specific offsets like columns 7,9,11; for color 8, the second leg row has a dotted pattern every other column (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9,11); for color 2, the third leg row has fills at column 9 and 11; for color 1, similar dotted or offset patterns in middle rows; these seem to resemble letterforms (e.g., 4 like 'A' with crossbar, 8 like 'B' with curves, 2 like 'Z' with diagonal).
 * Leg detection must handle "clean" separations: a leg starts with color c, followed by background gap (at least 1?), then another c, but the code's find_legs looks for c, then background(s), then c again with no non-bg in gap, and requires span >=10; however, it skips if extra c's appear immediately after, and it doesn't correctly identify multi-leg structures or varying widths.
 * The "k" value for filling central patterns depends on color but also subtly on position (l, s) or size; current get_k is ad-hoc and incorrect (e.g., for c=4, it uses c//2+1=3, but expected patterns suggest more/less fills; for c=2, it varies by s==1, but examples show consistent per-color logic).
 * Background is correctly the mode color (1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test), but output starts fully bg-filled.
 * Post-processing removes components <20 cells, which is helpful to clean noise but may remove intended small parts if patterns have thin elements; in examples, it doesn't affect mains but could if internals are sparse.
 * Grids are ~22x23, with symbols left-aligned (starting col~1), separated by bg rows; multiple symbols per grid (e.g., train1 has 4,8,2; test has 2,4,3,1).
 * Subtle: Patterns may step inward or have offsets (e.g., effective_r = l+10 assumes fixed 10-width, but legs vary); filling in mid_row (s+2) goes left every 2 steps for k times, but expected shows right-side or centered dots/bars; for some colors (3?), no internals needed, just frame.
 * Overlaps or adjacent symbols must not interfere (e.g., train3 has 2,4,1 with bg=3, no bleed).
 * Easy to miss: Legs aren't always full-height in input (input shows only legs, program adds top/bottom/internals); detection requires exact column overlap across three rows; colors are digits 1-8, bg varies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the most common color, used in all examples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This verifies full bars, essential for top/bottom checks; works but assumes exact span match.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))
    size = 1
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(This flood-fill computes connected component size and cells; very helpful for final cleanup of small noise <20 cells, as used in program; prevents false positives from tiny blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects background and initializes output as full bg.
 * It identifies leg positions in rows s+1 to s+3 via find_legs (which looks for c-bg(s)-c patterns with clean bg gap and span>=10), finds common column overlaps across three rows, and verifies top/bottom full bars— this works for positioning the outer frames (top full, bottom full, left/right sides in mid rows) in all training examples and test.
 * For train1 (bg=1, symbols at ~rows1-5 for4,7-11 for8,13-17 for2): Outer frames drawn correctly (e.g., full 4's top/bottom cols1-11, sides at col1/11 in rows2-4; similar for8 cols1-11,2 cols1-11), and small component removal doesn't erase mains.
 * For train2 (bg=8, symbols at ~rows2-6 for1? but actually1's are thin, then8-12 for6,14-18 for4): Frames correct (e.g.,6's top/bottom full cols2-12, sides col2/12;4's similar), but note train2 input likely has legs for1,6,4.
 * For train3 (bg=3, symbols at ~rows1-5 for2,7-11 for4,13-17 for1): Frames correct (e.g.,2's cols1-11, etc.).
 * Test output: Detects and frames symbols correctly for2 (rows1-5 cols1-11),4 (7-11),3 (13-17? but3 is solid? wait, legs for3?),1 (19-23 cols1-11), with bg=8 and separations.
 * What didn't work: Internal patterns completely missing or wrong in all cases—program only draws left side (col l), right side (col r in rows s+1,s+3; effective_r=l+10 in s+2), and a backward every-2-step fill in s+2 for k steps (based on flawed get_k, e.g., for c=4 k=3 so fills 3 positions left from l+10, but expected has forward/right-side isolated fills like col7,9,11 in row s+3 for4).
 * Specific differences: Train1 for4 block (rows~1-5): Generated has empty internals (only sides), expected has in row3 (s+2?): 4 at cols7,9,11; row4 (s+3): nothing extra but wait, expected row3 has 4 at1,7,9,11? (mismatch in which row); for8 block row9 (s+2 for8): generated empty, expected 8 at3,5,7,9,11 (dotted); for2 block row15 (s+2): generated empty, expected 2 at9,11. Train2 for1 block (rows~2-6): generated has sides only (but1's expected has internals in row4:1 at9? from pattern), diff: missing dots at col9,11 in row4; for6 block row10 (s+2): empty vs expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11? wait row10 expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11 (full row11? no, row10 is s+2 with dots); for4 block row16 (s+2): empty vs expected 4 at9,11. Train3 similar misses: for4 row9 empty vs expected 4 at7,9,11; for1 row15 empty vs expected 1 at7,9,11. Reasons unknown but likely wrong filling logic (backward vs forward, wrong row, wrong k/positions).
 * find_legs is partially helpful (detects spans) but broken: it requires exact c-bg-c with no extras, skips if post-gap has immediate c, assumes fixed ~10 width via effective_r=l+10 (but legs vary, e.g., train1 4's legs cols1-1? no, legs are single-col? wait, input legs are thin verticals at edges, but code treats as wide span); it misses multi-col legs or non-10 widths, leading to wrong effective_r and common sets.
 * get_k is unhelpful/broken: ad-hoc rules don't match patterns (e.g., c=1 uses l which is position, but patterns are fixed per color; c=2 depends on s==1, but train1/3 2's at different s have similar patterns; c=3=1, but train3 1's? wait 1's pattern; c=8=6 fixed, but expected dots suggest variable).
 * Overall, core detection works (positions/frames), but internals fail due to wrong pattern logic, wrong widths, and no per-color templates; small removal is fine but irrelevant here as no noise shown.
 * Program loops s in 0 to h-5, checks legs in s+1..s+3, good for multiple blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output frames the symbols correctly (e.g., full top/bottom for each block, sides at col1/11 or similar, separations with bg=8 rows), matching the structure of training examples, but lacks all internal patterns, just like the training failures—e.g., for the 2 block (rows1-5), expected likely has dots/bars in row3 or4 (similar to train1's 2 with fills at9,11); for4 (rows7-11), missing crossbar-like fills (e.g., at7,9,11); for3 (rows13-17), possibly solid or minimal but code draws frame only; for1 (rows19-23), missing dotted internals (e.g., every other from right). This does not look correct because training expects color-specific internals (dots, bars) inside the frames, not empty; the output resembles incomplete outlines, failing to "complete" the symbols as in expected trains. To handle test, need per-color pattern templates (e.g., dict of fill positions/rows) instead of generic k-fill, and better leg width detection (not fixed +10).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with background cells and incomplete "balloon" or "blob" shapes made of colored cells (non-background). The goal is to detect specific 5-row high patterns (full horizontal span at top and bottom, thin vertical connections on the sides in the three middle rows) and complete them by filling a patterned interior in the central middle row (row start+2) using a color-specific pattern, then remove any remaining small connected components (size <20) that aren't part of valid completed shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows tall: a starting row with a horizontal span of >=10 consecutive cells of the same color (non-bg), a bottom row (start+4) that is fully filled with that color across the exact same span (no gaps, sides must align), and three middle rows (start+1 to start+3) that are "thin" (only the leftmost and rightmost cells of the span are the shape's color, with all interior cells strictly background; no extra colors or protrusions inside or outside the span in those rows).
 * Filling happens only in the exact central middle row (start+2), using a stepped pattern (every 2 cells starting from a color-specific offset within the span); the pattern must not overwrite existing side cells but adds interior ones. Different colors have unique offsets and patterns (e.g., color 8: dense alternating fill starting from left; color 4: sparser fill starting ~6 cells from left, adding 3 interior cells at positions like 7,9,11 for span 1-11; color 2: even sparser, starting ~8 from left, adding 2 interior cells like 9,11; color 1 similar to 4 but sometimes skips some positions; color 6: alternating but denser than 4, starting earlier). Over-filling (e.g., adding extra cells not in expected) breaks the pattern.
 * A key condition is that fewer than 3 of the middle rows can have "interfering" elements outside the span (i.e., cells that are non-bg and not the shape's color); if >=3 middle rows have such interference (e.g., parts of other shapes), don't fill to avoid corrupting adjacent objects. Shapes must not overlap or interfere horizontally in middle rows.
 * Background is always the most common cell value across the entire grid (via flat count); assume rectangular grid, all rows same width.
 * After all fills, perform 4-way connected flood-fill (up/down/left/right, same color only) to identify components and erase any with total size <20 cells (prevents noise or incomplete partials from remaining, but completed shapes are large enough ~28+ cells even unfilled due to connections, larger after fill).
 * Subtle: Spans must be exact matches top-to-bottom (same left/right positions); multiple shapes per grid, separated by bg; detection scans from top (start_row 0 to h-5); input likely has outlines already (full top/bottom + side stubs in middles), but fill only adds interior pattern if all conditions met—missing sides in input would fail "thin" check. Easy to miss: vertical connectivity makes unfilled shapes survive size check (~28 cells via top bar + bottom bar + 6 side cells); patterns are asymmetric or offset per color, not uniform; removal happens post-all-fills on a copy to avoid interfering with detection.
 * Grids are ~23x23, but generalize; no diagonal connections; only horizontal spans trigger (no vertical or diagonal patterns).

        else:
            i += 1
    return None
```
(Helpful: Finds the first horizontal run of >=10 non-bg cells in a row, returns color + exact left/right bounds; critical for span detection, but assumes only one qualifying span per row—may miss if multiples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Verifies exact span is solidly filled with color, no bg or other intrusions; key for bottom row check.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= w:
        return False
    if row[left] != color or row[right] != color:
        return False
    for k in range(left + 1, right):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Confirms "thin neck" structure—sides present, interior strictly bg; essential for all three middle rows, fails if sides missing or interior cluttered.)

```python
def has_other_in_row(row: List[int], color: int, bg: int, left: int, right: int, w: int) -> bool:

            continue
        if row[k] != bg and row[k] != color:
            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful: Detects interference outside span in a row (non-bg, non-shape-color cells); used to count per middle row, ensures <3 rows affected before filling.)

```
(Helpful: 4-way flood-fill to compute connected component size and cells for a starting cell/color; crucial for post-process removal of small blobs <20; returns size and set of positions for targeted erasure.)

The `fill_row` function from the attempt is partially helpful (applies stepped pattern based on color) but broken in offsets/steps for some colors (e.g., overfills for color=1, underfills/skips for color=6; returns early for unknown colors, preventing any fill).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it demonstrates partial understanding: correctly detects bg, scans for 5-row structures via span/full/thin checks, applies color-specific stepped fills in middle row, and removes small components post-fill.
 * Worked: Structure detection logic (span >=10, exact bottom full, all middle thin, interference <3 rows) is solid in concept; removal via flood-fill correctly preserves large connected shapes (e.g., unfilled balloon ~28 cells via top/bottom bars + sides survives >20 threshold); patterns match exactly for some cases (e.g., train2 color=4 adds correct 8,10,12; train1 color=8 alternating if triggered; train1 color=4 adds 7,9,11 matching expected).
 * Didn't work: Fill never triggers in any training output (generated matches input outlines exactly—no interior patterns added), likely due to implementation bug (e.g., is_thin fails silently if input middles lack sides, but generated shows sides present, suggesting input already has outlines and detection skips for unknown reason like span bounds mismatch or loop indexing error); for train1, expected adds patterns to row3 (4's: +7,9,11), row9 (8's: alternating 1,3,5,7,9,11), row16 (2's: +9,11), but generated has only sides everywhere; for train2, expected adds to row4 (1's: +10,12 but code would wrongly add 8,10,12), row10 (6's: alternating 2,6,8,10,12 but code skips entirely via else return), row16 (4's: +8,10,12 matching but not added), generated only sides; for train3, expected adds denser patterns (4's row9: +5,7,9,11 but code only +7,9,11 missing 5; 1's row15: +5,7,9,11 but code +7,9,11 missing 5; 2's no fill needed, matches generated), but generated only sides (no adds anywhere); subtle: code's offsets (e.g., +6 for 1/4, +8 for 2, 0 for 8) are close but incomplete/wrong for 1/6 (needs adjustment like +4 or different step for density); num_with_other <3 prevents false positives but may over-block if minor interference.
 * Missed: Handling all colors (e.g., no pattern for 6, partial for 1/2/4 across examples); potential bug in triggering fill (e.g., range(h-4) misses lower shapes if h small; assumes first span only, may skip if multiple); doesn't add missing sides if input lacks them (but generated suggests input has them).
 * extract_objects not present, but compute_component_size serves as essential tool for post-removal (would be useful pre-process to isolate shapes).
 * fill_row is partially helpful for patterned fill but broken/not general (hardcoded offsets fail for train3 4's/1's by missing positions like +5; skips unknown colors; step=2 too rigid—some patterns may need step=1 or variable).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it replicates the input outlines (full top/bottom spans + thin sides in all three middle rows for each of four shapes: 2's rows1-5, 4's rows7-11, 3's rows13-17, 1's rows19-23) with no interior fills added, similar to all training generated outputs; based on training expecteds, it should add color-specific patterns to the central middle row (start+2) for each shape if conditions met (e.g., for 2's row3: add ~9,11 as in train1; for 4's row9: add ~7,9,11 or denser per train3; for 3's row15: unknown pattern but likely some interior like others; for 1's row21: add ~7,9,11 or denser). No small components removed (but none qualify as shapes are connected >20 even unfilled). This suggests same trigger failure as training (no changes), making output incomplete—expected would have patterned interiors (e.g., sparse dots/clusters per color) while preserving outlines and bg=8 elsewhere; without fills, shapes remain "incomplete" per puzzle rules. Do not look correct because they ignore the core completion step, leaving all shapes as mere outlines (mismatches all training expecteds' patterned bodies); to handle test, must fix trigger (e.g., verify input has sides, adjust offsets for 3/1 if similar to 4), ensure patterns match example densities (e.g., test 3's may need custom like alternating or +4 offset).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x23 grid (or similar dimensions) where the goal is to identify specific "frame" structures (hollow 5x11 rectangles of a single color with a fully background-filled 3x9 interior) made of non-background colors, erase all other non-background elements (treating them as noise or irrelevant components), and then repopulate the middle row of each frame's interior with a specific number of 1x1 "dots" of the frame's color. The number of dots (n) is determined by counting small connected components (1-8 cells, with bonuses for 2x2 or 3x3 filled squares) of the same color elsewhere in the grid, and the dots are placed right-aligned in the interior columns (1-9 relative to frame left), preferring opposite-parity columns to the frame's right edge first, then same-parity if needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the color in the top-left cell (e.g., 1 in training 1/2, 3 in training 3, 8 in test); all processing ignores it.
 * Frames must be exactly 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, with 25-30 cells total (hollow border), and the exact 3x9 interior (rows t+1 to t+3, cols l+1 to l+9) must be entirely background—no partial fills or leaks.
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), strictly same-color; frames are identified as the large border components meeting size/bbox/internal criteria.
 * For n (dots to place): Base count is number of small components (1-8 cells) of color c outside the frame; add (size-1) extra for each fully filled square component of 2x2 (add 1) or 3x3 (add 2). This seems to represent "values" or "morse-like" encodings from small blobs elsewhere.
 * Placement: In the frame's middle interior row (t+2), place n dots of color c in columns l+1 to l+9, right-aligned (highest columns first). Prioritize columns with parity opposite to the frame's right edge column (iright % 2), taking the rightmost n such; if n exceeds available opposite-parity slots (up to 5), spill to rightmost same-parity columns. No overlaps or extensions beyond interior.
 * All other non-background cells (not in any frame) must be erased to background before placing dots; frames themselves remain intact.
 * Subtleties: Parity-based placement ensures "alternating" or "gapped" positioning to match visual patterns (e.g., avoiding adjacent dots if possible); small components might be single cells, lines, or squares, but only filled squares get bonuses—irregular shapes count as 1 regardless of size (1-8). Frames don't overlap or nest. Grid edges are all background except frames. No rotation or diagonal connections. The middle row is always row index t+2 (0-based).
 * Easy to miss: Internal check must be exactly 27 background cells (3*9); frames might have slight variations in border thickness but must fit exact bbox. Counting skips the frame itself when tallying small components for n. Placement can leave gaps if n < 9, but always right-justified with parity preference. Background fill happens after component detection but before dot placement. Test grids may have more frames (4 in test vs. 3 in trainings) and different color orders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This is helpful and correct; uses DFS stack for 4-connected same-color components, essential for extracting all objects/frames.)

            m = t + 2
            frames.append((t, l, c, m, comp))
    return frames
```
(This is mostly helpful; correctly identifies frames by size, bbox, and exact internal background count (27 cells). Minor issue: internal loop uses min_j +10, which is correct for 9 cols (1 to 9), but ensure no border bleed.)

```python
def fill_non_frame_cells(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, frame_cells: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all non-background cells not part of frames with background color."""

        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != bg and (i, j) not in frame_cells:
                output[i][j] = bg
    return output
```
(This is helpful and correct; clears noise while preserving frames, using a set for fast lookup—essential step before dot placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identified frames in all training examples (correct 5x11 bbox, size 25-30, full internal bg) and cleared non-frame cells to background, preserving frame borders intact.
 * Correctly grouped components by color using defaultdict(list), skipping the frame itself when counting small components for n.
 * Training example 2 passed fully, indicating the logic works for some patterns (likely where n=0 or simple right-aligned placement without spillover).
 * Failed in training 1: For color 4 frame (rows 1-5, cols 1-11), generated middle row (row 3) as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11? shifted left] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3 positions?]; for color 8 (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,8] (dense left with extras) vs expected [1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8] (alternating starting from col 1, 6 dots). Suggests n overcounted (too many dots) and/or wrong columns selected (not parity-preferred right-aligned).
 * Failed in training 3: For color 4 frame (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11—shifted] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3]; for color 1 (rows 13-17), generated row 15 as [1 at cols 7,9,11—only 3] but expected has 1 at cols 7,9,11 (wait, appears similar, but actual diff is in row 15 matching but perhaps n=3 correct while earlier frames wrong); overall, placement shifted left, ignoring parity (e.g., if iright even, prefer odd cols rightmost).
 * compute_n_for_color overcounts or miscounts small components: Counts all 1-8 cell comps as +1, and filled 2x2/3x3 as +(ww-1), but in training 1 for color 8, there might be small blobs worth n=6 (alternating), but generated placed 8+ incorrectly; unknown if bonuses applied wrong (e.g., treating lines as squares).
 * get_placement_columns has parity logic but buggy: For iright even (e.g., l+10 even if l even), opp_par=odd, takes rightmost n odds (e.g., 9,7,5,...), but in generated, it places in even cols or leftward, suggesting wrong sorting or spillover (poss_opp[-n:] takes last n, which are rightmost if list is left-to-right).
 * program main flow is solid (bg -> comps -> frames -> group by color -> clear noise -> place dots per frame), but dot placement fails due to n miscalculation and column selection errors.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, but compute_n_for_color and get_placement_columns need fixes (e.g., verify filled square detection: check if hh==ww and pp==hh*ww and 2<=ww<=3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 4 frames (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23), clears all noise (e.g., no stray cells outside frames), and preserves borders, with background 8 everywhere else. However, interior fillings are wrong or incomplete: For color 2 (n likely 0, no small 2-blobs elsewhere), middle row 3 is all bg—correct (empty). For color 4 (row 9), generated [4,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,4] (dense with left bias, 6+ dots?) vs likely expected alternating right-aligned (e.g., 4 at cols 1,3,5,7,9 or rightmost 5 if n=5, but pattern looks like overcounted n=6 without parity, placing adjacently). For color 3 (row 15), [3 at col 9 only? sparse] suggests undercounted n=1, but if small 3-blobs exist (e.g., single or 2x2), expected might need 2-3 rightmost opposite-parity. For color 1 (row 21), [1 at cols 9,11? but extended] looks like n=2 but wrong columns (should be rightmost, e.g., 8+1=9 if odd preferred). Overall, placements are not right-aligned with parity (e.g., favors left/even cols), leading to non-alternating patterns; does not match visual consistency of trainings (e.g., expected would have gapped, right-heavy dots). Missing: Proper spillover handling if n>5, and exact n from small comps (test has potential 2x2/3x3 bonuses unseen).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detecting and reconstructing specific 5-row-high "ladder" or "table-like" structures in a grid, where each structure consists of colored bars and legs on a uniform background (8), and the output is a cleaned or redrawn version of the input grid with only valid structures rendered while ignoring or blanking invalid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must span exactly 11 columns (full top and bottom bars), with thin legs only at the exact left and right ends in the three middle rows (no extra colors in between, which must be background).
 * Background is determined from the top-left cell; all non-structure areas in output are filled with background.
 * Middle row (row s+2) includes a crossbar connecting the legs, with length varying by color c: for c=1, it's position-dependent (4 - l); for c=2, it's 1 or 2 segments based on a side parameter s (possibly start position); for c>=3, it's roughly c//2 + 1 segments, placed from the right end and stepping left by 2 columns each time.
 * Structures cannot overlap or extend beyond grid height (must fit within h-4 rows from start s); once detected and drawn, mark the 5 rows as visited to skip reprocessing.
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from top, finds candidate top bars of exactly length 11 in input row s, validates middle rows for thinness (only ends colored with c, rest background), and bottom row for full span of c.
 * Subtlety: Crossbar drawing starts from right end (r) and extends left in even steps (pos -= 2), which can create asymmetric or partial connections (e.g., for higher c, more rungs; for c=1/2, shorter or conditional).
 * Only process non-visited rows; break after drawing one structure per starting row block to avoid multiples.
 * Easy to miss: Bars must be exactly contiguous length 11 (no longer/shorter); thin check is strict (any non-bg in middle leg rows invalidates); crossbar count k can be miscalculated for edge cases like l/r positions or low c values.
 * Input may have noisy or incomplete structures, so output reinitializes to bg and redraws only validated ones.
 * Grid width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

(Core drawing logic; builds full structure including variable crossbar. Note: crossbar always includes endpoints, then adds k-? internals stepping left from r.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Prevents reprocessing drawn blocks; essential for non-overlapping detection.)

The main program orchestrates: init output to bg, scan rows, find/validate/draw/mark.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken, but get_k may be flawed for c=2 (s param is start row index, but logic "1 if s==1 else 2" seems arbitrary/unrelated to puzzle—possibly incorrect for test cases where s varies; could lead to inconsistent crossbars). find_bars skips bg correctly but assumes bars start after bg runs; might miss if bar touches edge (but i starts at 0, so okay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it successfully detected and redrew structures for all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection (11-bar top/bottom, thin legs) works for simple cases.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety in crossbar for c=2/1 not tested in training—could be why test needs review.
 * Visited marking and single-break per block prevented over-drawing in training.
 * No omissions or mismatches in training (all passed), but unknown if training had variable crossbars.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows four vertically stacked, non-overlapping 5-row structures (for c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), each with full top/bottom 11-cell bars starting at col=1, thin legs at col=1 and col=11 for the three middle rows, and background elsewhere; separated by all-bg rows (0,6,12,18,24-26).
 * For c=2 and c=3: Middle row (row 3 for first, 9 for second? Wait, for c=2: row 3 has only col1=2 and col11=2 (thin, no crossbar fill); same for c=3 at row 15 (only ends).
 * For c=4: Middle row 9 has col1=4, col7=4, col9=4, col11=4 (three internal fills, stepping left from 11: pos=11,9,7 >=1).
 * For c=1: Middle row 21 has col1=1, col7=1, col9=1, col11=1 (same pattern as c=4).
 * This looks mostly correct assuming input had these structures (program redrew cleanly on bg); crossbars match get_k logic (for c=4: 4//2+1=3 segments; for c=1: if l=1, 4-1=3 segments; for c=3: 3//2+1=2, but output shows only ends—wait, discrepancy: for c=3 middle row 15: only col1=3, col11=3, no internals like col9 or col7, so crossbar not filled beyond legs, suggesting get_k(3,l=1,s=13)=2 but drawing only added 0 internals? Wait, drawing always sets l and r, then adds k more stepping left, but if k=2, it should set pos=11 (already r), pos=9; but output lacks col9=3, so either input didn't validate or get_k miscomputed (s=13 !=1, but for c=3 uses general formula). For c=2 at s=1: get_k=1 if s==1, so adds 1 more (pos=11 already, then pos=9=2), but output row3 has no col9=2—only ends, so crossbar addition failed or k=0 effectively. Thus, test output does NOT fully match expected clean redraw: missing internal crossbar fills for c=2/3 (only legs drawn, no rungs), while c=1/4 have them; this differs from expected (should have partial rungs per color formula), likely due to get_k bug for c=2 (conditional on s==1 but doesn't add enough) or drawing loop (count starts after endpoints? No, loop sets pos=r which is already set). For c=3, k=2 should add one internal (pos=9), but absent—unknown why (perhaps validation failed in input, but output shows structure drawn, so partial). Overall, structures detected correctly, but crossbars incomplete for lower c, making output incorrect for full reconstruction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the program must detect incomplete 5-row-high table-like structures (with a full top bar, thin vertical legs in the middle three rows, and a full bottom bar) in an input grid and complete them in the output grid by filling in a specific crossbar pattern in the central middle row (row s+2). The structures are 11 units wide, use a consistent non-background color c for each, and the crossbar consists of c-colored pixels placed every other column starting from the right leg and extending leftward, with the number of crossbar positions determined by rules based on c (to form digit-like or symbolic patterns).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must be exactly 5 rows high (s to s+4), with top (s) and bottom (s+4) rows having exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (non-background), detected via run-length of length 11.
 * Middle three rows (s+1 to s+3) must be "thin" legs: only the left (l) and right (r = l+10) positions are c, with all positions between l+1 and r-1 being background (bg); any non-bg in between invalidates the structure.
 * Background bg is assumed to be the top-left cell value (g[0][0]); output grid starts as all bg and only modified where structures are drawn.
 * Crossbar is only in the exact central middle row (s+2), starting at pos = r and stepping left by 2 (pos -= 2) for k steps, where k depends on c: examples show k=1 for c=1 and c=2 (no visible extra beyond legs), k=2 for c=3 (adds one extra at r-2), k=3 for c=4 (adds two extras at r-2 and r-4), k=4 for c=6 (adds three extras at r-2, r-4, r-6); legs at l and r are always drawn in all middle rows, but crossbar may overlap r.
 * Structures do not overlap; use visited tracking to skip rows already covered (mark s to min(s+4, h) as visited after drawing).
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from 0 to h-5, finds candidate bars only in top row s, validates bottom and middles, then draws if valid; only one structure per starting s (breaks after first valid).
 * Subtlety: Crossbar rule is c-dependent and not simply c//2 +1 (works for c=3,4,6 but overdraws for c=1 with k=3 instead of k=1); special case for c=2 depending on s (k=1 if s==1 else 2) is inconsistent and likely incorrect, as it ties to row position rather than fixed per-c rule.
 * Width w assumed constant across rows; ignore bars shorter/longer than 11 or with length !=11.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar does not fill continuously but skips every other column (step -2 from r); for small k (e.g., 1), it only reinforces the right leg (no new pixels); structures may appear in any order/position but are processed top-to-bottom without reordering.
 * Output must exactly match input's detected parts but complete the crossbars; no drawing if validation fails (e.g., bottom not full, middle not thin).
 * Considerations across attempts: Scanning only unvisited rows prevents overlap; early break after drawing one per s avoids multiples; but get_k overestimates k for low c like 1, leading to extra pixels.

            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Helpful: Draws the full structure if valid; fills top/bottom fully, legs at ends in middles, and crossbar every other from right; bounds-checked for h; but relies on broken get_k.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True

(Helpful: Marks 5 rows as visited to skip overlaps; essential for non-overlapping processing.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, s: int) -> int:  # Current version broken
    if c == 1:
        return 3  # Wrong: should be 1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Inconsistent: should be fixed per c, e.g., 1
    return c // 2 + 1  # Works for c=3,4,6 but not low c
```
(Unhelpful/broken: Overdraws for c=1 (k=3 adds extras at r-2,r-4); special s-dependency for c=2 is arbitrary and likely wrong; needs rewrite to fixed per-c mapping, e.g., k = max(1, c // 2) or empirical: 1->1,2->1,3->2,4->3,6->4.)

The main program function orchestrates: init output/visited, scan s, find bars in g[s], validate full bottom and thin middles, draw if valid, mark visited. (Helpful overall structure, but fails due to get_k.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects structures via 11-long top bars, validates thin legs and full bottom, and draws tops/bottoms/legs accurately, as shown by training examples 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * What worked: For c=4 (k=3), crossbar correctly at r, r-2, r-4 (e.g., columns 12,10,8 plus leg at 2), matching expected; for c=6 (k=4), crossbar at r to r-6 step -2 (12,10,8,6 plus leg 2), matching expected; visited marking prevents overlaps, and thin/full checks are precise.
 * What didn't work: For c=1, get_k returns 3, drawing extra crossbar pixels at r-2=10 and r-4=8 (generated row 4: 1's at columns 2,8,10,12), but expected has only legs at 2 and 12 (no extras); this causes training example 2 to fail entirely due to mismatched middle row.
 * No other attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core detection/drawing logic; issue isolated to get_k for low c (1 and possibly 2).
 * find_bars, is_thin, is_full are essential and correct; draw_structure is mostly helpful but broken via get_k; mark_visited prevents errors in multi-structure grids.
 * get_k is broken/unhelpful in current form (overdraws extras for c=1, arbitrary s-dependency for c=2); don't use without fixing to per-c values (e.g., empirical mapping from examples).
 * Training 2 mismatches only in c=1 crossbar (extras at 8 and 10 unknown why expected omits, but clearly different: generated has four 1's, expected two); for c=4 and c=6, generated matches expected exactly (no differences noted).
 * No omissions or shape mismatches beyond crossbar; blob shapes match where k is correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it applies the same flawed logic: for c=1 (bottom structure, s=19?), k=3 draws extras at columns 7,9,11 (plus leg at 1: 1's at 1,7,9,11 in row 21), but based on training 2, this likely should be only legs at 1 and 11 (no extras, similar error as c=1 in training 2).
 * For c=2 (top structure, s=1), k=1 (due to s==1 special case) draws only at r=11 (already leg), resulting in only legs at 1 and 11 in row 3, which looks correct for a minimal crossbar (matches "1"-like thinness, no extras).
 * For c=4 (second structure, s=7?), k=3 draws at 11,9,7 (plus leg 1: 1,7,9,11 in row 9), which matches the pattern that worked in training 2, so likely correct.
 * For c=3 (third structure, s=13?), k=2 (3//2+1) draws at 11,9 (plus leg 1: 1,9,11 in row 15), which fits the incremental pattern (one extra vs. c=1/2), and looks sensible (no overdraw), likely correct.
 * Overall, test output is consistent with program logic but inherits the c=1 error (extra pixels in bottom structure's middle row); tops/bottoms/legs are correct everywhere; if c=1 should have no extras (as in training 2 expected), then test fails similarly—account for fixed k per c (e.g., 1 for c=1/2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4, 4 for 6) to handle low-c cases without s-dependency.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color B and multiple rectangular frames (borders) of various colors C, each with empty interiors filled with B. The goal is to remove all small connected components (blobs) of non-background colors scattered in the background areas by setting them to B, count the number N of such small blobs per color C (each component counts as 1 regardless of size), and then restore N pixels of color C inside each corresponding frame's interior on the middle row, placed in the rightmost min(N, 4) of 4 possible every-other-column positions (typically odd-offset columns like 3,5,7,9 relative to the frame start).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are fixed-width (11 columns) rectangles of height 4 or 5, with full top/bottom rows of C, side columns of C on inner rows, and interiors entirely B (if not all B, the frame isn't detected).
 * Small components are 4-directionally connected groups of the same non-B color with size 1-8; components larger than 8 are not removed or counted (likely part of frames or ignored).
 * Counting: Each small component of color C contributes exactly 1 to N for that C, regardless of size or shape—no special doubling for 2x2 squares of size 4 (this overcounts and is a key error in the attempt).
 * Placement inside frame: Only on the middle inner row (for height 5: second inner row; for height 4: first inner row). Use 4 possible slots in the 9-column interior, at relative offsets [1,3,5,7] from the left inner edge (fc+1), resulting in global columns fc+2, fc+4, fc+6, fc+8 (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9 if fc=1). Place C in the rightmost min(N,4) of these slots; leave others as B. Limit to 4 max, even if N>4.
 * Subtlety: All examples show frames starting at column 1 (fc=1), but the code searches for them. Background B is g[0][0], assumed consistent.
 * Subtlety: Removals happen across the entire grid (including any erroneous smalls inside frames, but frames are detected only if inner is all B, so inputs likely have empty inners). No smalls of frame color C are inside frames initially.
 * Easy to miss: Connected components use 4 directions (up, down, left, right); diagonals don't count. Visited array prevents recounting. No removal if size >8 or 0.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs preserve the original frames and background; only smalls are erased, and placements are added only inside detected frames.
 * Potential edge: If no smalls for a C (N=0), inner remains all B. If multiple frames of same C, each gets placements based on total N (code accumulates total small_count[C]).
 * Potential edge: Grid sizes vary slightly (e.g., 23x23 vs. 20x23), but frames are consistent. No frames overlapping or adjacent in examples.
 * The test input has frames for colors 1(odd),2(even),3(odd),4(even) with B=8; placements follow the same odd-column pattern as other examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies B from top-left; simple and reliable.)

```python
def find_frames(g: List[List[int]], B: int) -> List[tuple]:
    # Searches for 11-wide frames of height 4 or 5 with border C and inner all B.
    # Returns list of (C, start_row, start_col, height) for detected frames.
    # Helpful for isolating frames; works well in all examples (detects correctly, as placements happen in right locations).
    # Subtlety: Skips if top-left of potential frame is B; assumes no partial frames.
```
(This function is solid and detects frames accurately based on the rigid structure; key to the puzzle.)

```python
def process_smalls(g: List[List[int]], B: int, out: List[List[int]], frames: List[tuple]) -> dict:
    # Finds and removes (sets to B) all small (<=8 size) connected components of non-B colors using DFS/stack and visited grid.
    # Counts components per color in small_count dict (but current special case for size==4 2x2 adding +2 instead of +1 is broken and causes overcounting).
    # is_special logic for 2x2 squares is unhelpful/broken—not needed; treat all small components as +1.
    # Frames param is unused in function but passed; removal happens globally.
    # Helpful overall for removal and counting, but fix the counting to always +1 per component.
```
(This is mostly helpful for component extraction and removal, but the special case makes it incorrect for counting; remove the is_special and always +1 if not special.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: copies grid to out, gets B, finds frames, processes smalls (removes and counts), then places C pixels in frames based on N. Placement logic (rightmost slots via selected_rel = possible_rel[num_pos - to_fill:]) works well; fixed possible_rel=[1,3,5,7] matches most examples.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection via find_frames worked correctly in all cases (placements occur in expected frame locations and heights).
 * Small component removal worked (outers are cleared to B in outputs).
 * Placement positions worked for training 2 (correct overall) and partially for 1/3 (right number of slots from right, e.g., N=1 at col9, N=4 at 3/5/7/9, N=2 expected at 7/9 but code overplaced due to N error).
 * Counting in process_smalls failed for training 1 and 3: overcounted N for color 4 (placed 4 instead of expected 2 in train1; placed 3 instead of 2 in train3), likely due to broken special case for 2x2 size=4 components adding +2 each instead of +1 (e.g., two 2x2 would give N=4 wrong, should be 2).
 * For training 1: Generated extra inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3 positions) but expected only col7/9 (2); all other frames (2 and 8) matched expected positions and counts.
 * For training 3: Generated inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3) but expected col7/9 (2); color 2 had N=0 correctly (no inner); color 1 had inner 1's at col8/10 (possibly a transcription issue or code bug for odd C, but expected matches printed so may be correct, with mismatch elsewhere minor).
 * Training 2 passed fully, indicating core structure (detection, removal, placement from right) works when counts are accurate.
 * The is_special 2x2 logic is broken/unhelpful (leads to overcount; remove it to fix N).
 * No issues with background detection or grid copying.
 * Potential transcription error in training 3 color1 positions (col8/10 even cols vs. code's odd cols 7/9), but since expected matches printed generated, it may indicate need for parity-based rel (odd C use [2,4,6,8] for even cols 4/6/8/10, rightmost N); however, test uses odd cols for odd C=1/3, so likely always [1,3,5,7] and ex3 print is erroneous.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and consistent with the pattern: removes smalls (assumed), places rightmost N slots in odd inner columns (3,5,7,9) for all frames—e.g., for color 2 (even): 3 placements at col5/7/9 (rightmost 3); color 4 (even): 4 at 3/5/7/9; color 3 (odd): 1 at col9; color 1 (odd): 1 at col9. All in middle rows, frames intact, background 8 preserved.
 * It makes sense as an application of the rules (N=3 for 2, N=4 for 4, N=1 for 3 and 1), but without expected, can't confirm exact counts; positions match the core principle (rightmost every-other from left inner, odd cols). If ex3's even-col placement for odd C=1 is real, test's odd-col for odd C=1/3 doesn't match and would be incorrect—but likely ex3 print error, and test is correct.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the goal is to detect and render specific "structure" patterns (resembling tables or frames with top/bottom bars and side legs) made of consecutive colored cells against a background, then output a cleaned or completed version of the grid by drawing these structures explicitly, including color-specific crossbars in the middle of the leg sections. The structures must have exactly 11 consecutive cells for top/bottom bars, at least 2 "thin" leg rows (only endpoints colored, middle background), and the program processes from top to bottom, marking visited rows to avoid overlap.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures are defined by a top full bar of exactly length 11 (no longer/shorter runs detected, as find_bars skips to look for exactly 11), followed by consecutive thin rows (is_thin checks only endpoints are color c, all between are background), followed immediately by a bottom full bar of 11; if fewer than 2 thin rows or no bottom bar, no structure is drawn.
 * Background is always the top-left cell value (get_background), assumed uniform; output initializes to all background.
 * Processing is top-down (s increments, skipping visited), and only the first valid bar per starting row is drawn (drew=True breaks after one), potentially missing multiple structures per row if they exist.
 * Crossbar is added only in the computed mid_row of thin_rows (s + 1 + num_thin//2, which may not be perfectly centered for even num_thin), placed every other column starting from the right edge (r), for exactly k positions where k depends on color c via get_k: special cases for c=1 (4 - l, l=left index, assumes l=1 for k=3) and c=2 (1 if starting row s==1 else 2, oddly dependent on absolute row position); for c>=3, k = c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3, 3 for c=4).
 * Legs are only drawn at the exact input thin_rows positions (not filled vertically between top/bottom), preserving input sparsity; crossbar may overwrite leg pixels (e.g., rightmost always hits r) or add new colored cells in what was background in thin rows.
 * Visited marks all rows from s to bottom_rr inclusive, preventing re-detection of overlapping or adjacent structures.
 * Subtle: find_bars ignores runs shorter/longer than 11 and skips background; i < w-10 ensures room for 11-cell run; no handling for non-consecutive thin rows (must be immediate sequence) or structures not starting with full bar in non-visited row.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar placement is right-aligned and spaced by 2 (pos -=2), creating dotted effect (e.g., columns 11,9,7 for k=3, r=11); for c=2 in first structure (s==1), minimal k=1 limits to right edge only; no vertical filling of legs, so output legs match input positions exactly; multiple structures are stacked vertically with background separators, but bottom rows remain all-background.
 * Considerations across attempts: Detection works for isolated vertical stacks but may fail if structures overlap horizontally/vertically or have varying leg counts; crossbar logic seems ad-hoc and position-dependent, potentially wrong for non-standard l or s; no error handling for empty/malformed grids; assumes all bars start at same column (e.g., col 1-11), as seen in test.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; essential for distinguishing structures.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        c = row[i]
        j = i
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans row for exactly 11-consecutive non-bg runs, returning start, end (0-indexed), color; core for detecting top bars, ignores shorter/longer.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[j] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks if exact range l to r is entirely color c; used for top/bottom bars.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for j in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[j] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Verifies thin leg row: endpoints c, all interior bg; key for identifying leg sections without middle fills.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, thin_rows: List[int], bottom_rr: int) -> None:
    # Draw top
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s][j] = c
    # Draw bottom
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        output[bottom_rr][j] = c
    # Draw legs
    for tr in thin_rows:
        output[tr][l] = c
        output[tr][r] = c
    # Draw crossbar
    num_thin = len(thin_rows)
    mid_row = s + 1 + (num_thin // 2)
    k = get_k(c, l, s)
    pos = r
    count = 0
    while count < k and pos >= l:
        output[mid_row][pos] = c
        pos -= 2
        count += 1
```
(Renders the detected structure: top/bottom full, legs at input thin positions, crossbar in computed middle row with k right-aligned every-2-columns segments; central to output generation.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; helpful but likely flawed—special cases for low c, position-dependent for c=2; may need generalization for varying l/s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only submission shown; detection of structures (top bar, consecutive thin legs >=2, bottom bar) worked perfectly for all 3 training examples, producing correct outputs.
 * Drawing top/bottom full and legs at exact thin positions worked in training, but crossbar addition (via get_k and right-aligned placement) may be over-specific or incorrect, as it depends on absolute s (row index) for c=2 and assumes fixed l=1.
 * Visited marking prevented overlaps successfully in training, but could miss horizontal multiples (only draws first bar per starting row).
 * find_bars, is_full, is_thin are essential and correct for extraction; draw_structure is core but crossbar logic (every-2 spacing from right) might be unnecessary or wrong if expected is full crossbar or no crossbar.
 * get_k is helpful for color-specific patterns but broken/not general (e.g., c=2 ties to s==1, which works for training's first structure but fails if c=2 appears later; untested for c>4 or l!=1).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the while loop in main only increments s by 1 even after drawing (though skips visited), which is inefficient but worked; no extraction of full objects beyond bars—could add a function to bundle entire structure data (e.g., height, leg count) for better validation.
 * Training 1-3 all correct, implying core detection/rendering matches expected for simple cases (likely single structures with 3 thin rows, standard colors 1-3, l=1).
 * No known mismatches in training, but subtle: if training had no crossbars needed or minimal k, it passed; potential issue if training avoided c=4 or varying s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output rendered four stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23, 0-indexed) separated by all-background rows, with remaining bottom rows all-background (27 rows total); each has full top/bottom bars cols 1-11, legs at cols 1/11 in 3 thin rows each, and color-specific crossbars in middle thin row (row 3 for 2: col 11 only; row 9 for 4: cols 7,9,11; row 15 for 3: cols 9,11; row 21 for 1: cols 7,9,11).
 * Observed effects: Crossbars add extra c cells in middle thin row (e.g., for 4, row 9 has c at 1(leg),7,9,11(leg+overlap), turning a thin row into partial fill; similar dotted right-aligned for others); legs match presumed input thin positions (3 per structure), not vertically filled; no overlaps or misses, all structures detected/drawn.
 * Differences from expected: Without the actual test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but the output does not look fully correct—crossbars create uneven, dotted patterns (e.g., 4's row 9 has isolated 4's at 7/9, resembling incomplete digit but overwriting thin intent; spacing every-2 from right feels arbitrary and may not match puzzle rules for "completion"); if expected is full rectangles or vertical leg fills, this partially matches (bars/legs) but adds unrequested dotted crossbars; if no crossbars needed, this over-draws; looks like digit attempts (2/4/3/1) but 4 appears malformed (right-heavy dots vs. standard left-vertical + full cross); bottom empty rows preserved, which is fine but unprocessed. Overall, detection worked (4 structures found), but rendering (esp. crossbars) likely incorrect, as patterns don't form clean shapes and depend on fragile get_k/s assumptions.
 * The test output makes partial sense (captures structures cleanly except crossbars) but not fully correct—crossbar additions alter thin rows unexpectedly, and right-aligned every-2 may be a misinterpretation (e.g., perhaps crossbars should be full, left-aligned, or absent; or k based on num_thin instead of c/s/l); accounts for multiple stacked but assumes fixed width/positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (8) and incomplete table-like structures in different colors (1, 2, 3, 4), where each structure consists of a top horizontal bar of 11 consecutive cells, at least 3 vertical legs (pairs of colored cells at the ends with background in between), an optional bottom bar, and a crossbar that needs to be completed in the middle leg row. The program's task is to detect these structures in the input grid and output a new grid with the structures fully drawn, including adding the color-specific crossbar segments on the right side of the middle leg, while filling the rest with background and avoiding overlaps via a visited mechanism.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must start with exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c != background in a row, checked via is_full; shorter or longer bars are ignored.
 * Legs are detected downward from the top bar, requiring exactly two c cells at positions l and l+10 with all background (bg) strictly between (l+1 to l+9); if any non-bg appears between, it's not a valid leg (this ensures input legs are "clean" without premature crossbars).
 * At least 3 consecutive valid legs are required to process a structure; fewer are skipped.
 * Bottom bar is preferably detected as a full 11-cell bar exactly one row below the last leg (s + num_leg + 1); if not present or out of bounds, default to s + 4 (though not used in this test).
 * Crossbar is always drawn in the middle leg row (s + 1 + (num_leg // 2)), starting with the leg endpoints (l and l+10), then adding k-1 additional cells inward from the right endpoint at even steps (l+10 - 2*p for p=0 to k-1), creating a right-aligned "cross" pattern (e.g., for k=3: cells at l+10, l+8, l+6; left leg at l remains isolated).
 * Crossbar width k is color- and position-dependent via get_k: c=1 uses 4 - l (e.g., 3 for l=1, adding cells at positions 11,9,7 relative to l=1); c=2 uses 1 if starting row s==1 (minimal, no extras) else 2; c>=3 uses c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3 adding at 11,9; 3 for c=4 adding at 11,9,7).
 * All drawing overwrites to c only for top/bottom (full 11 cells), legs (just endpoints), and crossbar (endpoints + extras); the output grid starts as all bg, so it reconstructs structures without copying extraneous input cells.
 * Process rows from top to bottom (s loop), skipping visited rows to prevent reprocessing overlaps; marks all rows from top to bottom (inclusive) as visited after drawing.
 * Subtlety: get_k's special case for c=2 depending on s==1 assumes position-specific rules (e.g., topmost structure gets minimal cross); this works for training but may fail if 2 appears elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: Structures are exactly 11 cells wide (l to l+10), starting at various l but fixed width; no rotation, vertical, or irregular shapes.
 * Subtlety: Input may have "clean" legs (bg between) but the program adds the crossbar, implying the puzzle is to complete/infer the cross; if input already has cross-like non-bg between legs, detection fails (is_leg returns False), skipping the structure.
 * All structures in test start at l=1, but code handles general l; background uniform from g[0][0].
 * No handling for isolated bars, fewer than 3 legs, or non-horizontal elements; assumes no overlapping structures (visited prevents but may miss interleaved ones).
 * Grid size: n rows, m=23 columns in test; l < m-10 to fit 11 cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color, essential for distinguishing structures and checking legs.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    return all(row[k] == c for k in range(l, l + 10))  # Note: range(l, l+11) would be correct for 11 cells; current is l to l+9 (10 cells)—potential off-by-one bug, but works if input matches.
```
(Checks for full horizontal bar of exactly 11 cells; critical for tops/bottoms; subtle off-by-one in range may cause issues for edge cases.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, bg: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[l + 10] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, l + 10):  # Checks l+1 to l+9 (9 cells); assumes input has bg here for valid leg.
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Key for detecting clean legs; strict bg requirement between endpoints ensures no premature crossbars in input.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar width; essential for color-specific completion; s-dependency for c=2 is position-aware but brittle if 2 moves.)

The main program function integrates these to detect, count legs, draw components, and mark visited rows; no types like classes needed, but could add a Structure dataclass for top/l/legs/bottom/k if refactoring.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it successfully passed all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection of full bars, legs, and crossbar drawing works for those cases.
 * Likely handled training structures with clean legs and position-specific k values (e.g., c=2 at s=1 getting k=1).
 * Potential missed subtlety: range in is_full is to l+10 (10 cells), but 11 needed (should be l+11); may coincidentally work if inputs align but risks missing 1-cell shorts.
 * get_k's s==1 for c=2 assumes fixed positioning; if training had 2 only at top, it passed, but generalizes poorly.
 * Visited marking from s to bottom inclusive prevents overlaps effectively in vertical stacking (as in test).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_full, is_leg, get_k) are relevant and core to detection/drawing—no broken ones noted, though is_full range is subtly imprecise.
 * No extraction of full objects attempted; code processes inline without storing structures, which works but could miss if needing to validate post-draw.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct based on puzzle rules: it reconstructs 4 stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23) with tops/bottoms as full 11-cell bars (cols 1-11), legs as endpoints only (cols 1 and 11), and crossbars added only in middle leg rows with color-specific widths—no extras for c=2 (k=1, row 3: just cols 1/11), one extra for c=3 (k=2, row 15: cols 1/9/11), two extras for c=4 and c=1 (k=3, rows 9/21: cols 1/7/9/11), all on bg elsewhere with no overlaps.
 * Expected: Input likely had clean outlines (full tops/bottoms, legs with bg between, no crossbars), and program completed crosses correctly without copying input extras; output isolates right-aligned cross patterns (e.g., no full horizontal cross, just stepped right-side fills + left leg).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Crossbars are not symmetric/full (e.g., gap between left leg at col 1 and right cross starting at col 7/9/11); this matches code but may be a subtlety— if puzzle expects connected/full bars, it's incorrect (unknown without true output, but consistent with training success).
 * For c=2, no change beyond legs (correct per k=1 and s=1); for others, added cells (e.g., row 9 cols 7/9 filled from bg to 4) complete the pattern without over-drawing.
 * All rows between structures (e.g., 0/6/12/18/24-26) are pure bg (8), and post-23 rows untouched; no artifacts or skips.
 * Overall, output demonstrates understanding: detects all 4 structures (num_leg=3 each), draws precisely, handles varying k; looks correct assuming puzzle goal is right-aligned cross completion.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are **obviously consistent across EVERY example**. These are limited to direct, observable relationships between elements (e.g., color propagation, property transformations like holes/pixels, positional containment) that appear in all cases without variation or inconsistency. Only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., scattered small input elements without output effects, background input properties) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., exact determination of *how many* 1-pixel elements to add, or precise positioning logic within the inner shape) are noted as such rather than speculated.

#### 1. **Outer Frame Color → Added 1-Pixel Element Color (Per Frame Level)**
   - **Description**: The color of each outer frame (the large holes=1, pixels=28 shape at each vertical level: top/middle/bottom) directly determines the color of small 1-pixel (pixels=1, holes=0) elements added inside its corresponding inner shape.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color propagation (outer affects inner contents).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top outer Yellow → added Yellow 1px elements (2 total); Middle outer Maroon → added Maroon 1px (4 total); Bottom outer Red → added Red 1px (1 total).
     - Train 2: Top outer Blue → added Blue 1px (1 total); Middle outer Pink → added Pink 1px (3 total); Bottom outer Yellow → added Yellow 1px (2 total).
     - Train 3: Top outer Red → added Red 1px (0 total, i.e., no addition); Middle outer Yellow → added Yellow 1px (2 total); Bottom outer Blue → added Blue 1px (2 total).
   - **Positional Connection**: Added elements are always contained within the bbox of their paired inner shape (e.g., top inner bbox y-range includes added y-positions in all cases).
   - **Unknown**: Logic for exact number of 1px elements (varies: 0-4; possibly influenced by input small elements like pixel counts or positions, but not consistently explainable).

#### 2. **Number of Added 1-Pixel Elements → Inner Shape Holes Increase**
   - **Description**: The number (N) of 1-pixel elements added inside an inner shape (the large holes=0, pixels=27 filled shape at each level) causes the inner shape's holes property to increase by exactly N.
   - **Interaction Type**: Count-based transformation (added elements create "holes" in inner).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top inner holes 0 → 2 (N=2); Middle 0 → 4 (N=4); Bottom 0 → 1 (N=1).
     - Train 2: Top inner holes 0 → 1 (N=1); Middle 0 → 3 (N=3); Bottom 0 → 2 (N=2).
     - Train 3: Top inner holes 0 → 0 (N=0); Middle 0 → 2 (N=2); Bottom 0 → 2 (N=2).
   - **Positional Connection**: Transformation only affects the inner shape containing the added elements (no cross-level effects observed consistently).
   - **Note**: Applies even when N=0 (no change).

#### 3. **Number of Added 1-Pixel Elements → Inner Shape Pixels Decrease**
   - **Description**: The number (N) of 1-pixel elements added inside an inner shape causes the inner shape's pixels property to decrease by exactly N (from baseline ~27).
   - **Interaction Type**: Count-based transformation (added elements "remove" pixels from inner, possibly representing subtraction or overwriting).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top inner pixels 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2); Middle 27 → 23 (Δ=-4, N=4); Bottom 27 → 26 (Δ=-1, N=1).
     - Train 2: Top inner 27 → 26 (Δ=-1, N=1); Middle 27 → 24 (Δ=-3, N=3); Bottom 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2).
     - Train 3: Top inner 27 → 27 (Δ=0, N=0); Middle 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2); Bottom 27 → 25 (Δ=-2, N=2).
   - **Positional Connection**: Tied to containment within the inner shape's bbox (added elements' positions are internal, e.g., x-coordinates like 7/9 or 6/8/10 align within inner x-range).
   - **Note**: Applies even when N=0 (no change). Outer frames' pixels/holes remain unchanged (28/1) in all cases.

#### 4. **Top-Level Inner Shape Color → Output Background Color**
   - **Description**: The color of the top-level inner shape (uppermost holes=0/~27 element) directly sets the color of the output background (the large enclosing shape with high holes and pixels, bbox ~[0,0,22,*]).
   - **Interaction Type**: Color propagation (top inner overrides/dominates background).
   - **Consistency**:
     - Train 1: Top inner Blue → output background Blue.
     - Train 2: Top inner Maroon → output background Maroon.
     - Train 3: Top inner Green → output background Green.
   - **Property Connection**: Background holes consistently set to 3 in output (from varying input values: 12→3, 11→3, 8→3), but pixel increase varies (+28, +27, +30) and is unknown (not tied to a clear consistent count).
   - **Positional Connection**: Background encloses all frames; no effect on inner/outer properties.
   - **Unknown**: Exact pixel change logic for background (increases but not by fixed amount or clear input link).

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No Cross-Level Interactions**: No consistent effects between frames (e.g., middle never affects top/bottom properties across all trains).
- **Input Small Elements**: Scattered small shapes (e.g., pixels=2-8, various colors/positions outside frames) disappear in outputs and may influence N (e.g., their pixel counts or positions correlating with added 1px numbers), but this is not consistently explainable (e.g., Train 1 has multiple small Yellow/Green/Maroon, but only specific counts added; varies per train).
- **Irrelevant Elements Excluded**: Background input properties (beyond color override), outer frame stability, and non-frame small elements show no consistent output interactions. Symbols/L-shapes mentioned in high-level description do not map to consistent data properties (e.g., no uniform "cross" or "×" via pixels/holes/bbox across trains).
- **No Transformations Explained Beyond These**: Bbox shifts (e.g., Train 2 uses [2,2,12,6] vs. [1,1,11,5]) or exact 1px positions (e.g., y often mid-inner row, x centered but varies) are not consistently tied to inputs; called unknown. No movement/color changes for outers or non-added elements.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 05:51:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids that contain incomplete "frame" or "window" structures outlined in a specific color c against a background, where the task is to detect these structures and complete them by rendering a pixel pattern inside the middle section that visually represents the digit corresponding to the color value c (e.g., drawing a "4" inside a frame of color 4), using c-colored pixels on the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are defined by: a top horizontal bar of exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c starting at column L in row s; a matching bottom bar in row s+4; vertical sides of c at columns L and R=L+10 in the three middle rows (s+1 to s+3), with background everywhere else in the middle section.
 * The output completes the frame by ensuring full top/bottom bars of c from L to R, full vertical sides of c in all middle rows at L and R, and crucially, adding a specific pattern of c pixels in ONE of the middle rows (usually s+2 as the "center," but sometimes s+3 for certain digits like 2) to render the digit c in a blocky, 1-row-high font style—positions are chosen to form the shape of the digit (e.g., alternating for 8, crossbar for 4, right-aligned for 1, bottom curve for 2/3).
 * Background color bg is typically the top-left cell (e.g., 1 or 8); output initializes to all bg and overlays the completed frames without overlapping or modifying outside areas.
 * Subtle: The pattern row and positions vary by digit c—not a simple formula like kk=c//2 inners from right on parity positions, but digit-specific (e.g., for c=8, dense alternating odds/evens filling most of center row; for c=4, sparse with crossbar around center-right; for c=2, pattern shifted to s+3 row with right-bottom emphasis; for c=1, right-aligned vertical with 2-3 points near R; for c=3, similar to 2 but with middle hook). Low c (1,2,3) often cluster pixels near the right side and may use non-center rows.
 * Detection scans each row s for runs of exactly length=11 non-bg, checks s+4 uniform c over [L,R+1], and verifies middle rows have only sides c at L/R with bg in between—no partial or overlapping frames assumed.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns are only in one middle row per frame (not all three); for even/odd L, parity affects position choice (e.g., evens for even L); special handling for c=1/2 (not fitting integer division); output must preserve original bg elsewhere; frames are 5 rows high, 11 cols wide, separated by empty rows.
 * Considerations across attempts: Overlays can accumulate if multiple detections, but examples show non-overlapping; test inputs have multiple frames stacked vertically with bg=8 and low c (1,2,3,4), requiring digit-specific rendering; incorrect pattern positions lead to wrong shapes (e.g., treating c=1 like c=4); row for pattern must be adjustable (s+2 default, but s+3 for c=2); no filling of top/bottom/sides if already present, but code reinitializes and sets them fully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This correctly extracts bg from top-left; useful for init and checks.)

```python
def is_uniform(row: List[int], start: int, length: int, color: int) -> bool:
    return all(row[j] == color for j in range(start, start + length))
```
(This verifies uniform bars/sides; essential for detection, works well in all attempts.)

(The frame detection loop in the program is helpful: scans for length=11 runs, checks s+4 uniform, verifies middle rows have only L/R as c with bg inside; collects frames as (s, L, R, c). This core logic succeeds for train3 and parts of 1/2.)

(No types defined; a Frame tuple (s: int, L: int, R: int, c: int) could help organize.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly detects frames via run-length scanning and uniform checks, successfully completing basic structure (top/bottom full bars, all middle sides) for all training examples where patterns match the flawed logic (e.g., train3 correct, likely had fitting c like 4/6/8).
 * What worked: Frame detection and basic filling (top s row L to R=c, bottom s+4 L to R=c, all middle rows L and R=c); pattern logic works for mid-high c (4,6,8) using reverse-sorted parity positions with kk=c//2, producing correct digit shapes like alternating for 8 (every odd/even), crossbar for 4 (positions ~7,9 + sides).
 * What didn't work: Pattern selection flawed for low c—uses special if c==1 (kk=2, p=1) or c==2 (kk=0, no inners), leading to incorrect/missing pixels; for c=1 in train2, sets inners at 9,11 but expected ~10,12 (right-clustered for digit 1, with bg at 11); for c=2 in train1, kk=0 skips inners entirely (generated sides-only in s+2), but expected has inners at 9,11 in s+3 row (bottom bar for digit 2); also minor bug in set_right logic (checks pattern_pos[0]==R-1 but for odds may mismatch evens); reinitializes out to bg and overlays, but doesn't preserve potential input pixels outside patterns.
 * Train1 incorrect: 4's and 8's match expected (correct digit shapes in s+2), but 2's has no inners in s+2 (generated all middle rows sides-only), while expected has pattern in s+3 row16 (positions 1,9,11=2 for digit 2 shape); unknown why only s+3 for 2, but it's different from default s+2.
 * Train2 incorrect: 6's and 4's match expected (even L=2, evens 6,8,10 + sides for 6; 8,10 + sides for 4, forming digits), but 1's center row4=s+2 has wrong positions (generated 2=1,9=1,11=1,12=1? but list shows extra/misplaced like col11=1 instead of bg, col9=1 too left), expected 2=1,10=1,12=1 with 11=8 bg (right-aligned for digit 1, clustered near R without filling 11); also generated has anomalous 1 at col12=1 but extra 1's misaligned.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had c values (e.g., 4/6/8) where the parity/kk logic fits digit shapes perfectly in s+2, no low-c specials needed.
 * The inner pattern code (if c==1/2 special, else p=L%2, kk=c//2, inner_pos=parity j in (L+1,R), reverse sort, take[:kk], set in center=s+2) is partially helpful for mid-high c but broken for low c (wrong kk/p, fixed row); don't use specials as-is—replace with digit-specific maps (e.g., dict of c to (pattern_row_offset, list of relative positions)).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_uniform) are relevant, though the full filling loop has bugs in low-c handling and set_right (sometimes over/under-sets R).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—it completes basic frames (top/bottom full, middle sides) for all (c=2 rows1-5, c=4 rows7-11, c=3 rows13-17, c=1 rows19-23) with bg=8, and patterns in s+2 for each, but uses flawed logic leading to wrong digit shapes for low c.
 * For c=2 (rows1-5, L=1,R=11): Only sides in center row3 (no inners, due to kk=0 special), but likely incorrect—based on train1, digit 2 needs inners at ~9,11 in s+3=row4 (bottom-right bar); current sides-only doesn't form a recognizable 2.
 * For c=4 (rows7-11, L=1,R=11): Center row9 has 1=4,7=4,9=4,11=4 (kk=2 odds reverse 9,7 + sides), which matches train1 4's and looks like digit 4 (crossbar right); this seems correct.
 * For c=3 (rows13-17, L=1,R=11): Center row15 has 1=3,9=3,11=3 (similar to c=4 but only 2 inners? Wait, code for c=3: p=1%2=1, kk=3//2=1, odds reverse take1:9, + sides 1,11), forming partial right cluster; may be ok for digit 3 (middle/bottom hook), but train2 suggests low c need right-clustering without left inners—looks plausible but unverified, potentially missing a pixel at ~7 or using wrong row.
 * For c=1 (rows19-23, L=1,R=11): Center row21 has 1=1,7=1,9=1,11=1 (code special kk=2 p=1 odds reverse 11,9 but sets 7? Wait, reverse 11,9,7,5,3 take2:11,9 + sides1,11; but list shows extra at7? Mismatch in generated list [8,1,8...7=1,8=8,9=1,10=8,11=1,12=8], actually 1,7,9,11—looks like c=4 shape, not digit 1; incorrect, should be right-clustered like train2 (e.g., ~8-11 with some bg, only 2-3 points near R) to form slim vertical 1.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (basic frames good, high-c like4 ok), but low-c (1,2,3) patterns don't form proper digits (too many/left-shifted inners or missing/shifted rows), failing to handle specials/subtleties; to fix, use digit-specific patterns (e.g., for c=1: offset=2, positions [0,8,10] relative to L; for c=2: offset=3, positions [0,8,10]) and test on train1/2 mismatches.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 05:51:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 06:06:14] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns that resemble letter-like structures (e.g., H-shapes or similar bar-connected forms) made of colored pixels, where the task is to detect thick horizontal bars with thin vertical supports and complete missing crossbars or connections in the middle rows based on color-specific rules, while preserving the background and removing noise. The program modifies the input grid in-place to fill these completions, then cleans up small artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns consist of 5-row high structures: full thick bars (same color) at top (row i) and bottom (row i+4), thin vertical lines (only edges non-bg, middle bg) in rows i+1 to i+3, spanning a fixed width (e.g., 11 columns from L to R).
 * Completions occur only in the exact middle row (i+2) of the pattern, placing color pixels at specific relative positions (e.g., for color 4, potentially at offsets like 6 and 8 from L, but logic must account for nearby structures to avoid overfilling).
 * Color-specific rules for filling: Different colors trigger different fill patterns (e.g., c=4 may fill two positions if no adjacent interference, c=1/3/5 fill varying numbers of positions in the second block); must check for "has_middle" (non-bg/non-c in middle row after R) and "has_other" (similar in adjacent rows) to decide fills.
 * Background (bg) is the most common color; small connected components (<7 pixels, 8-connected) of non-bg should be erased to bg after filling to remove noise.
 * Subtlety: Fills must not overwrite existing non-bg; patterns may overlap or be adjacent (e.g., in example 3, 1's bar near edge affects fills); hardcoded L/R positions (1-11, 2-12) miss wider/shifted bars or vertical orientations.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x23 in examples), rows vary but patterns are vertically stacked with bg separators; no diagonal connections in component detection.
 * Easy to miss: Thin rows must have exactly bg in interior (L+1 to R-1), but edges at L and R non-bg; fills are conditional on no interference from other colors post-R; remove_small_components uses stack-based flood fill (8 directions, excluding self).
 * All modifications are in a copy of the grid (result); original g unchanged during detection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing patterns and noise removal; works in all examples where bg=1 or 8 or 3.)

```python
def remove_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> None:
    if threshold <= 0:
        return
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                c_comp = g[i][j]
                size = 0
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    size += 1
                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                                continue
                            nx = x + dx
                            ny = y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == c_comp:
                                visited[nx][ny] = True
                                stack.append((nx, ny))
                if size < threshold:
                    for x, y in component:
                        g[x][y] = bg
```
(This performs 8-connected flood fill to erase small same-color components < threshold size; helpful for post-fill cleanup, though threshold=7 may need tuning; correctly identifies components but not used effectively here due to no fills happening.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The fill_bars function is overly hardcoded to specific L/R (1-11 and 2-12), missing patterns in training examples (e.g., example 1 4-bar at cols 1-11 should fill row 3 cols 7,9,11 with 4, but generated has no fills, leaving row 3 as [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,...] vs expected [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,...]; similar for 8-bar row 9 missing fills like cols 3,5,7,9,11 with 8).
 * For color=4 logic in first block, has_middle/has_other checks fail to trigger fills (e.g., in example 1, adjacent 1's bg don't qualify as "other", so no fills; unknown why it doesn't set result[m][7]=4 and [9]=4 as fallback).
 * Second block (L=2,R=12) never triggers in examples (e.g., example 1 has no matching c=1/3/5 patterns there; example 3 1-bar at cols 1-11 doesn't match L=2, so no fills in row 16 cols ~7-9 with 1).
 * In example 2 (bg=8), 1-bar (rows 2-6, cols 2-12) should fill row 4 col 10 with 1 (expected [...,1,8,1,...] at col10), but generated has full thin bg, no fill; similar misses for 6-bar row 10 cols 6,8,10,12? with 6, and 4-bar row 16 cols 8,10,12? with 4.
 * Example 3 (bg=3) generated extra/misplaced 1's in rows 1-5 cols 16-18 (from unknown source, perhaps erroneous detection), and misses fills like row 9 cols 7,9,11 with 4; row 16 cols 7,9 with 1 (expected has 1 at col7 in row15? but generated all thin bg).
 * Overall, no training example passes: generated preserves input but adds no correct fills, leading to incomplete crossbars; small component removal doesn't activate since no new small pieces created.
 * The program function correctly copies grid and applies steps in order (fill then remove), but fill_bars is broken/not general (doesn't scan all possible i/L/R, color rules incomplete).
 * find_background and remove_small_components are helpful and correct but underutilized (no noise in inputs, so removal inert).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8) incorrectly adds stray 2's (e.g., row 5 col 18=2, outside main 2-bar cols 1-11; row 6 cols 16-20=2, creating unintended horizontal bar not in input) and preserves incomplete thin rows without fills (e.g., 2-bar rows 2-4 all bg interiors, no crossbar in row 3; similar for 4-bar row 9 no fills, 3-bar row 15 no fills, 1-bar row 21 no fills).
 * It does not look correct: Expected should complete crossbars similarly to training (e.g., for 2-bar rows1-5 cols1-11, fill row3 with 2's at specific positions like cols 5,7,9 based on color rules; but generated has no such fills, and extra 2's suggest buggy detection/overreach beyond hardcoded L/R).
 * Misses pattern at bottom (1-bar rows19-23 cols1-11 likely needs fills in row21 cols ~5,7,9 with 1, but none present); the stray fills (e.g., row6 2's) indicate the hardcoded blocks are firing incorrectly on non-matching patterns, breaking the grid.
 * To handle test, need general pattern scanning (all possible L/R widths, all colors) and interference checks (e.g., nearby 2's in row6 col18 shouldn't trigger extraneous fills).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 06:06:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 06:18:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with incomplete 5-row-high block (or "frame") structures of specific colors against a uniform background, where the goal is to detect these blocks and complete them by solidifying the top and bottom bars, adding vertical side walls, filling the interior with background color, and inserting a characteristic pattern of isolated color pixels in the central inner row (offset +2 from the block start), while potentially removing small noise components elsewhere in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks are always exactly 5 rows high (searched via starts at i and ends at i+4), with widths based on long consecutive runs (>=10 cells) of the same non-background color in the top and bottom rows; the left/right edges are determined by min/max of the run positions across top/bottom.
 * Detection requires matching color c between top/bottom runs, with the bottom run being fully solid (no gaps of bg inside the run), and complete vertical side walls already present in the input grid at the edge columns for all 3 inner rows— this is a subtlety that's easy to miss, as it assumes partial completeness in input (sides present but top/bottom possibly gappy), but may fail for more incomplete inputs.
 * Completion fills top/bottom fully solid with c across the block width, sets sides to c in inner rows (overwriting if needed), fills all inner columns (between sides) with bg in all inner rows, then adds pattern only in the middle inner row (start_r + 2).
 * The pattern is a set of isolated c pixels placed every 2 columns inward from the right edge (col = right - 2*ii for ii=1 to k), not connected to sides or each other (separated by bg), forming "protrusions" or "teeth" from the right wall; k appears tied to c (roughly floor(c/2) or similar, capped ~4), but inconsistent across examples—e.g., c=1 has k=1 in train2 but k=2 in train3; c=2 has k=1 in train1 but k=0 (no pattern) in train3; c=4 consistently k=2; c=6 k=3; c=8 k=4 (full every-other-column alternating across the width). This variability suggests k may depend on c combined with block width/position or input hints, not purely c; easy to miss that for small c (1-2), patterns can be absent or minimal, and positions shift if left/right vary (e.g., 1-11 vs. 2-12).
 * Background is always from top-left corner (g[0][0]), uniform, and non-block areas remain unchanged except for potential cleaning.
 * After completion, small connected components (<10 cells) of any non-bg color are flood-filled and set to bg; this removes noise but crucially also erases the isolated pattern pixels (each size 1, not adjacent), which must be preserved in expected outputs—subtle bug: cleaning should be restricted (e.g., only outside blocks, or only for non-block colors, or min_size=1 for block interiors) to avoid this.
 * Blocks don't overlap and are separated by bg rows; multiple blocks per grid, independent.
 * Input incompleteness: Tops/bottoms may have gaps (code fills them if detected), but sides must be fully present for detection (has_side_walls checks input g, not output); if sides missing, block skipped entirely.
 * Widths are ~11 cells (run >=10), but exact left/right can shift (e.g., col 1-11 or 2-12), affecting pattern cols; pattern never touches left side, always biased to right.
 * No patterns in non-middle inner rows; all inner rows except middle are pure bg between sides.
 * Potential noise: Small non-block blobs in input may need cleaning, but block patterns (even small) must stay.
 * Edge cases: For c=1/2, patterns optional/absent in some blocks (e.g., train3 c=2 has none); k max 4 even for large c; patterns are single pixels, not bars, so connectivity is zero beyond isolation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful building blocks for detection and completion, though buggy in pattern logic and cleaning.

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color from the top-left corner."""
    return g[0][0]
```
(This is solid and correctly identifies bg=1,8,3 across examples.)

```python
def find_long_run(row: List[int], bg: int, min_len: int = 10) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """Find the first long run of non-background color in the row."""
    # (Implementation as provided; helpful for locating potential block edges via first >=10 run of same non-bg.)
    # Returns (color, left_idx, right_idx) or (None, None, None).
```
(This works well for spotting top/bottom runs; subtle: assumes first run only, ignores multiples in row.)

```python
def is_solid_run(row: List[int], bg: int, L: int, R: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Check if the segment from L to R in row is solidly color c."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for verifying bottom row solidity in input.)
```
(Helpful for strict bottom check, but could be relaxed for incomplete inputs.)

```python
def has_side_walls(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, L: int, R: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Check if all inner rows have color c at columns L and R."""
    # (Implementation as provided; checks input g for full sides, key for detection but brittle if input incomplete.)
```
(Useful but limiting; suggestion: modify to check partial sides or fill regardless if top/bottom match.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    """Find all 5-row block structures based on solid top/bottom and side walls."""
    # (Implementation as provided; core detection logic, returns list of (start_r, end_r, left, right, c).)
```
(Helpful overall, but fails if sides incomplete; integrates above functions well.)

```python
def complete_block(out: List[List[int]], bg: int, block: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]):
    """Complete a detected block: fill top/bottom solid, sides in inner rows, and middle pattern."""
    # (Implementation as provided, but pattern k = min(4, c // 2) is approximate/wrong for some cases; adds isolated pixels.)
```
(Helpful structure, but broken pattern calc (e.g., k=0 for c=1 misses expected k=1/2); fills bg inner correctly.)

```python
def clean_small_components(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 10):
    """Flood fill and remove small connected components of non-background colors."""
    # (Implementation as provided; uses 4-dir connectivity, cleans any non-bg < min_size in out.)
```
(Helpful for noise removal, but broken/not helpful as-is because it erases intended isolated pattern pixels (size 1); don't use without mods like skipping block interiors or block colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) demonstrates partial understanding by correctly detecting blocks when sides are present in input, filling top/bottom solid with c, adding sides in inner rows, and filling inner areas with bg, which matches the structural completion in all generated outputs.
 * What worked: Background detection always correct; long-run finding identifies block edges accurately; for cases where blocks are detected (sides present), the frame (top/bottom/sides) is completed properly, and out grid is copied from input initially to preserve non-block areas.
 * What didn't work: Pattern addition uses incorrect/arbitrary k = min(4, c//2), leading to mismatches—e.g., train1 c=2 (k=1 expected, code k=1 but cleaned away); train2 c=1 (k=1 expected, code k=0 no add); train3 c=1 (k=2 expected, code k=0 no add); train3 c=2 (k=0 expected, code k=1 would add but cleaned). Even when added, patterns are always erased by cleaning due to isolation (size 1 components <10), resulting in all inner rows being pure bg except sides in generated vs. expected (e.g., train1 row3 missing 4's at cols 7/9; train2 row4 missing 1 at col 10; train3 row15 missing 1's at 7/9).
 * Detection brittle: Relies on input having full sides (has_side_walls on g), skipping incomplete blocks; but generated shows completion happened, implying inputs had sides but gappy top/bottom.
 * Cleaning function is conceptually helpful for noise but practically broken for this puzzle, as it removes essential small pattern components uniformly (no distinction for block interiors/colors); unhelpful without fixes—avoid using as-is.
 * For train1: Generated fills frames correctly but inner rows all bg except sides (no pattern in row3/9/15); differs from expected by missing isolated c pixels in middle row (e.g., row3 lacks 4 at 7/9; row9 lacks 8 at 3/5/7/9; row15 lacks 2 at 9)—effect: blank interiors instead of patterned.
 * For train2: Similar frame completion, but row4 lacks 1 at 10; row10 lacks 6 at 6/8/10; row16 lacks 4 at 8/10 (plus misaligned sides at col2/12 vs. expected); differs by missing right-biased patterns and some inner 1's/6's/4's in middle rows—effect: over-filled bg in patterns, partial mismatch in row4/10/16 positions.
 * For train3: Frames filled, but row9 lacks 4 at 7/9; row15 lacks 1 at 7/9; row3/4/15 have no pattern where expected (or none for c=2); differs by missing patterns in middle rows for c=4/1 blocks, and correctly absent for c=2 but code would wrongly add if not cleaned—effect: blank for patterned blocks, unknown if c=2 absence is intentional or detection failure.
 * No function for extracting/handling incomplete blocks (e.g., predict sides if top/bottom match); pattern logic needs data-driven k (e.g., map c to k from examples).
 * Overall, structural completion works ~70%, but pattern omission via wrong k + cleaning makes all incorrect.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it follows the same pattern as training generated outputs by completing block frames (solid top/bottom with c=2/4/3/1 in rows 1-5/7-11/13-17/19-23, sides at ~col1/11 or similar, inner bg) against bg=8, but lacks any patterns in middle rows (e.g., row3 for c=2 block all bg inner except sides, but expected likely needs k=1 protrusion like train1 c=2 at ~col9; row9 for c=4 likely needs 2 protrusions at ~7/9; row15 for c=3 unknown but likely some; row21 for c=1 likely 1-2 at ~9 or 7/9).
 * Differences: No isolated c pixels in middle rows (all erased by cleaning or not added due to k logic); e.g., bottom c=1 block row21 has only sides, but based on train2/3 c=1, should have 1-2 near-right pixels; top c=2 row3 blank inner, but train1 c=2 had one—effect: sterile frames without the defining color-specific "teeth" patterns, making it incomplete like trainings.
 * To handle test: Update k logic (e.g., k = c // 2 for most, but special case c=1/2); modify cleaning to preserve small c-components inside block bounds (e.g., mark block areas, skip flood-fill there); relax detection for incomplete sides; assume similar width ~11, right-biased patterns.

[2025-10-02 06:18:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with multiple embedded "frame" structures (rectangular borders of consistent color, 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, against a uniform background), where each frame contains a unique inner pattern made of the frame's color on background spaces, and the task appears to be cleaning the grid by preserving the full frame borders and their specific inner patterns while removing extraneous non-background elements (noise) outside the frames to produce a clean output with only the frames and their contents.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames always consist of top and bottom rows that are fully uniform in the frame color (11 consecutive cells != background), with vertical sides only on the three inner rows (leftmost and rightmost cells of the frame color), and the immediate inner spaces on those side rows must be background to confirm a valid empty-border structure.
 * Inner patterns (on the three middle rows, especially the center row) vary per frame and represent specific designs (e.g., sparse dots like two isolated color cells, dense alternating color/background like every other cell, or sparser placements like a single offset dot or clustered fills); these must be preserved exactly, not erased or generically replaced.
 * Background color is always g[0][0], and the grid width is odd (23 columns), affecting positioning; frames are non-overlapping and start at column 1 in examples, but detection must scan generally.
 * Noise removal should only target non-background elements outside detected frames (e.g., small disconnected components or artifacts not part of any frame); blindly erasing all non-marked non-background cells destroys valid inner patterns.
 * Subtlety: Detection assumes inner rows (dr=1 to 3) have all inner cells (j=1 to 9) as background during detection, which works for empty frames but fails if patterns exist in input (as they do); this means detection must happen before patterns are present or use a different approach to identify frames without requiring empty inners.
 * Frames may have borders that blend with adjacent background in some cases (e.g., extra background cells around), but the uniform 11-cell top/bottom is key.
 * Patterns are only on the middle row in many cases (r_start + 2), but side rows may have fills (e.g., in train2, side inners have color fills extending from borders).
 * Easy to miss: Inner patterns can connect to borders in input (e.g., touching sides), so removal logic must avoid flood-fill or connectivity checks that could erase them; also, multiple frames per grid, with varying colors (2,4,8,1,3,6).
 * Overall goal seems to "complete" or clean frames by ensuring borders are solid and inners are as per some rule (possibly Morse-like or binary representation), but examples suggest preserving input patterns while zeroing external noise.
 * Grid height ~23-28 rows, with empty background rows separating frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg and is useful; no issues.)

```python
def is_uniform(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start: int, length: int, color: int) -> bool:
    for j in range(start, start + length):
        if g[r][j] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This is helpful for checking solid border lines; accurate and reusable for top/bottom detection.)

```python
def detect_frames(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    frames = []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows - 4):
        for start in range(cols - 10):
            color = g[r][start]
            if color != bg and is_uniform(g, r, start, 11, color):
                if is_uniform(g, r + 4, start, 11, color):
                    good = True
                    for dr in range(1, 4):
                        rr = r + dr
                        if g[rr][start] != color or g[rr][start + 10] != color:
                            good = False
                            break
                        for j in range(1, 10):
                            if g[rr][start + j] != bg:
                                good = False
                                break
                        if not good:
                            break
                    if good:
                        frames.append((r, start, color))
    return frames
```
(This detects frame positions and colors accurately when inners are empty during check, but breaks on inputs with pre-existing patterns since it requires inner rows to be all bg; partially helpful but needs modification to ignore inner non-bg for detection or detect after masking.)

```python
def mark_borders(g: List[List[int]], frames: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[bool]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    marked = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    for r_start, c_start, _ in frames:
        for j in range(c_start, c_start + 11):
            marked[r_start][j] = True
            marked[r_start + 4][j] = True
        for dr in range(1, 4):
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start] = True
            marked[r_start + dr][c_start + 10] = True
    return marked
```
(This correctly marks only borders; useful for protecting frame outlines during cleanup, but does not mark inner patterns, which is good if we want to preserve them separately.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Detection of frames works partially (e.g., identifies positions and colors for simple cases like train1 first frame), but fails for cases where inner patterns exist during detection (e.g., train2 and train3, where non-bg in middle rows prevents 'good=True').
 * Removal logic (remove_small_components) erases all non-border non-bg cells, including valid inner patterns, leading to empty inners in output; this destroys the puzzle's core (preserving patterns) and is a major flaw.
 * add_dots function adds generic 2 dots per frame in fixed positions (columns ~7 and 9 relative to left inner, on middle row), which coincidentally matches train1 first frame's sparse pattern but fails for dense/alternating patterns (e.g., train1 second frame missing full 1-8-1-8... alternation, only has sparse 8's at ~7,9,11) and sparser ones (e.g., train1 third frame missing the single offset 2 at col9, adds wrong ones at 7 and 9).
 * In train1: First frame correct by coincidence (dots match expected sparse pattern), but second frame incorrect (generated has isolated 8's at col7,9,11 on middle row instead of full alternating 8-1 across col1-11); third frame incorrect (no inner 2's added on middle row, expected single 2 at col9).
 * In train2: Detection likely failed for all frames (tops/bottoms not fully uniform color due to mixed borders/inners, e.g., top row2 has 8 borders + 1 inners, not uniform 1), so no marking/removal/add, output keeps input as-is with noise; differs from expected where inners are cleaned to specific patterns (e.g., middle row4 has 1 at col10 and col12 misplaced? Expected has 1's only at sides and specific inner spots, but generated has extra 1's and wrong 8 placements in sides).
 * In train3: Similar detection issues (e.g., first frame's middle row has inner 2's, failing uniformity check on inners==bg); generated keeps some inners but incorrectly (e.g., third frame middle row has 1's everywhere inner, expected has isolated 1 at col9); second frame middle row generated [3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,4,3,...] has sparse 4's, expected full alternating 4-3-4...).
 * Overall, no training example fully correct; program understands frame structure but mishandles preservation (erases inners, adds wrong generic dots).
 * Function remove_small_components is broken for this puzzle (erases valid content, not just small/external noise; do not use as-is, needs connectivity check or frame-containment logic).
 * Function add_dots is unhelpful/not relevant (assumes generic dots, ignores unique patterns; discard for future, as patterns seem input-derived or rule-based like binary/Morse).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have detected some frames (borders preserved for all four: 2's at top, 4's, 3's, 1's at bottom) but erased most inner patterns and added incorrect sparse dots (e.g., for top 2's frame, middle row3 has 2's at col7,9,11 but expected likely full or different pattern like alternating or clustered based on training style; similarly for 4's middle row9: 4's at col7,9,11 sparse, but training shows denser for similar colors; 3's and 1's have similar sparse adds missing expected sparser/single placements).
 * Extra background rows at bottom are clean (good), but inners are overly simplified/erased (e.g., no dense fills seen in train2 style), and some side rows have lingering 8's that should be bg if noise; does not match expected clean preservation of unique patterns per frame.
 * To handle test, need to preserve input inners within frame bounds (e.g., mark entire frame rect including inners, then remove only external non-bg); current output looks like partial erasure + wrong adds, leaving incomplete patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns that resemble letter-like structures (e.g., H-shapes or similar bar-connected forms) made of colored pixels, where the task is to detect thick horizontal bars with thin vertical supports and complete missing crossbars or connections in the middle rows based on color-specific rules, while preserving the background and removing noise. The program modifies the input grid in-place to fill these completions, then cleans up small artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns consist of 5-row high structures: full thick bars (same color) at top (row i) and bottom (row i+4), thin vertical lines (only edges non-bg, middle bg) in rows i+1 to i+3, spanning a fixed width (e.g., 11 columns from L to R).
 * Completions occur only in the exact middle row (i+2) of the pattern, placing color pixels at specific relative positions (e.g., for color 4, potentially at offsets like 6 and 8 from L, but logic must account for nearby structures to avoid overfilling).
 * Color-specific rules for filling: Different colors trigger different fill patterns (e.g., c=4 may fill two positions if no adjacent interference, c=1/3/5 fill varying numbers of positions in the second block); must check for "has_middle" (non-bg/non-c in middle row after R) and "has_other" (similar in adjacent rows) to decide fills.
 * Background (bg) is the most common color; small connected components (<7 pixels, 8-connected) of non-bg should be erased to bg after filling to remove noise.
 * Subtlety: Fills must not overwrite existing non-bg; patterns may overlap or be adjacent (e.g., in example 3, 1's bar near edge affects fills); hardcoded L/R positions (1-11, 2-12) miss wider/shifted bars or vertical orientations.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x23 in examples), rows vary but patterns are vertically stacked with bg separators; no diagonal connections in component detection.
 * Easy to miss: Thin rows must have exactly bg in interior (L+1 to R-1), but edges at L and R non-bg; fills are conditional on no interference from other colors post-R; remove_small_components uses stack-based flood fill (8 directions, excluding self).
 * All modifications are in a copy of the grid (result); original g unchanged during detection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing patterns and noise removal; works in all examples where bg=1 or 8 or 3.)

```python
def remove_small_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> None:
    if threshold <= 0:
        return
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                c_comp = g[i][j]
                size = 0
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    size += 1
                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                                continue
                            nx = x + dx
                            ny = y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == c_comp:
                                visited[nx][ny] = True
                                stack.append((nx, ny))
                if size < threshold:
                    for x, y in component:
                        g[x][y] = bg
```
(This performs 8-connected flood fill to erase small same-color components < threshold size; helpful for post-fill cleanup, though threshold=7 may need tuning; correctly identifies components but not used effectively here due to no fills happening.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The fill_bars function is overly hardcoded to specific L/R (1-11 and 2-12), missing patterns in training examples (e.g., example 1 4-bar at cols 1-11 should fill row 3 cols 7,9,11 with 4, but generated has no fills, leaving row 3 as [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,...] vs expected [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,...]; similar for 8-bar row 9 missing fills like cols 3,5,7,9,11 with 8).
 * For color=4 logic in first block, has_middle/has_other checks fail to trigger fills (e.g., in example 1, adjacent 1's bg don't qualify as "other", so no fills; unknown why it doesn't set result[m][7]=4 and [9]=4 as fallback).
 * Second block (L=2,R=12) never triggers in examples (e.g., example 1 has no matching c=1/3/5 patterns there; example 3 1-bar at cols 1-11 doesn't match L=2, so no fills in row 16 cols ~7-9 with 1).
 * In example 2 (bg=8), 1-bar (rows 2-6, cols 2-12) should fill row 4 col 10 with 1 (expected [...,1,8,1,...] at col10), but generated has full thin bg, no fill; similar misses for 6-bar row 10 cols 6,8,10,12? with 6, and 4-bar row 16 cols 8,10,12? with 4.
 * Example 3 (bg=3) generated extra/misplaced 1's in rows 1-5 cols 16-18 (from unknown source, perhaps erroneous detection), and misses fills like row 9 cols 7,9,11 with 4; row 16 cols 7,9 with 1 (expected has 1 at col7 in row15? but generated all thin bg).
 * Overall, no training example passes: generated preserves input but adds no correct fills, leading to incomplete crossbars; small component removal doesn't activate since no new small pieces created.
 * The program function correctly copies grid and applies steps in order (fill then remove), but fill_bars is broken/not general (doesn't scan all possible i/L/R, color rules incomplete).
 * find_background and remove_small_components are helpful and correct but underutilized (no noise in inputs, so removal inert).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=8) incorrectly adds stray 2's (e.g., row 5 col 18=2, outside main 2-bar cols 1-11; row 6 cols 16-20=2, creating unintended horizontal bar not in input) and preserves incomplete thin rows without fills (e.g., 2-bar rows 2-4 all bg interiors, no crossbar in row 3; similar for 4-bar row 9 no fills, 3-bar row 15 no fills, 1-bar row 21 no fills).
 * It does not look correct: Expected should complete crossbars similarly to training (e.g., for 2-bar rows1-5 cols1-11, fill row3 with 2's at specific positions like cols 5,7,9 based on color rules; but generated has no such fills, and extra 2's suggest buggy detection/overreach beyond hardcoded L/R).
 * Misses pattern at bottom (1-bar rows19-23 cols1-11 likely needs fills in row21 cols ~5,7,9 with 1, but none present); the stray fills (e.g., row6 2's) indicate the hardcoded blocks are firing incorrectly on non-matching patterns, breaking the grid.
 * To handle test, need general pattern scanning (all possible L/R widths, all colors) and interference checks (e.g., nearby 2's in row6 col18 shouldn't trigger extraneous fills).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain partial or outlined "symbols" (likely letters or shapes) formed by aligned vertical "legs" (spans of the same non-background color) in three consecutive rows, flanked by full top and bottom bars of the same color; the program must detect these alignments and complete the 5-row-high symbol by filling specific internal patterns unique to each color (1,2,3,4,6,8), while removing any small disconnected components at the end. The background color is the most common in the grid, and symbols are drawn on a background-filled output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Symbols span exactly 5 rows: a full top bar (row s), three rows of "legs" (rows s+1 to s+3, where legs are vertical non-background spans separated by background, at least 10 units wide in the examples), and a full bottom bar (row s+4); only alignments where all three legs overlap in the same columns and match top/bottom bars trigger drawing.
 * Internal patterns vary by color and are not uniform: e.g., for color 4, the third leg row (s+3, 0-indexed within block) has isolated fills at specific offsets like columns 7,9,11; for color 8, the second leg row has a dotted pattern every other column (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9,11); for color 2, the third leg row has fills at column 9 and 11; for color 1, similar dotted or offset patterns in middle rows; these seem to resemble letterforms (e.g., 4 like 'A' with crossbar, 8 like 'B' with curves, 2 like 'Z' with diagonal).
 * Leg detection must handle "clean" separations: a leg starts with color c, followed by background gap (at least 1?), then another c, but the code's find_legs looks for c, then background(s), then c again with no non-bg in gap, and requires span >=10; however, it skips if extra c's appear immediately after, and it doesn't correctly identify multi-leg structures or varying widths.
 * The "k" value for filling central patterns depends on color but also subtly on position (l, s) or size; current get_k is ad-hoc and incorrect (e.g., for c=4, it uses c//2+1=3, but expected patterns suggest more/less fills; for c=2, it varies by s==1, but examples show consistent per-color logic).
 * Background is correctly the mode color (1 in train1, 8 in train2/ test), but output starts fully bg-filled.
 * Post-processing removes components <20 cells, which is helpful to clean noise but may remove intended small parts if patterns have thin elements; in examples, it doesn't affect mains but could if internals are sparse.
 * Grids are ~22x23, with symbols left-aligned (starting col~1), separated by bg rows; multiple symbols per grid (e.g., train1 has 4,8,2; test has 2,4,3,1).
 * Subtle: Patterns may step inward or have offsets (e.g., effective_r = l+10 assumes fixed 10-width, but legs vary); filling in mid_row (s+2) goes left every 2 steps for k times, but expected shows right-side or centered dots/bars; for some colors (3?), no internals needed, just frame.
 * Overlaps or adjacent symbols must not interfere (e.g., train3 has 2,4,1 with bg=3, no bleed).
 * Easy to miss: Legs aren't always full-height in input (input shows only legs, program adds top/bottom/internals); detection requires exact column overlap across three rows; colors are digits 1-8, bg varies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the most common color, used in all examples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(This verifies full bars, essential for top/bottom checks; works but assumes exact span match.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))
    size = 1
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(This flood-fill computes connected component size and cells; very helpful for final cleanup of small noise <20 cells, as used in program; prevents false positives from tiny blobs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects background and initializes output as full bg.
 * It identifies leg positions in rows s+1 to s+3 via find_legs (which looks for c-bg(s)-c patterns with clean bg gap and span>=10), finds common column overlaps across three rows, and verifies top/bottom full bars— this works for positioning the outer frames (top full, bottom full, left/right sides in mid rows) in all training examples and test.
 * For train1 (bg=1, symbols at ~rows1-5 for4,7-11 for8,13-17 for2): Outer frames drawn correctly (e.g., full 4's top/bottom cols1-11, sides at col1/11 in rows2-4; similar for8 cols1-11,2 cols1-11), and small component removal doesn't erase mains.
 * For train2 (bg=8, symbols at ~rows2-6 for1? but actually1's are thin, then8-12 for6,14-18 for4): Frames correct (e.g.,6's top/bottom full cols2-12, sides col2/12;4's similar), but note train2 input likely has legs for1,6,4.
 * For train3 (bg=3, symbols at ~rows1-5 for2,7-11 for4,13-17 for1): Frames correct (e.g.,2's cols1-11, etc.).
 * Test output: Detects and frames symbols correctly for2 (rows1-5 cols1-11),4 (7-11),3 (13-17? but3 is solid? wait, legs for3?),1 (19-23 cols1-11), with bg=8 and separations.
 * What didn't work: Internal patterns completely missing or wrong in all cases—program only draws left side (col l), right side (col r in rows s+1,s+3; effective_r=l+10 in s+2), and a backward every-2-step fill in s+2 for k steps (based on flawed get_k, e.g., for c=4 k=3 so fills 3 positions left from l+10, but expected has forward/right-side isolated fills like col7,9,11 in row s+3 for4).
 * Specific differences: Train1 for4 block (rows~1-5): Generated has empty internals (only sides), expected has in row3 (s+2?): 4 at cols7,9,11; row4 (s+3): nothing extra but wait, expected row3 has 4 at1,7,9,11? (mismatch in which row); for8 block row9 (s+2 for8): generated empty, expected 8 at3,5,7,9,11 (dotted); for2 block row15 (s+2): generated empty, expected 2 at9,11. Train2 for1 block (rows~2-6): generated has sides only (but1's expected has internals in row4:1 at9? from pattern), diff: missing dots at col9,11 in row4; for6 block row10 (s+2): empty vs expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11? wait row10 expected 6 at3,5,7,9,11 (full row11? no, row10 is s+2 with dots); for4 block row16 (s+2): empty vs expected 4 at9,11. Train3 similar misses: for4 row9 empty vs expected 4 at7,9,11; for1 row15 empty vs expected 1 at7,9,11. Reasons unknown but likely wrong filling logic (backward vs forward, wrong row, wrong k/positions).
 * find_legs is partially helpful (detects spans) but broken: it requires exact c-bg-c with no extras, skips if post-gap has immediate c, assumes fixed ~10 width via effective_r=l+10 (but legs vary, e.g., train1 4's legs cols1-1? no, legs are single-col? wait, input legs are thin verticals at edges, but code treats as wide span); it misses multi-col legs or non-10 widths, leading to wrong effective_r and common sets.
 * get_k is unhelpful/broken: ad-hoc rules don't match patterns (e.g., c=1 uses l which is position, but patterns are fixed per color; c=2 depends on s==1, but train1/3 2's at different s have similar patterns; c=3=1, but train3 1's? wait 1's pattern; c=8=6 fixed, but expected dots suggest variable).
 * Overall, core detection works (positions/frames), but internals fail due to wrong pattern logic, wrong widths, and no per-color templates; small removal is fine but irrelevant here as no noise shown.
 * Program loops s in 0 to h-5, checks legs in s+1..s+3, good for multiple blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output frames the symbols correctly (e.g., full top/bottom for each block, sides at col1/11 or similar, separations with bg=8 rows), matching the structure of training examples, but lacks all internal patterns, just like the training failures—e.g., for the 2 block (rows1-5), expected likely has dots/bars in row3 or4 (similar to train1's 2 with fills at9,11); for4 (rows7-11), missing crossbar-like fills (e.g., at7,9,11); for3 (rows13-17), possibly solid or minimal but code draws frame only; for1 (rows19-23), missing dotted internals (e.g., every other from right). This does not look correct because training expects color-specific internals (dots, bars) inside the frames, not empty; the output resembles incomplete outlines, failing to "complete" the symbols as in expected trains. To handle test, need per-color pattern templates (e.g., dict of fill positions/rows) instead of generic k-fill, and better leg width detection (not fixed +10).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with incomplete 5-row-high block (or "frame") structures of specific colors against a uniform background, where the goal is to detect these blocks and complete them by solidifying the top and bottom bars, adding vertical side walls, filling the interior with background color, and inserting a characteristic pattern of isolated color pixels in the central inner row (offset +2 from the block start), while potentially removing small noise components elsewhere in the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks are always exactly 5 rows high (searched via starts at i and ends at i+4), with widths based on long consecutive runs (>=10 cells) of the same non-background color in the top and bottom rows; the left/right edges are determined by min/max of the run positions across top/bottom.
 * Detection requires matching color c between top/bottom runs, with the bottom run being fully solid (no gaps of bg inside the run), and complete vertical side walls already present in the input grid at the edge columns for all 3 inner rows— this is a subtlety that's easy to miss, as it assumes partial completeness in input (sides present but top/bottom possibly gappy), but may fail for more incomplete inputs.
 * Completion fills top/bottom fully solid with c across the block width, sets sides to c in inner rows (overwriting if needed), fills all inner columns (between sides) with bg in all inner rows, then adds pattern only in the middle inner row (start_r + 2).
 * The pattern is a set of isolated c pixels placed every 2 columns inward from the right edge (col = right - 2*ii for ii=1 to k), not connected to sides or each other (separated by bg), forming "protrusions" or "teeth" from the right wall; k appears tied to c (roughly floor(c/2) or similar, capped ~4), but inconsistent across examples—e.g., c=1 has k=1 in train2 but k=2 in train3; c=2 has k=1 in train1 but k=0 (no pattern) in train3; c=4 consistently k=2; c=6 k=3; c=8 k=4 (full every-other-column alternating across the width). This variability suggests k may depend on c combined with block width/position or input hints, not purely c; easy to miss that for small c (1-2), patterns can be absent or minimal, and positions shift if left/right vary (e.g., 1-11 vs. 2-12).
 * Background is always from top-left corner (g[0][0]), uniform, and non-block areas remain unchanged except for potential cleaning.
 * After completion, small connected components (<10 cells) of any non-bg color are flood-filled and set to bg; this removes noise but crucially also erases the isolated pattern pixels (each size 1, not adjacent), which must be preserved in expected outputs—subtle bug: cleaning should be restricted (e.g., only outside blocks, or only for non-block colors, or min_size=1 for block interiors) to avoid this.
 * Blocks don't overlap and are separated by bg rows; multiple blocks per grid, independent.
 * Input incompleteness: Tops/bottoms may have gaps (code fills them if detected), but sides must be fully present for detection (has_side_walls checks input g, not output); if sides missing, block skipped entirely.
 * Widths are ~11 cells (run >=10), but exact left/right can shift (e.g., col 1-11 or 2-12), affecting pattern cols; pattern never touches left side, always biased to right.
 * No patterns in non-middle inner rows; all inner rows except middle are pure bg between sides.
 * Potential noise: Small non-block blobs in input may need cleaning, but block patterns (even small) must stay.
 * Edge cases: For c=1/2, patterns optional/absent in some blocks (e.g., train3 c=2 has none); k max 4 even for large c; patterns are single pixels, not bars, so connectivity is zero beyond isolation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful building blocks for detection and completion, though buggy in pattern logic and cleaning.

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color from the top-left corner."""
    return g[0][0]
```
(This is solid and correctly identifies bg=1,8,3 across examples.)

```python
def find_long_run(row: List[int], bg: int, min_len: int = 10) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """Find the first long run of non-background color in the row."""
    # (Implementation as provided; helpful for locating potential block edges via first >=10 run of same non-bg.)
    # Returns (color, left_idx, right_idx) or (None, None, None).
```
(This works well for spotting top/bottom runs; subtle: assumes first run only, ignores multiples in row.)

```python
def is_solid_run(row: List[int], bg: int, L: int, R: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Check if the segment from L to R in row is solidly color c."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for verifying bottom row solidity in input.)
```
(Helpful for strict bottom check, but could be relaxed for incomplete inputs.)

```python
def has_side_walls(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, L: int, R: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Check if all inner rows have color c at columns L and R."""
    # (Implementation as provided; checks input g for full sides, key for detection but brittle if input incomplete.)
```
(Useful but limiting; suggestion: modify to check partial sides or fill regardless if top/bottom match.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    """Find all 5-row block structures based on solid top/bottom and side walls."""
    # (Implementation as provided; core detection logic, returns list of (start_r, end_r, left, right, c).)
```
(Helpful overall, but fails if sides incomplete; integrates above functions well.)

```python
def complete_block(out: List[List[int]], bg: int, block: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]):
    """Complete a detected block: fill top/bottom solid, sides in inner rows, and middle pattern."""
    # (Implementation as provided, but pattern k = min(4, c // 2) is approximate/wrong for some cases; adds isolated pixels.)
```
(Helpful structure, but broken pattern calc (e.g., k=0 for c=1 misses expected k=1/2); fills bg inner correctly.)

```python
def clean_small_components(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 10):
    """Flood fill and remove small connected components of non-background colors."""
    # (Implementation as provided; uses 4-dir connectivity, cleans any non-bg < min_size in out.)
```
(Helpful for noise removal, but broken/not helpful as-is because it erases intended isolated pattern pixels (size 1); don't use without mods like skipping block interiors or block colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) demonstrates partial understanding by correctly detecting blocks when sides are present in input, filling top/bottom solid with c, adding sides in inner rows, and filling inner areas with bg, which matches the structural completion in all generated outputs.
 * What worked: Background detection always correct; long-run finding identifies block edges accurately; for cases where blocks are detected (sides present), the frame (top/bottom/sides) is completed properly, and out grid is copied from input initially to preserve non-block areas.
 * What didn't work: Pattern addition uses incorrect/arbitrary k = min(4, c//2), leading to mismatches—e.g., train1 c=2 (k=1 expected, code k=1 but cleaned away); train2 c=1 (k=1 expected, code k=0 no add); train3 c=1 (k=2 expected, code k=0 no add); train3 c=2 (k=0 expected, code k=1 would add but cleaned). Even when added, patterns are always erased by cleaning due to isolation (size 1 components <10), resulting in all inner rows being pure bg except sides in generated vs. expected (e.g., train1 row3 missing 4's at cols 7/9; train2 row4 missing 1 at col 10; train3 row15 missing 1's at 7/9).
 * Detection brittle: Relies on input having full sides (has_side_walls on g), skipping incomplete blocks; but generated shows completion happened, implying inputs had sides but gappy top/bottom.
 * Cleaning function is conceptually helpful for noise but practically broken for this puzzle, as it removes essential small pattern components uniformly (no distinction for block interiors/colors); unhelpful without fixes—avoid using as-is.
 * For train1: Generated fills frames correctly but inner rows all bg except sides (no pattern in row3/9/15); differs from expected by missing isolated c pixels in middle row (e.g., row3 lacks 4 at 7/9; row9 lacks 8 at 3/5/7/9; row15 lacks 2 at 9)—effect: blank interiors instead of patterned.
 * For train2: Similar frame completion, but row4 lacks 1 at 10; row10 lacks 6 at 6/8/10; row16 lacks 4 at 8/10 (plus misaligned sides at col2/12 vs. expected); differs by missing right-biased patterns and some inner 1's/6's/4's in middle rows—effect: over-filled bg in patterns, partial mismatch in row4/10/16 positions.
 * For train3: Frames filled, but row9 lacks 4 at 7/9; row15 lacks 1 at 7/9; row3/4/15 have no pattern where expected (or none for c=2); differs by missing patterns in middle rows for c=4/1 blocks, and correctly absent for c=2 but code would wrongly add if not cleaned—effect: blank for patterned blocks, unknown if c=2 absence is intentional or detection failure.
 * No function for extracting/handling incomplete blocks (e.g., predict sides if top/bottom match); pattern logic needs data-driven k (e.g., map c to k from examples).
 * Overall, structural completion works ~70%, but pattern omission via wrong k + cleaning makes all incorrect.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it follows the same pattern as training generated outputs by completing block frames (solid top/bottom with c=2/4/3/1 in rows 1-5/7-11/13-17/19-23, sides at ~col1/11 or similar, inner bg) against bg=8, but lacks any patterns in middle rows (e.g., row3 for c=2 block all bg inner except sides, but expected likely needs k=1 protrusion like train1 c=2 at ~col9; row9 for c=4 likely needs 2 protrusions at ~7/9; row15 for c=3 unknown but likely some; row21 for c=1 likely 1-2 at ~9 or 7/9).
 * Differences: No isolated c pixels in middle rows (all erased by cleaning or not added due to k logic); e.g., bottom c=1 block row21 has only sides, but based on train2/3 c=1, should have 1-2 near-right pixels; top c=2 row3 blank inner, but train1 c=2 had one—effect: sterile frames without the defining color-specific "teeth" patterns, making it incomplete like trainings.
 * To handle test: Update k logic (e.g., k = c // 2 for most, but special case c=1/2); modify cleaning to preserve small c-components inside block bounds (e.g., mark block areas, skip flood-fill there); relax detection for incomplete sides; assume similar width ~11, right-biased patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids with background cells and incomplete "balloon" or "blob" shapes made of colored cells (non-background). The goal is to detect specific 5-row high patterns (full horizontal span at top and bottom, thin vertical connections on the sides in the three middle rows) and complete them by filling a patterned interior in the central middle row (row start+2) using a color-specific pattern, then remove any remaining small connected components (size <20) that aren't part of valid completed shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 5 rows tall: a starting row with a horizontal span of >=10 consecutive cells of the same color (non-bg), a bottom row (start+4) that is fully filled with that color across the exact same span (no gaps, sides must align), and three middle rows (start+1 to start+3) that are "thin" (only the leftmost and rightmost cells of the span are the shape's color, with all interior cells strictly background; no extra colors or protrusions inside or outside the span in those rows).
 * Filling happens only in the exact central middle row (start+2), using a stepped pattern (every 2 cells starting from a color-specific offset within the span); the pattern must not overwrite existing side cells but adds interior ones. Different colors have unique offsets and patterns (e.g., color 8: dense alternating fill starting from left; color 4: sparser fill starting ~6 cells from left, adding 3 interior cells at positions like 7,9,11 for span 1-11; color 2: even sparser, starting ~8 from left, adding 2 interior cells like 9,11; color 1 similar to 4 but sometimes skips some positions; color 6: alternating but denser than 4, starting earlier). Over-filling (e.g., adding extra cells not in expected) breaks the pattern.
 * A key condition is that fewer than 3 of the middle rows can have "interfering" elements outside the span (i.e., cells that are non-bg and not the shape's color); if >=3 middle rows have such interference (e.g., parts of other shapes), don't fill to avoid corrupting adjacent objects. Shapes must not overlap or interfere horizontally in middle rows.
 * Background is always the most common cell value across the entire grid (via flat count); assume rectangular grid, all rows same width.
 * After all fills, perform 4-way connected flood-fill (up/down/left/right, same color only) to identify components and erase any with total size <20 cells (prevents noise or incomplete partials from remaining, but completed shapes are large enough ~28+ cells even unfilled due to connections, larger after fill).
 * Subtle: Spans must be exact matches top-to-bottom (same left/right positions); multiple shapes per grid, separated by bg; detection scans from top (start_row 0 to h-5); input likely has outlines already (full top/bottom + side stubs in middles), but fill only adds interior pattern if all conditions met—missing sides in input would fail "thin" check. Easy to miss: vertical connectivity makes unfilled shapes survive size check (~28 cells via top bar + bottom bar + 6 side cells); patterns are asymmetric or offset per color, not uniform; removal happens post-all-fills on a copy to avoid interfering with detection.
 * Grids are ~23x23, but generalize; no diagonal connections; only horizontal spans trigger (no vertical or diagonal patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg as most common value, essential for all checks.)

```python
def find_span(row: List[int], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int] | None:
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            length = i - start
            if length >= 10:
                return color, start, i - 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return None
```
(Helpful: Finds the first horizontal run of >=10 non-bg cells in a row, returns color + exact left/right bounds; critical for span detection, but assumes only one qualifying span per row—may miss if multiples.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= len(row):
        return False
    for k in range(left, right + 1):
        if row[k] != color:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Verifies exact span is solidly filled with color, no bg or other intrusions; key for bottom row check.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], color: int, left: int, right: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    if left < 0 or right >= w:
        return False
    if row[left] != color or row[right] != color:
        return False
    for k in range(left + 1, right):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Helpful: Confirms "thin neck" structure—sides present, interior strictly bg; essential for all three middle rows, fails if sides missing or interior cluttered.)

```python
def has_other_in_row(row: List[int], color: int, bg: int, left: int, right: int, w: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(w):
        if left <= k <= right:
            continue
        if row[k] != bg and row[k] != color:
            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful: Detects interference outside span in a row (non-bg, non-shape-color cells); used to count per middle row, ensures <3 rows affected before filling.)

```python
def compute_component_size(grid: List[List[int]], si: int, sj: int, color: int) -> Tuple[int, set]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if si < 0 or si >= h or sj < 0 or sj >= w or grid[si][sj] != color:
        return 0, set()
    visited = set()
    stack = [(si, sj)]
    visited.add((si, sj))
    size = 1
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and grid[nx][ny] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                size += 1
    return size, visited
```
(Helpful: 4-way flood-fill to compute connected component size and cells for a starting cell/color; crucial for post-process removal of small blobs <20; returns size and set of positions for targeted erasure.)

The `fill_row` function from the attempt is partially helpful (applies stepped pattern based on color) but broken in offsets/steps for some colors (e.g., overfills for color=1, underfills/skips for color=6; returns early for unknown colors, preventing any fill).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it demonstrates partial understanding: correctly detects bg, scans for 5-row structures via span/full/thin checks, applies color-specific stepped fills in middle row, and removes small components post-fill.
 * Worked: Structure detection logic (span >=10, exact bottom full, all middle thin, interference <3 rows) is solid in concept; removal via flood-fill correctly preserves large connected shapes (e.g., unfilled balloon ~28 cells via top/bottom bars + sides survives >20 threshold); patterns match exactly for some cases (e.g., train2 color=4 adds correct 8,10,12; train1 color=8 alternating if triggered; train1 color=4 adds 7,9,11 matching expected).
 * Didn't work: Fill never triggers in any training output (generated matches input outlines exactly—no interior patterns added), likely due to implementation bug (e.g., is_thin fails silently if input middles lack sides, but generated shows sides present, suggesting input already has outlines and detection skips for unknown reason like span bounds mismatch or loop indexing error); for train1, expected adds patterns to row3 (4's: +7,9,11), row9 (8's: alternating 1,3,5,7,9,11), row16 (2's: +9,11), but generated has only sides everywhere; for train2, expected adds to row4 (1's: +10,12 but code would wrongly add 8,10,12), row10 (6's: alternating 2,6,8,10,12 but code skips entirely via else return), row16 (4's: +8,10,12 matching but not added), generated only sides; for train3, expected adds denser patterns (4's row9: +5,7,9,11 but code only +7,9,11 missing 5; 1's row15: +5,7,9,11 but code +7,9,11 missing 5; 2's no fill needed, matches generated), but generated only sides (no adds anywhere); subtle: code's offsets (e.g., +6 for 1/4, +8 for 2, 0 for 8) are close but incomplete/wrong for 1/6 (needs adjustment like +4 or different step for density); num_with_other <3 prevents false positives but may over-block if minor interference.
 * Missed: Handling all colors (e.g., no pattern for 6, partial for 1/2/4 across examples); potential bug in triggering fill (e.g., range(h-4) misses lower shapes if h small; assumes first span only, may skip if multiple); doesn't add missing sides if input lacks them (but generated suggests input has them).
 * extract_objects not present, but compute_component_size serves as essential tool for post-removal (would be useful pre-process to isolate shapes).
 * fill_row is partially helpful for patterned fill but broken/not general (hardcoded offsets fail for train3 4's/1's by missing positions like +5; skips unknown colors; step=2 too rigid—some patterns may need step=1 or variable).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it replicates the input outlines (full top/bottom spans + thin sides in all three middle rows for each of four shapes: 2's rows1-5, 4's rows7-11, 3's rows13-17, 1's rows19-23) with no interior fills added, similar to all training generated outputs; based on training expecteds, it should add color-specific patterns to the central middle row (start+2) for each shape if conditions met (e.g., for 2's row3: add ~9,11 as in train1; for 4's row9: add ~7,9,11 or denser per train3; for 3's row15: unknown pattern but likely some interior like others; for 1's row21: add ~7,9,11 or denser). No small components removed (but none qualify as shapes are connected >20 even unfilled). This suggests same trigger failure as training (no changes), making output incomplete—expected would have patterned interiors (e.g., sparse dots/clusters per color) while preserving outlines and bg=8 elsewhere; without fills, shapes remain "incomplete" per puzzle rules. Do not look correct because they ignore the core completion step, leaving all shapes as mere outlines (mismatches all training expecteds' patterned bodies); to handle test, must fix trigger (e.g., verify input has sides, adjust offsets for 3/1 if similar to 4), ensure patterns match example densities (e.g., test 3's may need custom like alternating or +4 offset).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x23 grid (or similar dimensions) where the goal is to identify specific "frame" structures (hollow 5x11 rectangles of a single color with a fully background-filled 3x9 interior) made of non-background colors, erase all other non-background elements (treating them as noise or irrelevant components), and then repopulate the middle row of each frame's interior with a specific number of 1x1 "dots" of the frame's color. The number of dots (n) is determined by counting small connected components (1-8 cells, with bonuses for 2x2 or 3x3 filled squares) of the same color elsewhere in the grid, and the dots are placed right-aligned in the interior columns (1-9 relative to frame left), preferring opposite-parity columns to the frame's right edge first, then same-parity if needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the color in the top-left cell (e.g., 1 in training 1/2, 3 in training 3, 8 in test); all processing ignores it.
 * Frames must be exactly 5 rows high and 11 columns wide, with 25-30 cells total (hollow border), and the exact 3x9 interior (rows t+1 to t+3, cols l+1 to l+9) must be entirely background—no partial fills or leaks.
 * Connected components are 4-way (up/down/left/right), strictly same-color; frames are identified as the large border components meeting size/bbox/internal criteria.
 * For n (dots to place): Base count is number of small components (1-8 cells) of color c outside the frame; add (size-1) extra for each fully filled square component of 2x2 (add 1) or 3x3 (add 2). This seems to represent "values" or "morse-like" encodings from small blobs elsewhere.
 * Placement: In the frame's middle interior row (t+2), place n dots of color c in columns l+1 to l+9, right-aligned (highest columns first). Prioritize columns with parity opposite to the frame's right edge column (iright % 2), taking the rightmost n such; if n exceeds available opposite-parity slots (up to 5), spill to rightmost same-parity columns. No overlaps or extensions beyond interior.
 * All other non-background cells (not in any frame) must be erased to background before placing dots; frames themselves remain intact.
 * Subtleties: Parity-based placement ensures "alternating" or "gapped" positioning to match visual patterns (e.g., avoiding adjacent dots if possible); small components might be single cells, lines, or squares, but only filled squares get bonuses—irregular shapes count as 1 regardless of size (1-8). Frames don't overlap or nest. Grid edges are all background except frames. No rotation or diagonal connections. The middle row is always row index t+2 (0-based).
 * Easy to miss: Internal check must be exactly 27 background cells (3*9); frames might have slight variations in border thickness but must fit exact bbox. Counting skips the frame itself when tallying small components for n. Placement can leave gaps if n < 9, but always right-justified with parity preference. Background fill happens after component detection but before dot placement. Test grids may have more frames (4 in test vs. 3 in trainings) and different color orders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This is correct and essential; assumes uniform background.)

                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:

                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == c:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                all_comps.append((c, component))
    return all_comps
```
(This is helpful and correct; uses DFS stack for 4-connected same-color components, essential for extracting all objects/frames.)

```python

        max_i = max(p[0] for p in comp)
        min_j = min(p[1] for p in comp)
        max_j = max(p[1] for p in comp)
        h = max_i - min_i + 1
        w = max_j - min_j + 1
        if h != 5 or w != 11:
            continue
        # Check internal 3x9 all bg
        internal_count = 0

                if grid[ii][jj] == bg:

        if internal_count == 27:
            t = min_i
            l = min_j
            m = t + 2
            frames.append((t, l, c, m, comp))
    return frames
```
(This is mostly helpful; correctly identifies frames by size, bbox, and exact internal background count (27 cells). Minor issue: internal loop uses min_j +10, which is correct for 9 cols (1 to 9), but ensure no border bleed.)

```python
def fill_non_frame_cells(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, frame_cells: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all non-background cells not part of frames with background color."""
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    output = [row[:] for row in grid]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != bg and (i, j) not in frame_cells:
                output[i][j] = bg
    return output
```
(This is helpful and correct; clears noise while preserving frames, using a set for fast lookup—essential step before dot placement.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identified frames in all training examples (correct 5x11 bbox, size 25-30, full internal bg) and cleared non-frame cells to background, preserving frame borders intact.
 * Correctly grouped components by color using defaultdict(list), skipping the frame itself when counting small components for n.
 * Training example 2 passed fully, indicating the logic works for some patterns (likely where n=0 or simple right-aligned placement without spillover).
 * Failed in training 1: For color 4 frame (rows 1-5, cols 1-11), generated middle row (row 3) as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11? shifted left] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3 positions?]; for color 8 (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [8,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,8] (dense left with extras) vs expected [1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8,1,8] (alternating starting from col 1, 6 dots). Suggests n overcounted (too many dots) and/or wrong columns selected (not parity-preferred right-aligned).
 * Failed in training 3: For color 4 frame (rows 7-11), generated row 9 as [4 at cols 5,7,9,11—shifted] vs expected [4 at cols 7,9,11—rightmost 3]; for color 1 (rows 13-17), generated row 15 as [1 at cols 7,9,11—only 3] but expected has 1 at cols 7,9,11 (wait, appears similar, but actual diff is in row 15 matching but perhaps n=3 correct while earlier frames wrong); overall, placement shifted left, ignoring parity (e.g., if iright even, prefer odd cols rightmost).
 * compute_n_for_color overcounts or miscounts small components: Counts all 1-8 cell comps as +1, and filled 2x2/3x3 as +(ww-1), but in training 1 for color 8, there might be small blobs worth n=6 (alternating), but generated placed 8+ incorrectly; unknown if bonuses applied wrong (e.g., treating lines as squares).
 * get_placement_columns has parity logic but buggy: For iright even (e.g., l+10 even if l even), opp_par=odd, takes rightmost n odds (e.g., 9,7,5,...), but in generated, it places in even cols or leftward, suggesting wrong sorting or spillover (poss_opp[-n:] takes last n, which are rightmost if list is left-to-right).
 * program main flow is solid (bg -> comps -> frames -> group by color -> clear noise -> place dots per frame), but dot placement fails due to n miscalculation and column selection errors.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, but compute_n_for_color and get_placement_columns need fixes (e.g., verify filled square detection: check if hh==ww and pp==hh*ww and 2<=ww<=3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 4 frames (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23), clears all noise (e.g., no stray cells outside frames), and preserves borders, with background 8 everywhere else. However, interior fillings are wrong or incomplete: For color 2 (n likely 0, no small 2-blobs elsewhere), middle row 3 is all bg—correct (empty). For color 4 (row 9), generated [4,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,4] (dense with left bias, 6+ dots?) vs likely expected alternating right-aligned (e.g., 4 at cols 1,3,5,7,9 or rightmost 5 if n=5, but pattern looks like overcounted n=6 without parity, placing adjacently). For color 3 (row 15), [3 at col 9 only? sparse] suggests undercounted n=1, but if small 3-blobs exist (e.g., single or 2x2), expected might need 2-3 rightmost opposite-parity. For color 1 (row 21), [1 at cols 9,11? but extended] looks like n=2 but wrong columns (should be rightmost, e.g., 8+1=9 if odd preferred). Overall, placements are not right-aligned with parity (e.g., favors left/even cols), leading to non-alternating patterns; does not match visual consistency of trainings (e.g., expected would have gapped, right-heavy dots). Missing: Proper spillover handling if n>5, and exact n from small comps (test has potential 2x2/3x3 bonuses unseen).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detecting and reconstructing specific 5-row-high "ladder" or "table-like" structures in a grid, where each structure consists of colored bars and legs on a uniform background (8), and the output is a cleaned or redrawn version of the input grid with only valid structures rendered while ignoring or blanking invalid parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must span exactly 11 columns (full top and bottom bars), with thin legs only at the exact left and right ends in the three middle rows (no extra colors in between, which must be background).
 * Background is determined from the top-left cell; all non-structure areas in output are filled with background.
 * Middle row (row s+2) includes a crossbar connecting the legs, with length varying by color c: for c=1, it's position-dependent (4 - l); for c=2, it's 1 or 2 segments based on a side parameter s (possibly start position); for c>=3, it's roughly c//2 + 1 segments, placed from the right end and stepping left by 2 columns each time.
 * Structures cannot overlap or extend beyond grid height (must fit within h-4 rows from start s); once detected and drawn, mark the 5 rows as visited to skip reprocessing.
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from top, finds candidate top bars of exactly length 11 in input row s, validates middle rows for thinness (only ends colored with c, rest background), and bottom row for full span of c.
 * Subtlety: Crossbar drawing starts from right end (r) and extends left in even steps (pos -= 2), which can create asymmetric or partial connections (e.g., for higher c, more rungs; for c=1/2, shorter or conditional).
 * Only process non-visited rows; break after drawing one structure per starting row block to avoid multiples.
 * Easy to miss: Bars must be exactly contiguous length 11 (no longer/shorter); thin check is strict (any non-bg in middle leg rows invalidates); crossbar count k can be miscalculated for edge cases like l/r positions or low c values.
 * Input may have noisy or incomplete structures, so output reinitializes to bg and redraws only validated ones.
 * Grid width w assumed uniform; empty grid returns empty.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Determines bg reliably from top-left.)

        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))  # (left, right, color)
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans for exact 11-cell contiguous non-bg runs; essential for candidate detection.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Validates middle rows have only endpoint colors, rest bg; strict and key for leg thinness.)

```python
def is_full_span(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks bottom bar is fully colored with c; simple but critical.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l  # Position-dependent for c=1
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Conditional on s (start row?) for c=2
    return c // 2 + 1  # General formula for higher c
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; handles special cases for low c, but s param usage unclear and potentially buggy.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h:
        return

    # bottom
    for col in range(l, r + 1):

    # legs
    for mid in range(1, 4):

            output[row_idx][r] = c
    # crossbar (middle row only, from right, stepping left by 2)
    mid_row = s + 2
    if mid_row < h:
        output[mid_row][l] = c  # Left leg already set, but redundant here?
        output[mid_row][r] = c  # Right leg
        k = get_k(c, l, s)
        pos = r
        count = 0
        while count < k and pos >= l:
            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Core drawing logic; builds full structure including variable crossbar. Note: crossbar always includes endpoints, then adds k-? internals stepping left from r.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Prevents reprocessing drawn blocks; essential for non-overlapping detection.)

The main program orchestrates: init output to bg, scan rows, find/validate/draw/mark.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken, but get_k may be flawed for c=2 (s param is start row index, but logic "1 if s==1 else 2" seems arbitrary/unrelated to puzzle—possibly incorrect for test cases where s varies; could lead to inconsistent crossbars). find_bars skips bg correctly but assumes bars start after bg runs; might miss if bar touches edge (but i starts at 0, so okay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it successfully detected and redrew structures for all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection (11-bar top/bottom, thin legs) works for simple cases.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety in crossbar for c=2/1 not tested in training—could be why test needs review.
 * Visited marking and single-break per block prevented over-drawing in training.
 * No omissions or mismatches in training (all passed), but unknown if training had variable crossbars.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows four vertically stacked, non-overlapping 5-row structures (for c=2 at rows 1-5, c=4 at 7-11, c=3 at 13-17, c=1 at 19-23), each with full top/bottom 11-cell bars starting at col=1, thin legs at col=1 and col=11 for the three middle rows, and background elsewhere; separated by all-bg rows (0,6,12,18,24-26).
 * For c=2 and c=3: Middle row (row 3 for first, 9 for second? Wait, for c=2: row 3 has only col1=2 and col11=2 (thin, no crossbar fill); same for c=3 at row 15 (only ends).
 * For c=4: Middle row 9 has col1=4, col7=4, col9=4, col11=4 (three internal fills, stepping left from 11: pos=11,9,7 >=1).
 * For c=1: Middle row 21 has col1=1, col7=1, col9=1, col11=1 (same pattern as c=4).
 * This looks mostly correct assuming input had these structures (program redrew cleanly on bg); crossbars match get_k logic (for c=4: 4//2+1=3 segments; for c=1: if l=1, 4-1=3 segments; for c=3: 3//2+1=2, but output shows only ends—wait, discrepancy: for c=3 middle row 15: only col1=3, col11=3, no internals like col9 or col7, so crossbar not filled beyond legs, suggesting get_k(3,l=1,s=13)=2 but drawing only added 0 internals? Wait, drawing always sets l and r, then adds k more stepping left, but if k=2, it should set pos=11 (already r), pos=9; but output lacks col9=3, so either input didn't validate or get_k miscomputed (s=13 !=1, but for c=3 uses general formula). For c=2 at s=1: get_k=1 if s==1, so adds 1 more (pos=11 already, then pos=9=2), but output row3 has no col9=2—only ends, so crossbar addition failed or k=0 effectively. Thus, test output does NOT fully match expected clean redraw: missing internal crossbar fills for c=2/3 (only legs drawn, no rungs), while c=1/4 have them; this differs from expected (should have partial rungs per color formula), likely due to get_k bug for c=2 (conditional on s==1 but doesn't add enough) or drawing loop (count starts after endpoints? No, loop sets pos=r which is already set). For c=3, k=2 should add one internal (pos=9), but absent—unknown why (perhaps validation failed in input, but output shows structure drawn, so partial). Overall, structures detected correctly, but crossbars incomplete for lower c, making output incorrect for full reconstruction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the program must detect incomplete 5-row-high table-like structures (with a full top bar, thin vertical legs in the middle three rows, and a full bottom bar) in an input grid and complete them in the output grid by filling in a specific crossbar pattern in the central middle row (row s+2). The structures are 11 units wide, use a consistent non-background color c for each, and the crossbar consists of c-colored pixels placed every other column starting from the right leg and extending leftward, with the number of crossbar positions determined by rules based on c (to form digit-like or symbolic patterns).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must be exactly 5 rows high (s to s+4), with top (s) and bottom (s+4) rows having exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c (non-background), detected via run-length of length 11.
 * Middle three rows (s+1 to s+3) must be "thin" legs: only the left (l) and right (r = l+10) positions are c, with all positions between l+1 and r-1 being background (bg); any non-bg in between invalidates the structure.
 * Background bg is assumed to be the top-left cell value (g[0][0]); output grid starts as all bg and only modified where structures are drawn.
 * Crossbar is only in the exact central middle row (s+2), starting at pos = r and stepping left by 2 (pos -= 2) for k steps, where k depends on c: examples show k=1 for c=1 and c=2 (no visible extra beyond legs), k=2 for c=3 (adds one extra at r-2), k=3 for c=4 (adds two extras at r-2 and r-4), k=4 for c=6 (adds three extras at r-2, r-4, r-6); legs at l and r are always drawn in all middle rows, but crossbar may overlap r.
 * Structures do not overlap; use visited tracking to skip rows already covered (mark s to min(s+4, h) as visited after drawing).
 * Detection scans each possible starting row s from 0 to h-5, finds candidate bars only in top row s, validates bottom and middles, then draws if valid; only one structure per starting s (breaks after first valid).
 * Subtlety: Crossbar rule is c-dependent and not simply c//2 +1 (works for c=3,4,6 but overdraws for c=1 with k=3 instead of k=1); special case for c=2 depending on s (k=1 if s==1 else 2) is inconsistent and likely incorrect, as it ties to row position rather than fixed per-c rule.
 * Width w assumed constant across rows; ignore bars shorter/longer than 11 or with length !=11.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar does not fill continuously but skips every other column (step -2 from r); for small k (e.g., 1), it only reinforces the right leg (no new pixels); structures may appear in any order/position but are processed top-to-bottom without reordering.
 * Output must exactly match input's detected parts but complete the crossbars; no drawing if validation fails (e.g., bottom not full, middle not thin).
 * Considerations across attempts: Scanning only unvisited rows prevents overlap; early break after drawing one per s avoids multiples; but get_k overestimates k for low c like 1, leading to extra pixels.

(Helpful: Validates "thin legs" by checking only ends are c and interior is all bg; core to middle row validation.)

            output[mid_row][pos] = c
            pos -= 2
            count += 1
```
(Helpful: Draws the full structure if valid; fills top/bottom fully, legs at ends in middles, and crossbar every other from right; bounds-checked for h; but relies on broken get_k.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], s: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(s, min(s + 5, h)):
        visited[rr] = True

(Helpful: Marks 5 rows as visited to skip overlaps; essential for non-overlapping processing.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, s: int) -> int:  # Current version broken

    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2  # Inconsistent: should be fixed per c, e.g., 1
    return c // 2 + 1  # Works for c=3,4,6 but not low c
```
(Unhelpful/broken: Overdraws for c=1 (k=3 adds extras at r-2,r-4); special s-dependency for c=2 is arbitrary and likely wrong; needs rewrite to fixed per-c mapping, e.g., k = max(1, c // 2) or empirical: 1->1,2->1,3->2,4->3,6->4.)

The main program function orchestrates: init output/visited, scan s, find bars in g[s], validate full bottom and thin middles, draw if valid, mark visited. (Helpful overall structure, but fails due to get_k.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects structures via 11-long top bars, validates thin legs and full bottom, and draws tops/bottoms/legs accurately, as shown by training examples 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * What worked: For c=4 (k=3), crossbar correctly at r, r-2, r-4 (e.g., columns 12,10,8 plus leg at 2), matching expected; for c=6 (k=4), crossbar at r to r-6 step -2 (12,10,8,6 plus leg 2), matching expected; visited marking prevents overlaps, and thin/full checks are precise.
 * What didn't work: For c=1, get_k returns 3, drawing extra crossbar pixels at r-2=10 and r-4=8 (generated row 4: 1's at columns 2,8,10,12), but expected has only legs at 2 and 12 (no extras); this causes training example 2 to fail entirely due to mismatched middle row.
 * No other attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core detection/drawing logic; issue isolated to get_k for low c (1 and possibly 2).
 * find_bars, is_thin, is_full are essential and correct; draw_structure is mostly helpful but broken via get_k; mark_visited prevents errors in multi-structure grids.
 * get_k is broken/unhelpful in current form (overdraws extras for c=1, arbitrary s-dependency for c=2); don't use without fixing to per-c values (e.g., empirical mapping from examples).
 * Training 2 mismatches only in c=1 crossbar (extras at 8 and 10 unknown why expected omits, but clearly different: generated has four 1's, expected two); for c=4 and c=6, generated matches expected exactly (no differences noted).
 * No omissions or shape mismatches beyond crossbar; blob shapes match where k is correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it applies the same flawed logic: for c=1 (bottom structure, s=19?), k=3 draws extras at columns 7,9,11 (plus leg at 1: 1's at 1,7,9,11 in row 21), but based on training 2, this likely should be only legs at 1 and 11 (no extras, similar error as c=1 in training 2).
 * For c=2 (top structure, s=1), k=1 (due to s==1 special case) draws only at r=11 (already leg), resulting in only legs at 1 and 11 in row 3, which looks correct for a minimal crossbar (matches "1"-like thinness, no extras).
 * For c=4 (second structure, s=7?), k=3 draws at 11,9,7 (plus leg 1: 1,7,9,11 in row 9), which matches the pattern that worked in training 2, so likely correct.
 * For c=3 (third structure, s=13?), k=2 (3//2+1) draws at 11,9 (plus leg 1: 1,9,11 in row 15), which fits the incremental pattern (one extra vs. c=1/2), and looks sensible (no overdraw), likely correct.
 * Overall, test output is consistent with program logic but inherits the c=1 error (extra pixels in bottom structure's middle row); tops/bottoms/legs are correct everywhere; if c=1 should have no extras (as in training 2 expected), then test fails similarly—account for fixed k per c (e.g., 1 for c=1/2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4, 4 for 6) to handle low-c cases without s-dependency.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color B and multiple rectangular frames (borders) of various colors C, each with empty interiors filled with B. The goal is to remove all small connected components (blobs) of non-background colors scattered in the background areas by setting them to B, count the number N of such small blobs per color C (each component counts as 1 regardless of size), and then restore N pixels of color C inside each corresponding frame's interior on the middle row, placed in the rightmost min(N, 4) of 4 possible every-other-column positions (typically odd-offset columns like 3,5,7,9 relative to the frame start).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are fixed-width (11 columns) rectangles of height 4 or 5, with full top/bottom rows of C, side columns of C on inner rows, and interiors entirely B (if not all B, the frame isn't detected).
 * Small components are 4-directionally connected groups of the same non-B color with size 1-8; components larger than 8 are not removed or counted (likely part of frames or ignored).
 * Counting: Each small component of color C contributes exactly 1 to N for that C, regardless of size or shape—no special doubling for 2x2 squares of size 4 (this overcounts and is a key error in the attempt).
 * Placement inside frame: Only on the middle inner row (for height 5: second inner row; for height 4: first inner row). Use 4 possible slots in the 9-column interior, at relative offsets [1,3,5,7] from the left inner edge (fc+1), resulting in global columns fc+2, fc+4, fc+6, fc+8 (e.g., columns 3,5,7,9 if fc=1). Place C in the rightmost min(N,4) of these slots; leave others as B. Limit to 4 max, even if N>4.
 * Subtlety: All examples show frames starting at column 1 (fc=1), but the code searches for them. Background B is g[0][0], assumed consistent.
 * Subtlety: Removals happen across the entire grid (including any erroneous smalls inside frames, but frames are detected only if inner is all B, so inputs likely have empty inners). No smalls of frame color C are inside frames initially.
 * Easy to miss: Connected components use 4 directions (up, down, left, right); diagonals don't count. Visited array prevents recounting. No removal if size >8 or 0.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs preserve the original frames and background; only smalls are erased, and placements are added only inside detected frames.
 * Potential edge: If no smalls for a C (N=0), inner remains all B. If multiple frames of same C, each gets placements based on total N (code accumulates total small_count[C]).
 * Potential edge: Grid sizes vary slightly (e.g., 23x23 vs. 20x23), but frames are consistent. No frames overlapping or adjacent in examples.
 * The test input has frames for colors 1(odd),2(even),3(odd),4(even) with B=8; placements follow the same odd-column pattern as other examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies B from top-left; simple and reliable.)

```python
def find_frames(g: List[List[int]], B: int) -> List[tuple]:
    # Searches for 11-wide frames of height 4 or 5 with border C and inner all B.
    # Returns list of (C, start_row, start_col, height) for detected frames.
    # Helpful for isolating frames; works well in all examples (detects correctly, as placements happen in right locations).
    # Subtlety: Skips if top-left of potential frame is B; assumes no partial frames.
```
(This function is solid and detects frames accurately based on the rigid structure; key to the puzzle.)

```python
def process_smalls(g: List[List[int]], B: int, out: List[List[int]], frames: List[tuple]) -> dict:
    # Finds and removes (sets to B) all small (<=8 size) connected components of non-B colors using DFS/stack and visited grid.
    # Counts components per color in small_count dict (but current special case for size==4 2x2 adding +2 instead of +1 is broken and causes overcounting).
    # is_special logic for 2x2 squares is unhelpful/broken—not needed; treat all small components as +1.
    # Frames param is unused in function but passed; removal happens globally.
    # Helpful overall for removal and counting, but fix the counting to always +1 per component.
```
(This is mostly helpful for component extraction and removal, but the special case makes it incorrect for counting; remove the is_special and always +1 if not special.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: copies grid to out, gets B, finds frames, processes smalls (removes and counts), then places C pixels in frames based on N. Placement logic (rightmost slots via selected_rel = possible_rel[num_pos - to_fill:]) works well; fixed possible_rel=[1,3,5,7] matches most examples.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection via find_frames worked correctly in all cases (placements occur in expected frame locations and heights).
 * Small component removal worked (outers are cleared to B in outputs).
 * Placement positions worked for training 2 (correct overall) and partially for 1/3 (right number of slots from right, e.g., N=1 at col9, N=4 at 3/5/7/9, N=2 expected at 7/9 but code overplaced due to N error).
 * Counting in process_smalls failed for training 1 and 3: overcounted N for color 4 (placed 4 instead of expected 2 in train1; placed 3 instead of 2 in train3), likely due to broken special case for 2x2 size=4 components adding +2 each instead of +1 (e.g., two 2x2 would give N=4 wrong, should be 2).
 * For training 1: Generated extra inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3 positions) but expected only col7/9 (2); all other frames (2 and 8) matched expected positions and counts.
 * For training 3: Generated inner 4's at col5/7/9 (3) but expected col7/9 (2); color 2 had N=0 correctly (no inner); color 1 had inner 1's at col8/10 (possibly a transcription issue or code bug for odd C, but expected matches printed so may be correct, with mismatch elsewhere minor).
 * Training 2 passed fully, indicating core structure (detection, removal, placement from right) works when counts are accurate.
 * The is_special 2x2 logic is broken/unhelpful (leads to overcount; remove it to fix N).
 * No issues with background detection or grid copying.
 * Potential transcription error in training 3 color1 positions (col8/10 even cols vs. code's odd cols 7/9), but since expected matches printed generated, it may indicate need for parity-based rel (odd C use [2,4,6,8] for even cols 4/6/8/10, rightmost N); however, test uses odd cols for odd C=1/3, so likely always [1,3,5,7] and ex3 print is erroneous.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and consistent with the pattern: removes smalls (assumed), places rightmost N slots in odd inner columns (3,5,7,9) for all frames—e.g., for color 2 (even): 3 placements at col5/7/9 (rightmost 3); color 4 (even): 4 at 3/5/7/9; color 3 (odd): 1 at col9; color 1 (odd): 1 at col9. All in middle rows, frames intact, background 8 preserved.
 * It makes sense as an application of the rules (N=3 for 2, N=4 for 4, N=1 for 3 and 1), but without expected, can't confirm exact counts; positions match the core principle (rightmost every-other from left inner, odd cols). If ex3's even-col placement for odd C=1 is real, test's odd-col for odd C=1/3 doesn't match and would be incorrect—but likely ex3 print error, and test is correct.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids that contain incomplete "frame" or "window" structures outlined in a specific color c against a background, where the task is to detect these structures and complete them by rendering a pixel pattern inside the middle section that visually represents the digit corresponding to the color value c (e.g., drawing a "4" inside a frame of color 4), using c-colored pixels on the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frames are defined by: a top horizontal bar of exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c starting at column L in row s; a matching bottom bar in row s+4; vertical sides of c at columns L and R=L+10 in the three middle rows (s+1 to s+3), with background everywhere else in the middle section.
 * The output completes the frame by ensuring full top/bottom bars of c from L to R, full vertical sides of c in all middle rows at L and R, and crucially, adding a specific pattern of c pixels in ONE of the middle rows (usually s+2 as the "center," but sometimes s+3 for certain digits like 2) to render the digit c in a blocky, 1-row-high font style—positions are chosen to form the shape of the digit (e.g., alternating for 8, crossbar for 4, right-aligned for 1, bottom curve for 2/3).
 * Background color bg is typically the top-left cell (e.g., 1 or 8); output initializes to all bg and overlays the completed frames without overlapping or modifying outside areas.
 * Subtle: The pattern row and positions vary by digit c—not a simple formula like kk=c//2 inners from right on parity positions, but digit-specific (e.g., for c=8, dense alternating odds/evens filling most of center row; for c=4, sparse with crossbar around center-right; for c=2, pattern shifted to s+3 row with right-bottom emphasis; for c=1, right-aligned vertical with 2-3 points near R; for c=3, similar to 2 but with middle hook). Low c (1,2,3) often cluster pixels near the right side and may use non-center rows.
 * Detection scans each row s for runs of exactly length=11 non-bg, checks s+4 uniform c over [L,R+1], and verifies middle rows have only sides c at L/R with bg in between—no partial or overlapping frames assumed.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns are only in one middle row per frame (not all three); for even/odd L, parity affects position choice (e.g., evens for even L); special handling for c=1/2 (not fitting integer division); output must preserve original bg elsewhere; frames are 5 rows high, 11 cols wide, separated by empty rows.
 * Considerations across attempts: Overlays can accumulate if multiple detections, but examples show non-overlapping; test inputs have multiple frames stacked vertically with bg=8 and low c (1,2,3,4), requiring digit-specific rendering; incorrect pattern positions lead to wrong shapes (e.g., treating c=1 like c=4); row for pattern must be adjustable (s+2 default, but s+3 for c=2); no filling of top/bottom/sides if already present, but code reinitializes and sets them fully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This correctly extracts bg from top-left; useful for init and checks.)

```python
def is_uniform(row: List[int], start: int, length: int, color: int) -> bool:
    return all(row[j] == color for j in range(start, start + length))
```
(This verifies uniform bars/sides; essential for detection, works well in all attempts.)

(The frame detection loop in the program is helpful: scans for length=11 runs, checks s+4 uniform, verifies middle rows have only L/R as c with bg inside; collects frames as (s, L, R, c). This core logic succeeds for train3 and parts of 1/2.)

(No types defined; a Frame tuple (s: int, L: int, R: int, c: int) could help organize.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly detects frames via run-length scanning and uniform checks, successfully completing basic structure (top/bottom full bars, all middle sides) for all training examples where patterns match the flawed logic (e.g., train3 correct, likely had fitting c like 4/6/8).
 * What worked: Frame detection and basic filling (top s row L to R=c, bottom s+4 L to R=c, all middle rows L and R=c); pattern logic works for mid-high c (4,6,8) using reverse-sorted parity positions with kk=c//2, producing correct digit shapes like alternating for 8 (every odd/even), crossbar for 4 (positions ~7,9 + sides).
 * What didn't work: Pattern selection flawed for low c—uses special if c==1 (kk=2, p=1) or c==2 (kk=0, no inners), leading to incorrect/missing pixels; for c=1 in train2, sets inners at 9,11 but expected ~10,12 (right-clustered for digit 1, with bg at 11); for c=2 in train1, kk=0 skips inners entirely (generated sides-only in s+2), but expected has inners at 9,11 in s+3 row (bottom bar for digit 2); also minor bug in set_right logic (checks pattern_pos[0]==R-1 but for odds may mismatch evens); reinitializes out to bg and overlays, but doesn't preserve potential input pixels outside patterns.
 * Train1 incorrect: 4's and 8's match expected (correct digit shapes in s+2), but 2's has no inners in s+2 (generated all middle rows sides-only), while expected has pattern in s+3 row16 (positions 1,9,11=2 for digit 2 shape); unknown why only s+3 for 2, but it's different from default s+2.
 * Train2 incorrect: 6's and 4's match expected (even L=2, evens 6,8,10 + sides for 6; 8,10 + sides for 4, forming digits), but 1's center row4=s+2 has wrong positions (generated 2=1,9=1,11=1,12=1? but list shows extra/misplaced like col11=1 instead of bg, col9=1 too left), expected 2=1,10=1,12=1 with 11=8 bg (right-aligned for digit 1, clustered near R without filling 11); also generated has anomalous 1 at col12=1 but extra 1's misaligned.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had c values (e.g., 4/6/8) where the parity/kk logic fits digit shapes perfectly in s+2, no low-c specials needed.
 * The inner pattern code (if c==1/2 special, else p=L%2, kk=c//2, inner_pos=parity j in (L+1,R), reverse sort, take[:kk], set in center=s+2) is partially helpful for mid-high c but broken for low c (wrong kk/p, fixed row); don't use specials as-is—replace with digit-specific maps (e.g., dict of c to (pattern_row_offset, list of relative positions)).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_uniform) are relevant, though the full filling loop has bugs in low-c handling and set_right (sometimes over/under-sets R).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—it completes basic frames (top/bottom full, middle sides) for all (c=2 rows1-5, c=4 rows7-11, c=3 rows13-17, c=1 rows19-23) with bg=8, and patterns in s+2 for each, but uses flawed logic leading to wrong digit shapes for low c.
 * For c=2 (rows1-5, L=1,R=11): Only sides in center row3 (no inners, due to kk=0 special), but likely incorrect—based on train1, digit 2 needs inners at ~9,11 in s+3=row4 (bottom-right bar); current sides-only doesn't form a recognizable 2.
 * For c=4 (rows7-11, L=1,R=11): Center row9 has 1=4,7=4,9=4,11=4 (kk=2 odds reverse 9,7 + sides), which matches train1 4's and looks like digit 4 (crossbar right); this seems correct.
 * For c=3 (rows13-17, L=1,R=11): Center row15 has 1=3,9=3,11=3 (similar to c=4 but only 2 inners? Wait, code for c=3: p=1%2=1, kk=3//2=1, odds reverse take1:9, + sides 1,11), forming partial right cluster; may be ok for digit 3 (middle/bottom hook), but train2 suggests low c need right-clustering without left inners—looks plausible but unverified, potentially missing a pixel at ~7 or using wrong row.
 * For c=1 (rows19-23, L=1,R=11): Center row21 has 1=1,7=1,9=1,11=1 (code special kk=2 p=1 odds reverse 11,9 but sets 7? Wait, reverse 11,9,7,5,3 take2:11,9 + sides1,11; but list shows extra at7? Mismatch in generated list [8,1,8...7=1,8=8,9=1,10=8,11=1,12=8], actually 1,7,9,11—looks like c=4 shape, not digit 1; incorrect, should be right-clustered like train2 (e.g., ~8-11 with some bg, only 2-3 points near R) to form slim vertical 1.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (basic frames good, high-c like4 ok), but low-c (1,2,3) patterns don't form proper digits (too many/left-shifted inners or missing/shifted rows), failing to handle specials/subtleties; to fix, use digit-specific patterns (e.g., for c=1: offset=2, positions [0,8,10] relative to L; for c=2: offset=3, positions [0,8,10]) and test on train1/2 mismatches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the goal is to detect and render specific "structure" patterns (resembling tables or frames with top/bottom bars and side legs) made of consecutive colored cells against a background, then output a cleaned or completed version of the grid by drawing these structures explicitly, including color-specific crossbars in the middle of the leg sections. The structures must have exactly 11 consecutive cells for top/bottom bars, at least 2 "thin" leg rows (only endpoints colored, middle background), and the program processes from top to bottom, marking visited rows to avoid overlap.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures are defined by a top full bar of exactly length 11 (no longer/shorter runs detected, as find_bars skips to look for exactly 11), followed by consecutive thin rows (is_thin checks only endpoints are color c, all between are background), followed immediately by a bottom full bar of 11; if fewer than 2 thin rows or no bottom bar, no structure is drawn.
 * Background is always the top-left cell value (get_background), assumed uniform; output initializes to all background.
 * Processing is top-down (s increments, skipping visited), and only the first valid bar per starting row is drawn (drew=True breaks after one), potentially missing multiple structures per row if they exist.
 * Crossbar is added only in the computed mid_row of thin_rows (s + 1 + num_thin//2, which may not be perfectly centered for even num_thin), placed every other column starting from the right edge (r), for exactly k positions where k depends on color c via get_k: special cases for c=1 (4 - l, l=left index, assumes l=1 for k=3) and c=2 (1 if starting row s==1 else 2, oddly dependent on absolute row position); for c>=3, k = c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3, 3 for c=4).
 * Legs are only drawn at the exact input thin_rows positions (not filled vertically between top/bottom), preserving input sparsity; crossbar may overwrite leg pixels (e.g., rightmost always hits r) or add new colored cells in what was background in thin rows.
 * Visited marks all rows from s to bottom_rr inclusive, preventing re-detection of overlapping or adjacent structures.
 * Subtle: find_bars ignores runs shorter/longer than 11 and skips background; i < w-10 ensures room for 11-cell run; no handling for non-consecutive thin rows (must be immediate sequence) or structures not starting with full bar in non-visited row.
 * Easy to miss: Crossbar placement is right-aligned and spaced by 2 (pos -=2), creating dotted effect (e.g., columns 11,9,7 for k=3, r=11); for c=2 in first structure (s==1), minimal k=1 limits to right edge only; no vertical filling of legs, so output legs match input positions exactly; multiple structures are stacked vertically with background separators, but bottom rows remain all-background.
 * Considerations across attempts: Detection works for isolated vertical stacks but may fail if structures overlap horizontally/vertically or have varying leg counts; crossbar logic seems ad-hoc and position-dependent, potentially wrong for non-standard l or s; no error handling for empty/malformed grids; assumes all bars start at same column (e.g., col 1-11), as seen in test.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; essential for distinguishing structures.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        c = row[i]
        j = i
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            j += 1
        length = j - i

            res.append((i, i + 10, c))
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans row for exactly 11-consecutive non-bg runs, returning start, end (0-indexed), color; core for detecting top bars, ignores shorter/longer.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[j] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Checks if exact range l to r is entirely color c; used for top/bottom bars.)

```python
def is_thin(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int) -> bool:
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for j in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[j] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Verifies thin leg row: endpoints c, all interior bg; key for identifying leg sections without middle fills.)

```python
def draw_structure(output: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, thin_rows: List[int], bottom_rr: int) -> None:
    # Draw top
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        output[s][j] = c
    # Draw bottom
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        output[bottom_rr][j] = c
    # Draw legs
    for tr in thin_rows:
        output[tr][l] = c
        output[tr][r] = c
    # Draw crossbar
    num_thin = len(thin_rows)
    mid_row = s + 1 + (num_thin // 2)
    k = get_k(c, l, s)
    pos = r
    count = 0
    while count < k and pos >= l:
        output[mid_row][pos] = c
        pos -= 2
        count += 1
```
(Renders the detected structure: top/bottom full, legs at input thin positions, crossbar in computed middle row with k right-aligned every-2-columns segments; central to output generation.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar segment count; helpful but likely flawed—special cases for low c, position-dependent for c=2; may need generalization for varying l/s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only submission shown; detection of structures (top bar, consecutive thin legs >=2, bottom bar) worked perfectly for all 3 training examples, producing correct outputs.
 * Drawing top/bottom full and legs at exact thin positions worked in training, but crossbar addition (via get_k and right-aligned placement) may be over-specific or incorrect, as it depends on absolute s (row index) for c=2 and assumes fixed l=1.
 * Visited marking prevented overlaps successfully in training, but could miss horizontal multiples (only draws first bar per starting row).
 * find_bars, is_full, is_thin are essential and correct for extraction; draw_structure is core but crossbar logic (every-2 spacing from right) might be unnecessary or wrong if expected is full crossbar or no crossbar.
 * get_k is helpful for color-specific patterns but broken/not general (e.g., c=2 ties to s==1, which works for training's first structure but fails if c=2 appears later; untested for c>4 or l!=1).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the while loop in main only increments s by 1 even after drawing (though skips visited), which is inefficient but worked; no extraction of full objects beyond bars—could add a function to bundle entire structure data (e.g., height, leg count) for better validation.
 * Training 1-3 all correct, implying core detection/rendering matches expected for simple cases (likely single structures with 3 thin rows, standard colors 1-3, l=1).
 * No known mismatches in training, but subtle: if training had no crossbars needed or minimal k, it passed; potential issue if training avoided c=4 or varying s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output rendered four stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23, 0-indexed) separated by all-background rows, with remaining bottom rows all-background (27 rows total); each has full top/bottom bars cols 1-11, legs at cols 1/11 in 3 thin rows each, and color-specific crossbars in middle thin row (row 3 for 2: col 11 only; row 9 for 4: cols 7,9,11; row 15 for 3: cols 9,11; row 21 for 1: cols 7,9,11).
 * Observed effects: Crossbars add extra c cells in middle thin row (e.g., for 4, row 9 has c at 1(leg),7,9,11(leg+overlap), turning a thin row into partial fill; similar dotted right-aligned for others); legs match presumed input thin positions (3 per structure), not vertically filled; no overlaps or misses, all structures detected/drawn.
 * Differences from expected: Without the actual test input/expected output, hard to confirm, but the output does not look fully correct—crossbars create uneven, dotted patterns (e.g., 4's row 9 has isolated 4's at 7/9, resembling incomplete digit but overwriting thin intent; spacing every-2 from right feels arbitrary and may not match puzzle rules for "completion"); if expected is full rectangles or vertical leg fills, this partially matches (bars/legs) but adds unrequested dotted crossbars; if no crossbars needed, this over-draws; looks like digit attempts (2/4/3/1) but 4 appears malformed (right-heavy dots vs. standard left-vertical + full cross); bottom empty rows preserved, which is fine but unprocessed. Overall, detection worked (4 structures found), but rendering (esp. crossbars) likely incorrect, as patterns don't form clean shapes and depend on fragile get_k/s assumptions.
 * The test output makes partial sense (captures structures cleanly except crossbars) but not fully correct—crossbar additions alter thin rows unexpectedly, and right-aligned every-2 may be a misinterpretation (e.g., perhaps crossbars should be full, left-aligned, or absent; or k based on num_thin instead of c/s/l); accounts for multiple stacked but assumes fixed width/positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (8) and incomplete table-like structures in different colors (1, 2, 3, 4), where each structure consists of a top horizontal bar of 11 consecutive cells, at least 3 vertical legs (pairs of colored cells at the ends with background in between), an optional bottom bar, and a crossbar that needs to be completed in the middle leg row. The program's task is to detect these structures in the input grid and output a new grid with the structures fully drawn, including adding the color-specific crossbar segments on the right side of the middle leg, while filling the rest with background and avoiding overlaps via a visited mechanism.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures must start with exactly 11 consecutive cells of color c != background in a row, checked via is_full; shorter or longer bars are ignored.
 * Legs are detected downward from the top bar, requiring exactly two c cells at positions l and l+10 with all background (bg) strictly between (l+1 to l+9); if any non-bg appears between, it's not a valid leg (this ensures input legs are "clean" without premature crossbars).
 * At least 3 consecutive valid legs are required to process a structure; fewer are skipped.
 * Bottom bar is preferably detected as a full 11-cell bar exactly one row below the last leg (s + num_leg + 1); if not present or out of bounds, default to s + 4 (though not used in this test).
 * Crossbar is always drawn in the middle leg row (s + 1 + (num_leg // 2)), starting with the leg endpoints (l and l+10), then adding k-1 additional cells inward from the right endpoint at even steps (l+10 - 2*p for p=0 to k-1), creating a right-aligned "cross" pattern (e.g., for k=3: cells at l+10, l+8, l+6; left leg at l remains isolated).
 * Crossbar width k is color- and position-dependent via get_k: c=1 uses 4 - l (e.g., 3 for l=1, adding cells at positions 11,9,7 relative to l=1); c=2 uses 1 if starting row s==1 (minimal, no extras) else 2; c>=3 uses c//2 + 1 (e.g., 2 for c=3 adding at 11,9; 3 for c=4 adding at 11,9,7).
 * All drawing overwrites to c only for top/bottom (full 11 cells), legs (just endpoints), and crossbar (endpoints + extras); the output grid starts as all bg, so it reconstructs structures without copying extraneous input cells.
 * Process rows from top to bottom (s loop), skipping visited rows to prevent reprocessing overlaps; marks all rows from top to bottom (inclusive) as visited after drawing.
 * Subtlety: get_k's special case for c=2 depending on s==1 assumes position-specific rules (e.g., topmost structure gets minimal cross); this works for training but may fail if 2 appears elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: Structures are exactly 11 cells wide (l to l+10), starting at various l but fixed width; no rotation, vertical, or irregular shapes.
 * Subtlety: Input may have "clean" legs (bg between) but the program adds the crossbar, implying the puzzle is to complete/infer the cross; if input already has cross-like non-bg between legs, detection fails (is_leg returns False), skipping the structure.
 * All structures in test start at l=1, but code handles general l; background uniform from g[0][0].
 * No handling for isolated bars, fewer than 3 legs, or non-horizontal elements; assumes no overlapping structures (visited prevents but may miss interleaved ones).
 * Grid size: n rows, m=23 columns in test; l < m-10 to fit 11 cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color, essential for distinguishing structures and checking legs.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    return all(row[k] == c for k in range(l, l + 10))  # Note: range(l, l+11) would be correct for 11 cells; current is l to l+9 (10 cells)—potential off-by-one bug, but works if input matches.
```
(Checks for full horizontal bar of exactly 11 cells; critical for tops/bottoms; subtle off-by-one in range may cause issues for edge cases.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, c: int, bg: int, m: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or l + 10 >= m:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[l + 10] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, l + 10):  # Checks l+1 to l+9 (9 cells); assumes input has bg here for valid leg.
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Key for detecting clean legs; strict bg requirement between endpoints ensures no premature crossbars in input.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes crossbar width; essential for color-specific completion; s-dependency for c=2 is position-aware but brittle if 2 moves.)

The main program function integrates these to detect, count legs, draw components, and mark visited rows; no types like classes needed, but could add a Structure dataclass for top/l/legs/bottom/k if refactoring.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it successfully passed all 3 training examples (CORRECT), indicating core detection of full bars, legs, and crossbar drawing works for those cases.
 * Likely handled training structures with clean legs and position-specific k values (e.g., c=2 at s=1 getting k=1).
 * Potential missed subtlety: range in is_full is to l+10 (10 cells), but 11 needed (should be l+11); may coincidentally work if inputs align but risks missing 1-cell shorts.
 * get_k's s==1 for c=2 assumes fixed positioning; if training had 2 only at top, it passed, but generalizes poorly.
 * Visited marking from s to bottom inclusive prevents overlaps effectively in vertical stacking (as in test).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_background, is_full, is_leg, get_k) are relevant and core to detection/drawing—no broken ones noted, though is_full range is subtly imprecise.
 * No extraction of full objects attempted; code processes inline without storing structures, which works but could miss if needing to validate post-draw.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct based on puzzle rules: it reconstructs 4 stacked structures (colors 2 at rows 1-5, 4 at 7-11, 3 at 13-17, 1 at 19-23) with tops/bottoms as full 11-cell bars (cols 1-11), legs as endpoints only (cols 1 and 11), and crossbars added only in middle leg rows with color-specific widths—no extras for c=2 (k=1, row 3: just cols 1/11), one extra for c=3 (k=2, row 15: cols 1/9/11), two extras for c=4 and c=1 (k=3, rows 9/21: cols 1/7/9/11), all on bg elsewhere with no overlaps.
 * Expected: Input likely had clean outlines (full tops/bottoms, legs with bg between, no crossbars), and program completed crosses correctly without copying input extras; output isolates right-aligned cross patterns (e.g., no full horizontal cross, just stepped right-side fills + left leg).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Crossbars are not symmetric/full (e.g., gap between left leg at col 1 and right cross starting at col 7/9/11); this matches code but may be a subtlety— if puzzle expects connected/full bars, it's incorrect (unknown without true output, but consistent with training success).
 * For c=2, no change beyond legs (correct per k=1 and s=1); for others, added cells (e.g., row 9 cols 7/9 filled from bg to 4) complete the pattern without over-drawing.
 * All rows between structures (e.g., 0/6/12/18/24-26) are pure bg (8), and post-23 rows untouched; no artifacts or skips.
 * Overall, output demonstrates understanding: detects all 4 structures (num_leg=3 each), draws precisely, handles varying k; looks correct assuming puzzle goal is right-aligned cross completion.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

[2025-10-02 06:23:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern recognition and reconstruction, where the input grid contains partial or stylized representations of "ladder-like" structures (horizontal bars connected by vertical legs), and the goal is to detect these patterns and output a cleaned or fully drawn version of the structures while preserving the background and ignoring noise or incomplete elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Structures consist of a top horizontal bar exactly 11 units long, followed by at least 3 consecutive "leg" rows (vertical supports only at the ends with background filling the space between), and a bottom full horizontal bar of the same length and color; fewer than 3 legs disqualifies the structure.
 * Background color is determined solely from the top-left cell (g[0][0]); all non-structure areas must remain background.
 * Legs must be strictly at the ends (positions l and r), with only background between them in those rows; any non-background intrusion between legs invalidates the leg row.
 * Middle horizontal elements in structures are drawn based on color-specific rules: for color 1, uses a formula involving left position (4 - l); for color 2, 1 or 2 segments depending on start row s; for higher colors, roughly half the color value plus 1, placed from the right end stepping left by 2 units.
 * Detection scans row-by-row from top, skipping visited rows; only processes the first valid structure per starting row to avoid overlaps.
 * Structures must not exceed grid height; drawing is clipped to grid bounds.
 * Subtle: Bar detection requires exactly length 11 and non-background color; partial or longer bars are ignored.
 * Subtle: After legs, the bottom row must be fully filled with the structure color from l to r; no gaps allowed.
 * Subtle: Visited marking covers the entire structure height (top to bottom inclusive) to prevent reprocessing overlapping or adjacent structures.
 * All training examples require exact matching of drawn structures to expected clean outputs; test cases may stack multiple structures vertically with varying colors (1-4) and middle patterns.
 * Easy to miss: Middle bar placement starts from the right (r) and steps left by 2, up to k segments; for some colors, k depends on additional params like s (start row).
 * Easy to miss: No diagonal or non-vertical connections; everything is axis-aligned.
 * Considerations: Grid may have empty or all-background rows between structures; program must handle variable heights but fixed width (implied ~23 from output).
 * Considerations: Colors 1-4 represent different structure types with unique middle densities; background 8 is neutral and dominates.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts background color reliably from top-left.)

```python
def find_bars(row: List[int], bg: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    res: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    i = 0
    while i < w - 10:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        c = row[i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        if length == 11:
            res.append((i, i + 10, c))
        i = j
    return res
```
(Scans for exact 11-length horizontal bars, ignoring background and shorter/longer runs; essential for structure detection.)

```python
def is_full(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if row[k] != c:
            return False
    return True
```
(Verifies a row is completely filled with color c from l to r; used for top/bottom bars.)

```python
def is_leg(row: List[int], l: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    if l < 0 or r >= w:
        return False
    if row[l] != c or row[r] != c:
        return False
    for k in range(l + 1, r):
        if row[k] != bg:
            return False
    return True
```
(Critically checks for leg rows: ends at c, strict background between; bounds-checked.)

```python
def get_k(c: int, l: int, s: int) -> int:
    if c == 1:
        return 4 - l
    if c == 2:
        return 1 if s == 1 else 2
    return c // 2 + 1
```
(Computes number of middle segments based on color, left pos l, and start row s; color-specific logic is key for varying densities.)

```python
def draw_structure(out: List[List[int]], s: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, leg_rows: List[int], bottom_row: int, mid_row: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    if s + 4 >= h or bottom_row >= h:
        return
    for j in range(l, r + 1):
        if 0 <= s < h and 0 <= j < w:
            out[s][j] = c
        if 0 <= bottom_row < h and 0 <= j < w:
            out[bottom_row][j] = c
    for tr in leg_rows:
        if 0 <= tr < h:
            if 0 <= l < w:
                out[tr][l] = c
            if 0 <= r < w:
                out[tr][r] = c
    k = get_k(c, l, s)
    pos = r
    count = 0
    while count < k and pos >= l and 0 <= mid_row < h and 0 <= pos < w:
        out[mid_row][pos] = c
        pos -= 2
        count += 1
```
(Core drawing function; fills top/bottom bars fully, legs at ends only, and middle bar segments from right; clips to bounds. Highly useful but assumes mid_row is set correctly.)

```python
def mark_visited(visited: List[bool], start: int, end: int, h: int) -> None:
    for rr in range(start, min(end + 1, h)):
        visited[rr] = True
```
(Tracks processed rows to skip re-detection; prevents overlap issues.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; no prior iterations shown, but it successfully handles structure detection and drawing for all three training examples.
 * The bar-finding logic correctly identifies exact 11-unit runs, which worked for training but may miss if test input has varying bar lengths (though output suggests fixed).
 * Leg detection with strict background-between rule passed training; no known misses, but could fail if input has subtle noise between legs.
 * Middle bar drawing via get_k and stepping logic worked for training colors; test output shows color-specific variations (e.g., more segments for higher colors), which aligns.
 * Visited marking ensures vertical stacking without overlap, essential for multi-structure grids like the test.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though get_k has color-specific hacks (e.g., for c=2 depending on s==1) that might need generalization if more colors appear.
 * draw_structure assumes at least 4 rows total (s+4 < h check), which worked for training but could clip short structures in test (output shows full draws, so okay).
 * Overall, no major misses in this attempt; training success indicates core logic is sound.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense and appears correct: it reconstructs four vertically stacked ladder structures (for colors 2, 4, 3, 1) on background 8, each with top bar (full 11 units at cols 1-11), 3 leg rows (supports at cols 1 and 11, background between), bottom bar (full), and color-specific middle bars (e.g., color 4 in row 9 has segments at cols 1,7,9,11; color 3 in row 15 at 1,9,11; color 1 similar to others).
 * Structures are separated by all-background rows (e.g., row 6, 12, 18, 24-26), matching expected isolation.
 * No extraneous draws or overlaps; width ~23, with structures left-aligned starting col 1.
 * Middle bars vary correctly: denser for higher colors (e.g., color 4 has 4 segments, color 2 has 2), stepping left from right end by 2, as per get_k and draw logic.
 * Bottom rows (24-26) are pure background, indicating no trailing structures.
 * Output matches expected reconstruction: input likely had partial/noisy versions, and program cleaned/drew fully; no visible errors like missing legs or wrong colors.
