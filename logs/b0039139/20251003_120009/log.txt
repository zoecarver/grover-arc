=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 12:00:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:23:49] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where the program must detect consecutive solid blocks (runs of identical values >1, length >=3) in either vertical or horizontal orientation (chosen based on grid dimensions), extract the two largest such blocks' lengths and colors, and generate a new output grid that recombines or patterns elements from these blocks in a specific structural way, such as stacked full-color rows/columns or mixed patterns with positional rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Orientation decision: Treat as vertical if height > width (focus on row-wise blocks), else horizontal (focus on column-wise blocks); this determines the output shape and filling strategy.
 * Block extraction rules: Ignore blocks with varying values, or uniform 0 or 1; only consider uniform blocks of length >=3; use the last two qualifying blocks (largest by position, not necessarily size) for lengths (aa, bb) and colors (c1, c2).
 * Vertical case subtleties: Output is tall and narrow (height = aa + bb - 2, width=2); build sequence of 'full_c1', 'mixed' (alternating c1/c2), and 'full_c2' segments with specific counts (e.g., full_c1_nn = aa-2, split unevenly for left/right wrapping?); this creates a stacked pattern but can fail if mixing logic doesn't vary per row correctly.
 * Horizontal case subtleties: Output height = original height -2 (kk), width expands to 4*kk -1; positions for full_c1 and full_c2 columns are calculated differently based on kk parity (e.g., full_c1_pos shifts by 1 or 2); mixed columns use a get_mixed_pattern function that applies cyclic or edge-based rules (e.g., for kk=4, specific 4-element patterns based on jj %4, but defaults to edges c1 and middle c2 for other kk); full_c1_nn depends on aa/bb comparison (min or 0 if equal).
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Patterns in mixed columns must vary by row (ii) position, not be uniform; parity of kk affects positioning (odd: offset 1, even: offset 0 or 2); output must fill entire new dimensions without zeros; blocks are positionally ordered, so "last two" means the final two in scan order, not globally largest.
 * General considerations: Empty grid returns empty; assume rectangular input; colors c1/c2 from block values; potential wrapping or balancing in vertical (e.g., left_nn = (full_c1_nn +1)//2, right_nn balance) suggests asymmetry; failed cases often stem from uniform filling instead of per-position patterning.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    # Generates per-row pattern for mixed columns in horizontal case.
    # For kk==4, uses modulo-4 cycles with specific 4-element templates (e.g., o=0: [c1,c1,c1,c2]).
    # For other kk, defaults to c1 on edges (ii<1 or ii>kk-2), c2 in middle— this may be incomplete/broken for non-4 kk.
    if kk == 4:
        o = jj % 4
        if o == 0:
            return [c1, c1, c1, c2]

    else:
        return [c1 if (ii < 1 or ii > kk - 2) else c2 for ii in range(kk)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1-3, likely due to accurate block extraction and basic patterning for simpler cases (e.g., vertical stacking or horizontal with matching kk=4 modulo rules).
 * Failed training example 4: Generated uniform rows [2,2,2,8,2,2,2] for both output rows, but expected first row matching and second row alternating [2,8,2,8,2,8,2]; this suggests the vertical case's 'mixed' row filling is broken— it outputs [c1,c2] uniformly instead of varying the pattern across columns or applying per-position logic.
 * Block detection via get_blocks works well for identifying last two blocks in scan order, but assumes at least two exist (no error handling noted, could fail if <2).
 * Horizontal case positioning (full_c1_pos, full_c2_pos based on parity and min(aa,bb)) passed trainings but may not generalize; get_mixed_pattern is helpful but hardcoded for kk=4 and simplistic default, potentially missing cyclic or position-based subtleties for other kk.
 * Vertical output construction (types list with left/right balancing) is creative but unhelpful/incomplete— the split (left_nn = (full_c1_nn +1)//2) leads to asymmetric wrapping that doesn't produce row-varying patterns, causing uniform outputs.
 * Overall, core block extraction is solid and essential; patterning logic (especially mixing) needs refinement to handle alternation or cycles properly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted beyond the flawed vertical row generation in program(); get_blocks is relevant and should be retained/expanded.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x2 grid (vertical orientation assumed, height=10 > width=2) with blocks of [8,8] at top (2 rows), then [8,7] (1 row), [7,7] (5 rows), [8,8] (2 rows), and [8,7] (1 row? but listed as 10 lines total)— this appears to be attempting vertical block stacking but is incorrect because it mixes colors within rows ([8,7]) instead of full uniform rows/columns, and doesn't match the expected transformation rules (e.g., should derive from last two blocks like top 8-block and bottom 7-block, producing a recombined pattern like expanded mixed columns, not this hybrid).
 * It does not look correct: The output has inconsistent block lengths (e.g., 7's run 5 rows but interspersed with 8's), violating the >=3 uniform rule in reverse; likely a failure in vertical case to create proper full_c1/full_c2/mixed segments, resulting in partial overlaps or wrong counts (e.g., aa/bb miscalculated from input blocks of 8's and 7's).
 * Subtleties missed: Test input probably has vertical blocks of 8 (e.g., rows 1-2 and 8-9) and 7 (rows 4-8?), so last two should be a 5-length 7 and prior 2-length 8 (but 2<3, so maybe scans differently)—output should be height= (lengths sum -2), width=2, with patterned rows, not this near-uniform but flawed stacking; doesn't account for ignoring short blocks properly.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:35:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integers to identify structural elements like vertical separators (full columns of 1s), pattern sections, marker rows (containing 4s), and color values (A and B from the top row in later blocks), then generating a new output grid by extracting and repeating transformed units from the first section based on those markers and colors, with support for transposed input grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids may be transposed (more rows than columns), requiring rotation via zip(*g) to normalize orientation before processing and after output generation.
 * Separators are strictly vertical columns where every cell is exactly 1, dividing the grid into sections; the first section starts at column 0 and ends before the first separator.
 * The first section's width s determines the unit length (u = s - 1, excluding the first column), and only rows containing at least one 4 in this section are selected as "four_rows" for output, setting h_out as the count of such rows.
 * Colors A and B are extracted from the top row (row 0) in the second and third blocks (after the second and third separators, respectively), defaulting to 0 if out of bounds; these replace values in the unit (A for positions where original subrow == 4, else B), but only for columns 1 to s-1.
 * Output rows are built by repeating the unit (h_out - 1) full times, then appending a prefix of the unit truncated to (u - 1) length; if u <= 0, the row is empty.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return []), no separators (first section spans entire width, but u= w-1 if w>0), fewer than 3 separators (A and B default to 0), or no four_rows (h_out=0, empty output).
 * Subtlety: The transformation ignores the first column of the first section entirely in unit building, and the output width is h_out * u - 1 (accounting for overlaps in repetition), which can lead to irregular shapes if h_out or u is small.
 * Repetition logic assumes a tiled or extended pattern, but may over-repeat or truncate if h_out >1 and u >1, potentially creating periodic outputs that don't match non-repetitive expected puzzles.
 * Transposition must be reversed on output to preserve original orientation, and all functions assume rectangular grids (consistent row lengths).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transposes the grid if needed; useful for handling vertical vs horizontal layouts."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```

```python
def get_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Identifies column indices that are full vertical separators (all 1s)."""
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    seps = []
    for c in range(w):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(h)):
            seps.append(c)
    return seps
```

```python
def get_first_section_start_end(seps: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Gets the start (always 0) and end (before first sep or full width) of the first section."""
    if not seps:
        return 0, len(g[0]) if g else 0  # Note: assumes g available; adjust as needed
    return 0, seps[0]
```

```python
def get_block_colors(g: List[List[int]], h: int, seps: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Extracts A and B from top row in second and third blocks; defaults to 0 if invalid."""
    if len(seps) < 3 or h == 0:
        return 0, 0
    block1_start = seps[1] + 1
    A = 0
    if block1_start < len(g[0]) and h > 0:
        A = g[0][block1_start]
    block2_start = seps[2] + 1
    B = 0
    if block2_start < len(g[0]) and h > 0:
        B = g[0][block2_start]
    return A, B
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all four training examples, correctly identifying separators, four_rows, and building repeated units with A/B replacements to produce matching outputs.
 * Worked well for cases with exactly 3+ separators, non-transposed grids, and first sections containing 4s in select rows, demonstrating core understanding of section division and pattern extraction.
 * The build_unit function effectively transforms subrows by ignoring the first column and mapping 4s to A (else B), which aligned with training expectations.
 * get_four_rows correctly selected only rows with 4s in the first section, limiting h_out to relevant markers.
 * build_output_row's repetition logic (full repeats + prefix) worked for training, but may assume a specific tiling that doesn't generalize.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one missed handling cases where seps <3 gracefully beyond defaulting A/B=0, potentially causing empty or zero-filled outputs in sparse grids.
 * Transposition handling is essential and worked, but could fail if input has uneven rows (though assumes rectangular).
 * Function get_separators is helpful and correct for identifying dividers.
 * Function get_block_colors is relevant but brittle if blocks are empty or top row lacks values; consider fallbacks.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (e.g., transpose, get_first_section_start_end) contribute to the pipeline.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 20 rows (last incomplete), forming a repeating 5-row pattern of 8s and 7s: rows like [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], [8,8,7,8,8], repeated 4 times with truncation.
 * This repetitive structure suggests the program detected h_out=5 (five four_rows), u=4 (s=5, first section width 5), A=8, B=7, and applied the repetition (5-1=4 full units + prefix of 3), but tiled across h_out times, creating a periodic block that expands vertically and horizontally.
 * The output does not look correct because it appears artificially tiled/repeated without variation, which may indicate over-application of the repetition logic for this test input's structure (e.g., if test has more separators or different four_rows placement, it should produce a non-periodic or differently scaled grid); the exact expected test output is unknown, but this uniformity differs from likely puzzle goals of unique pattern extension.
 * Horizontal width is consistently 5 per base unit but expands via repetition (e.g., 4*4 -1 =15? but shown as 5, suggesting u=5 mismatch or prefix error), indicating a potential calculation bug in w_out or build_output_row for this input.
 * Vertical repetition (4 full blocks of 5 rows) implies h_out=5 and multiple cycles, but truncation at row 20 suggests incomplete handling of large h_out or output bounds, making it seem incorrect for a puzzle expecting a compact or precisely shaped result.
