=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:23:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 18:36:34] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 18:50:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g[0]), len(g)  # (w, h)
```

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]
```

```python
def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w, h = len(g[0]), len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h))]
```

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([row[start:sep] for row in g])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([row[start:] for row in g])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

```python
def get_filled_pos(panel: List[List[int]], slice_idx: int, fill_value: int, is_vertical: bool, panel_main: int) -> List[int]:
    filled_pos = []
    if is_vertical:
        for r in range(panel_main):
            if panel[r][slice_idx] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(r)
    else:
        for j in range(panel_main):
            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:50:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g[0]), len(g)  # (w, h)
```

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]
```

```python
def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w, h = len(g[0]), len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h))]
```

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([row[start:sep] for row in g])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([row[start:] for row in g])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

```python
def get_filled_pos(panel: List[List[int]], slice_idx: int, fill_value: int, is_vertical: bool, panel_main: int) -> List[int]:
    filled_pos = []
    if is_vertical:
        for r in range(panel_main):
            if panel[r][slice_idx] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(r)
    else:
        for j in range(panel_main):
            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:01:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

[2025-09-30 19:01:08] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections between elements are consistent across **every** puzzle. These are limited to obvious, recurring patterns in properties (e.g., color, position via bbox, size via pixels) and components (e.g., shapes like small rectangles or large blocks) that demonstrably influence or relate to each other in the transformation from input to output. Only elements with clear, consistent interactions are included—isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., occasional vertical blues in train 2/3 that do not affect outputs uniformly, or varying yellow pixel counts without direct output impact) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are provided; unknown aspects (e.g., exact pixel redistribution mechanics) are noted as such.

1. **Green small rectangles (pixels=2, bbox height=2, horizontal alignment) ↔ Number and positioning of output segments**:
   - Greens always appear as small, paired or tripled horizontal rectangles (2–3 per row) in mid-y positions (e.g., y=1–2 or y=4–5 range).
   - Their count per input (e.g., 2 in train 1/4, 3 in train 2, 4 total in train 3 across rows) consistently correlates with the number of repeated segments in the output (e.g., 2–4 segments of primary colors in train 1/4, 3 large + 4 small in train 2, 4 of one color + 4 of another in train 3).
   - Interaction: Green positions (x-spacing within a section) influence output segment ordering (left-to-right or top-to-bottom in bbox), creating divisions or separators. No greens → no segmentation (but all inputs have them). Unknown: Exact mapping of green x-positions to output bbox offsets.

2. **Large bottom blocks (multi-pixel colors like Red/Maroon/Pink/Yellow/Light Blue, bbox height >3, full-width or near-full) ↔ Color propagation and segmentation in output**:
   - These occupy high-y positions (bottom of stack, e.g., y=10+ in train 1, y=0–6 in others) with large pixels (12–42).
   - Consistently, their colors are directly reused in output as the dominant repeated elements (e.g., Red/Light Blue in train 1 output, Maroon in train 2, Pink/Yellow in train 3, Red/Maroon in train 4), split into 2–4 smaller rectangles per input block.
   - Interaction: The block's color affects output color assignment, with segmentation triggered by green counts (see #1); multiple bottom blocks (e.g., train 1/3/4) lead to interleaved or adjacent color groups in output. Position (relative y-order) preserves sequence in output layout. Unknown: How input pixels (e.g., 16→6 total for Red in train 1) map to output pixel totals—consistent reduction but no clear formula.

3. **Blue bars (horizontal full-width rectangles, pixels=4–7, bbox width spanning 0 to max-x, height=1) ↔ Section separation influencing upper/lower component interactions**:
   - Blues appear as dividing lines (e.g., y=4/9/14 in train 1, y-spanning but section-bound in others) between upper patterns (yellow/greens) and lower blocks.
   - Consistently, their y-positions define "sections" that bound greens and large blocks, ensuring greens interact only within the section above a given blue bar.
   - Interaction: Blue positions gate the effect of upper elements (yellow/greens) on the immediate lower large block's color/segmentation (e.g., greens above a blue affect the block below it). Without blues, no clear sections (but all inputs have 2–4). Unknown: Blues do not appear in outputs, so their role ends at input structuring—no direct output bbox influence observed.

4. **Yellow top motif (small non-full rectangle, pixels=3–13, bbox starting at x=1 y=1, width=2–3) ↔ Color influence on output end-caps or small segments**:
   - Always at lowest y (top of structure), with irregular pixels suggesting non-solid shape (e.g., U-like as described).
   - Consistently reappears in output as small "cap" segments (pixels=1–3, e.g., single-pixel Yellows at edges in train 3, or influencing Light Blue small piece in train 1; Greens in train 2 may proxy similar role).
   - Interaction: Yellow's position (top-left) seeds small output elements at bbox edges (x=0 or x=max, y=3+), often alternating with large block colors. Its presence ensures output starts/ends with non-large-block colors if greens are present. Unknown: Why pixel count varies without direct output scaling—consistent positional seeding but variable size impact.

5. **Overall position (bbox y-order from low to high) ↔ Output layout normalization**:
   - Input elements follow vertical stacking (increasing y), with x varying by component.
   - Consistently, this orders interactions: top (yellow) → mid (greens, bounded by blues) → bottom (large blocks), mapping to output's linear arrangement (e.g., left-to-right x in train 2/3, top-to-bottom y in train 1/4).
   - Interaction: Y-position hierarchies enforce causal flow (e.g., greens' x affect only subsequent large block's split), with all outputs normalized to start at [0,0,...] regardless of input max-x/y. Unknown: Exact x-to-output scaling (e.g., input width 3–28 → output width 1–14), consistent reset but no uniform ratio.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no hole influences as all=0; no irrelevant elements like occasional merged greens in train 3 affect uniformly; test inputs not used for consistency check as they are not paired with outputs). These connections are structural only—transformations like pixel loss or precise bbox shifts remain unknown without solving.

[2025-09-30 19:03:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

            return []
        row = panel[slice_idx]
        return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 4]  # Similar issue; template positions seem implicit from structure, not hardcoded 4
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections between elements are consistent across **every** puzzle. These are limited to obvious, recurring patterns in properties (e.g., color, position via bbox, size via pixels) and components (e.g., shapes like small rectangles or large blocks) that demonstrably influence or relate to each other in the transformation from input to output. Only elements with clear, consistent interactions are included—isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., occasional vertical blues in train 2/3 that do not affect outputs uniformly, or varying yellow pixel counts without direct output impact) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are provided; unknown aspects (e.g., exact pixel redistribution mechanics) are noted as such.

1. **Green small rectangles (pixels=2, bbox height=2, horizontal alignment) ↔ Number and positioning of output segments**:
   - Greens always appear as small, paired or tripled horizontal rectangles (2–3 per row) in mid-y positions (e.g., y=1–2 or y=4–5 range).
   - Their count per input (e.g., 2 in train 1/4, 3 in train 2, 4 total in train 3 across rows) consistently correlates with the number of repeated segments in the output (e.g., 2–4 segments of primary colors in train 1/4, 3 large + 4 small in train 2, 4 of one color + 4 of another in train 3).
   - Interaction: Green positions (x-spacing within a section) influence output segment ordering (left-to-right or top-to-bottom in bbox), creating divisions or separators. No greens → no segmentation (but all inputs have them). Unknown: Exact mapping of green x-positions to output bbox offsets.

2. **Large bottom blocks (multi-pixel colors like Red/Maroon/Pink/Yellow/Light Blue, bbox height >3, full-width or near-full) ↔ Color propagation and segmentation in output**:
   - These occupy high-y positions (bottom of stack, e.g., y=10+ in train 1, y=0–6 in others) with large pixels (12–42).
   - Consistently, their colors are directly reused in output as the dominant repeated elements (e.g., Red/Light Blue in train 1 output, Maroon in train 2, Pink/Yellow in train 3, Red/Maroon in train 4), split into 2–4 smaller rectangles per input block.
   - Interaction: The block's color affects output color assignment, with segmentation triggered by green counts (see #1); multiple bottom blocks (e.g., train 1/3/4) lead to interleaved or adjacent color groups in output. Position (relative y-order) preserves sequence in output layout. Unknown: How input pixels (e.g., 16→6 total for Red in train 1) map to output pixel totals—consistent reduction but no clear formula.

3. **Blue bars (horizontal full-width rectangles, pixels=4–7, bbox width spanning 0 to max-x, height=1) ↔ Section separation influencing upper/lower component interactions**:
   - Blues appear as dividing lines (e.g., y=4/9/14 in train 1, y-spanning but section-bound in others) between upper patterns (yellow/greens) and lower blocks.
   - Consistently, their y-positions define "sections" that bound greens and large blocks, ensuring greens interact only within the section above a given blue bar.
   - Interaction: Blue positions gate the effect of upper elements (yellow/greens) on the immediate lower large block's color/segmentation (e.g., greens above a blue affect the block below it). Without blues, no clear sections (but all inputs have 2–4). Unknown: Blues do not appear in outputs, so their role ends at input structuring—no direct output bbox influence observed.

4. **Yellow top motif (small non-full rectangle, pixels=3–13, bbox starting at x=1 y=1, width=2–3) ↔ Color influence on output end-caps or small segments**:
   - Always at lowest y (top of structure), with irregular pixels suggesting non-solid shape (e.g., U-like as described).
   - Consistently reappears in output as small "cap" segments (pixels=1–3, e.g., single-pixel Yellows at edges in train 3, or influencing Light Blue small piece in train 1; Greens in train 2 may proxy similar role).
   - Interaction: Yellow's position (top-left) seeds small output elements at bbox edges (x=0 or x=max, y=3+), often alternating with large block colors. Its presence ensures output starts/ends with non-large-block colors if greens are present. Unknown: Why pixel count varies without direct output scaling—consistent positional seeding but variable size impact.

5. **Overall position (bbox y-order from low to high) ↔ Output layout normalization**:
   - Input elements follow vertical stacking (increasing y), with x varying by component.
   - Consistently, this orders interactions: top (yellow) → mid (greens, bounded by blues) → bottom (large blocks), mapping to output's linear arrangement (e.g., left-to-right x in train 2/3, top-to-bottom y in train 1/4).
   - Interaction: Y-position hierarchies enforce causal flow (e.g., greens' x affect only subsequent large block's split), with all outputs normalized to start at [0,0,...] regardless of input max-x/y. Unknown: Exact x-to-output scaling (e.g., input width 3–28 → output width 1–14), consistent reset but no uniform ratio.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no hole influences as all=0; no irrelevant elements like occasional merged greens in train 3 affect uniformly; test inputs not used for consistency check as they are not paired with outputs). These connections are structural only—transformations like pixel loss or precise bbox shifts remain unknown without solving.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 19:17:21] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

Prompt: Succinctly describe all elements in this visual puzzle as one bullet list, generalized over both input and output.
Input image: logs/b0039139/20250930_182346/test_0_input.png
Output image: logs/b0039139/20250930_182346/train_0_output.png

[2025-09-30 19:17:47] Response:
- **Vertical stack structure**: Both images feature tall, columnar compositions built from layered horizontal bands or blocks of solid colors (e.g., black, blue, green, maroon, purple, red), suggesting a totem-like or pixelated tower.
- **Color blocks**: Uniform rectangular sections in primary/secondary hues (yellow, green, blue, purple, maroon/red) fill widths variably, with some full-width (e.g., solid purple base) and others partial or segmented.
- **Emblem/symbol**: Top section includes a stylized yellow icon on black (resembling a face, letter, or glyph with curved lines and protrusions) in the input; absent in output.
- **Horizontal dividers**: Thin blue lines or bars separate stacked color layers in input; implied by block boundaries in output.
- **Pixelated patterns**: Input has clustered green squares (e.g., 2-3 in offset rows on black) suggesting foliage or buttons; output uses indented L-shapes or steps in red with embedded blue rectangles, forming asymmetric protrusions.
- **Asymmetry and indentation**: Output emphasizes stepped or notched edges (e.g., blue blocks offset rightward within red layers), creating a staircase effect; input is more symmetric with centered elements.
- **Layering hierarchy**: From top to bottom: emblem/crown (input), mid-bands of contrasting colors, base solid color; both maintain vertical alignment without rotation or overlap.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Vertical stack structure**: Both images feature tall, columnar compositions built from layered horizontal bands or blocks of solid colors (e.g., black, blue, green, maroon, purple, red), suggesting a totem-like or pixelated tower.
- **Color blocks**: Uniform rectangular sections in primary/secondary hues (yellow, green, blue, purple, maroon/red) fill widths variably, with some full-width (e.g., solid purple base) and others partial or segmented.
- **Emblem/symbol**: Top section includes a stylized yellow icon on black (resembling a face, letter, or glyph with curved lines and protrusions) in the input; absent in output.
- **Horizontal dividers**: Thin blue lines or bars separate stacked color layers in input; implied by block boundaries in output.
- **Pixelated patterns**: Input has clustered green squares (e.g., 2-3 in offset rows on black) suggesting foliage or buttons; output uses indented L-shapes or steps in red with embedded blue rectangles, forming asymmetric protrusions.
- **Asymmetry and indentation**: Output emphasizes stepped or notched edges (e.g., blue blocks offset rightward within red layers), creating a staircase effect; input is more symmetric with centered elements.
- **Layering hierarchy**: From top to bottom: emblem/crown (input), mid-bands of contrasting colors, base solid color; both maintain vertical alignment without rotation or overlap.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between properties/components across **every** example. These are limited to patterns that appear without exception, focusing on properties like position, color, size (pixels/bbox), and shape (all holes=0). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., varying widths, emblem-like Yellow shapes, or non-recurring colors like Orange/Dark Red in tests) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are included. Transformations (e.g., how input patterns exactly produce output steps/indents) are called out as unknown where not obviously connected.

- **Y-position <-> Layering hierarchy**: Components' min-y and max-y values consistently determine vertical stacking order, with lower min-y components forming upper layers and higher min-y forming lower/base layers. This interaction creates non-overlapping horizontal bands in both inputs and outputs, without rotation.
  
- **Color <-> Adjacency in y-position**: Prominent colors (e.g., Blue in inputs, Red/Maroon/Pink in outputs) consistently interact with adjacent components via y-overlap or boundary sharing, defining layer boundaries. Blue in inputs always neighbors large blocks (e.g., Red/Maroon/Pink/Yellow) in y, separating them; in outputs, alternating colors (e.g., Red-Light Blue, Maroon-Green) share y-boundaries to form stacked bands.

- **Pixel count <-> Bbox dimensions**: For every component, pixel count directly scales with bbox area (width * height span), indicating solid fills (holes=0 reinforces this). This property consistently links size to spatial extent, with no exceptions (e.g., small pixels=2 always span 1x2 bbox for vertical pairs).

- **Green color <-> Small size and x-position clustering**: Green components (always pixels=2, vertical 1x2 bbox) consistently cluster in x-position within the same y-layer (e.g., paired or grouped at similar y), interacting with surrounding layers' colors (e.g., adjacent to Blue or large blocks). Their x-offsets (e.g., spaced evenly) show positional connection to layer width, but do not vary in holes or height.

- **Large block colors (high pixels, high y) <-> Output color selection**: Colors of input's largest components (pixels >15, max-y spans multiple units, e.g., Red/Maroon/Pink/Yellow at bottom) consistently propagate to output as the primary alternating colors, linking base-layer color to output palette without introducing new colors.

**Unknown connections**: Specific interactions like how Green x-positions or counts affect output indents/steps (e.g., asymmetry in bbox x-offsets) or how top Yellow pixels transform into output protrusions are not obviously consistent or explainable from positions/sizes alone— these appear variable and require deeper rule inference beyond provided data. No forced links (e.g., to semantic shapes or movement) are present.

[2025-09-30 19:19:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

            if panel[r][slice_idx] == fill_value:

    else:
        for j in range(panel_main):
            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between properties/components across **every** example. These are limited to patterns that appear without exception, focusing on properties like position, color, size (pixels/bbox), and shape (all holes=0). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., varying widths, emblem-like Yellow shapes, or non-recurring colors like Orange/Dark Red in tests) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are included. Transformations (e.g., how input patterns exactly produce output steps/indents) are called out as unknown where not obviously connected.

- **Y-position <-> Layering hierarchy**: Components' min-y and max-y values consistently determine vertical stacking order, with lower min-y components forming upper layers and higher min-y forming lower/base layers. This interaction creates non-overlapping horizontal bands in both inputs and outputs, without rotation.
  
- **Color <-> Adjacency in y-position**: Prominent colors (e.g., Blue in inputs, Red/Maroon/Pink in outputs) consistently interact with adjacent components via y-overlap or boundary sharing, defining layer boundaries. Blue in inputs always neighbors large blocks (e.g., Red/Maroon/Pink/Yellow) in y, separating them; in outputs, alternating colors (e.g., Red-Light Blue, Maroon-Green) share y-boundaries to form stacked bands.

- **Pixel count <-> Bbox dimensions**: For every component, pixel count directly scales with bbox area (width * height span), indicating solid fills (holes=0 reinforces this). This property consistently links size to spatial extent, with no exceptions (e.g., small pixels=2 always span 1x2 bbox for vertical pairs).

- **Green color <-> Small size and x-position clustering**: Green components (always pixels=2, vertical 1x2 bbox) consistently cluster in x-position within the same y-layer (e.g., paired or grouped at similar y), interacting with surrounding layers' colors (e.g., adjacent to Blue or large blocks). Their x-offsets (e.g., spaced evenly) show positional connection to layer width, but do not vary in holes or height.

- **Large block colors (high pixels, high y) <-> Output color selection**: Colors of input's largest components (pixels >15, max-y spans multiple units, e.g., Red/Maroon/Pink/Yellow at bottom) consistently propagate to output as the primary alternating colors, linking base-layer color to output palette without introducing new colors.

**Unknown connections**: Specific interactions like how Green x-positions or counts affect output indents/steps (e.g., asymmetry in bbox x-offsets) or how top Yellow pixels transform into output protrusions are not obviously consistent or explainable from positions/sizes alone— these appear variable and require deeper rule inference beyond provided data. No forced links (e.g., to semantic shapes or movement) are present.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:35:11] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([row[start:sep] for row in g])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([row[start:] for row in g])
    return panels
```

```python
def extract_panels(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w, h = get_dimensions(g)
    orientation = 'vertical' if h > w else 'horizontal'
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        seps = find_horizontal_separators(g)
        return get_panel_rows(g, seps)
    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)
```
(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

- **Vertical stack structure**: Both images feature tall, narrow compositions built from stacked colored rectangular blocks or pixels, primarily in primary colors (yellow, green, blue, red, purple, maroon) with black accents/outlines.
- **Layered horizontal bands**: Input uses distinct horizontal layers (e.g., yellow-black top, blue separators, green patterned mid, maroon and purple bases); output employs overlapping red and blue bands forming stepped or L-shaped protrusions.
- **Symmetrical patterns**: Input has centered symmetrical elements like green blocks in a row and uniform block heights; output shows mirrored blue extensions on red bases, creating balanced asymmetry.
- **Color dominance**: Input emphasizes cool tones (blue, green, purple) with warm accents (yellow, maroon); output focuses on warm red bases with contrasting blue highlights.
- **Geometric simplicity**: Both use basic squares/rectangles without curves or complex shapes, evoking pixel art or block-building styles (e.g., Minecraft-inspired).
- **Proportional scaling**: Elements maintain consistent widths (narrow column) but vary heights; input is more uniform stacking, output introduces offsets for depth/overlap.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 19:35:31] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all 4 train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case (e.g., one element's presence/position/color/properties directly influencing another's transformation, count, or placement). I focused solely on patterns that hold true without exception, using properties like color, position (bbox), count (of components), and size (pixels). No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are included. Irrelevant elements (e.g., the top Yellow block, which appears in all inputs but has no detectable interaction with outputs) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear interactions (e.g., exact pixel scaling ratios vary and cannot be explained consistently) are noted as unknown where they might relate but do not fully connect.

1. **Blue components as separators → Definition of base sections (positions and colors)**  
   - In every input, multiple Blue components (always holes=0, often horizontal or vertical bars with consistent width ~3-7 pixels spanning full section height) act as positional dividers, segmenting the composition into stacked or adjacent sections.  
   - This directly affects the identification of the two bottom-most non-Blue sections: the section immediately before the final Blue defines Color A (e.g., Red in Trains 1/4, Maroon in Train 2, Pink in Train 3), and the section after the final Blue defines Color B (e.g., Light Blue in Train 1, Green in Train 2, Yellow in Train 3, Maroon in Train 4).  
   - Interaction: Blue positions (y-coordinates increasing downward) isolate these base sections, enabling their colors and bboxes to propagate to the output without alteration to the color identity itself. No other sections' colors (e.g., upper Blues or Yellow) interact this way.

2. **Small Green components (non-base) count → Number of Color A blocks in output**  
   - In every input, small Green components (holes=0, pixels=2 each, compact bboxes like 1x2 vertical or 2x1 horizontal, positioned in mid-sections between early Blues, not part of the bottom base) are consistently counted as N (N=2 in Trains 1/4, N=3 in Train 2, N=4 in Train 3). These are distinct from any large base Green (which, if present, is treated as Color B instead).  
   - This count directly determines the number of Color A blocks in the output (always exactly N blocks of Color A, matching the input base Color A).  
   - Interaction: The count of these Greens affects the replication/segmentation of Color A; their positions (e.g., clustered at specific x like 7/9/11) do not directly map but ensure consistent multiplicity (e.g., more Greens → more A blocks spaced horizontally). If no small Greens were present, this would imply N=0, but all examples have them.

3. **Color A and Color B → Alternating block structure in output**  
   - The colors from the base sections (Color A before final Blue, Color B after) are the only colors used in every output (no other input colors appear).  
   - This results in an alternating horizontal arrangement: N Color A blocks interleaved with (N-1) Color B blocks, always framed by 2 small Color B elements (one at each horizontal end).  
   - Interaction: Color A and B mutually define the pattern—Color A provides the "backbone" blocks (larger, base-level y=0), while Color B provides the "connectors" (between A blocks as medium size, at ends as minimal size). This holds even when Color B is Green (Train 2), where base Green is reclassified from "small Green count" to Color B.

4. **Position offsets between Color A and Color B blocks → Spatial transformation (adjacency/overlap)**  
   - In every output, Color A blocks (horizontal bboxes starting at y=0, widths ~2-3 units) are placed with consistent rightward offsets relative to Color B blocks (e.g., A at x=0-2, B shifted to x=1-4 or x=2-4; exact shifts vary but always partial overlap or direct adjacency without gaps >1 unit).  
   - Color B end elements are positioned at extreme x (leftmost/rightmost, often at higher y like y=3-4 for tops).  
   - Interaction: A-block positions affect B-block placement (B "wraps" or protrudes from A edges, creating consistent stepped connections); this transforms the input's vertical stacking (high y-spans) into output's horizontal extension (increasing x-span). Between-B blocks are always larger than end-B (pixels ~5-9 vs. ~1-3), but exact sizing relative to input base pixels is unknown (ratios inconsistent, e.g., ~1/3 in Train 2 vs. ~1/4 in Train 1).

5. **Holes property (always 0) → No effect on connectivity (neutral across all)**  
   - Every component in all inputs and outputs has holes=0, which consistently allows full rectangular connectivity without interruptions (e.g., no enclosed voids affecting bbox merging or pixel flow between A and B).  
   - Interaction: This property enables seamless adjacency/overlap between A and B without fragmentation; if holes>0 appeared, it might disrupt, but it is invariant and supports all other spatial interactions.

### Notes on Unknowns/Limitations
- **Pixel counts for block sizing**: Input base pixels (e.g., ~16-42 for A/B) loosely influence output block sizes (e.g., divided roughly by N), but the transformation is not consistent (e.g., Train 2 preserves ~1/3 ratio, Train 3 ~1/4 for one color but not the other). Cannot explain exact mechanism—marked as unknown rather than forced connection.
- **Vertical vs. horizontal orientation**: All inputs use vertical progression (increasing y for stacking), affecting section isolation by Blues, but outputs shift to horizontal (increasing x for alternation). The trigger for this reorientation is unknown (possibly implicit in Green count or base colors, but not directly observable).
- **Upper input elements (e.g., initial Yellow, early Blues/Greens positions)**: These interact only indirectly via enabling Green placement (e.g., early Blues bound Green sections), but do not propagate to output colors or counts—excluded as irrelevant to consistent transformations.
- No forced connections: For example, Green x-positions (e.g., clustered around x=7-11) do not consistently map to output x-offsets (varies by train); semantic meanings like "patterns" or "movement" cannot be identified from bbox/pixels alone without assuming unprovided visuals.

This list captures only the evident, universal interconnections; no broader synthesis or test application is attempted.

[2025-09-30 19:37:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

    if orientation == 'vertical':
        seps = find_horizontal_separators(g)
        return get_panel_rows(g, seps)
    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)
```
(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all 4 train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case (e.g., one element's presence/position/color/properties directly influencing another's transformation, count, or placement). I focused solely on patterns that hold true without exception, using properties like color, position (bbox), count (of components), and size (pixels). No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are included. Irrelevant elements (e.g., the top Yellow block, which appears in all inputs but has no detectable interaction with outputs) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear interactions (e.g., exact pixel scaling ratios vary and cannot be explained consistently) are noted as unknown where they might relate but do not fully connect.

1. **Blue components as separators → Definition of base sections (positions and colors)**  
   - In every input, multiple Blue components (always holes=0, often horizontal or vertical bars with consistent width ~3-7 pixels spanning full section height) act as positional dividers, segmenting the composition into stacked or adjacent sections.  
   - This directly affects the identification of the two bottom-most non-Blue sections: the section immediately before the final Blue defines Color A (e.g., Red in Trains 1/4, Maroon in Train 2, Pink in Train 3), and the section after the final Blue defines Color B (e.g., Light Blue in Train 1, Green in Train 2, Yellow in Train 3, Maroon in Train 4).  
   - Interaction: Blue positions (y-coordinates increasing downward) isolate these base sections, enabling their colors and bboxes to propagate to the output without alteration to the color identity itself. No other sections' colors (e.g., upper Blues or Yellow) interact this way.

2. **Small Green components (non-base) count → Number of Color A blocks in output**  
   - In every input, small Green components (holes=0, pixels=2 each, compact bboxes like 1x2 vertical or 2x1 horizontal, positioned in mid-sections between early Blues, not part of the bottom base) are consistently counted as N (N=2 in Trains 1/4, N=3 in Train 2, N=4 in Train 3). These are distinct from any large base Green (which, if present, is treated as Color B instead).  
   - This count directly determines the number of Color A blocks in the output (always exactly N blocks of Color A, matching the input base Color A).  
   - Interaction: The count of these Greens affects the replication/segmentation of Color A; their positions (e.g., clustered at specific x like 7/9/11) do not directly map but ensure consistent multiplicity (e.g., more Greens → more A blocks spaced horizontally). If no small Greens were present, this would imply N=0, but all examples have them.

3. **Color A and Color B → Alternating block structure in output**  
   - The colors from the base sections (Color A before final Blue, Color B after) are the only colors used in every output (no other input colors appear).  
   - This results in an alternating horizontal arrangement: N Color A blocks interleaved with (N-1) Color B blocks, always framed by 2 small Color B elements (one at each horizontal end).  
   - Interaction: Color A and B mutually define the pattern—Color A provides the "backbone" blocks (larger, base-level y=0), while Color B provides the "connectors" (between A blocks as medium size, at ends as minimal size). This holds even when Color B is Green (Train 2), where base Green is reclassified from "small Green count" to Color B.

4. **Position offsets between Color A and Color B blocks → Spatial transformation (adjacency/overlap)**  
   - In every output, Color A blocks (horizontal bboxes starting at y=0, widths ~2-3 units) are placed with consistent rightward offsets relative to Color B blocks (e.g., A at x=0-2, B shifted to x=1-4 or x=2-4; exact shifts vary but always partial overlap or direct adjacency without gaps >1 unit).  
   - Color B end elements are positioned at extreme x (leftmost/rightmost, often at higher y like y=3-4 for tops).  
   - Interaction: A-block positions affect B-block placement (B "wraps" or protrudes from A edges, creating consistent stepped connections); this transforms the input's vertical stacking (high y-spans) into output's horizontal extension (increasing x-span). Between-B blocks are always larger than end-B (pixels ~5-9 vs. ~1-3), but exact sizing relative to input base pixels is unknown (ratios inconsistent, e.g., ~1/3 in Train 2 vs. ~1/4 in Train 1).

5. **Holes property (always 0) → No effect on connectivity (neutral across all)**  
   - Every component in all inputs and outputs has holes=0, which consistently allows full rectangular connectivity without interruptions (e.g., no enclosed voids affecting bbox merging or pixel flow between A and B).  
   - Interaction: This property enables seamless adjacency/overlap between A and B without fragmentation; if holes>0 appeared, it might disrupt, but it is invariant and supports all other spatial interactions.

### Notes on Unknowns/Limitations
- **Pixel counts for block sizing**: Input base pixels (e.g., ~16-42 for A/B) loosely influence output block sizes (e.g., divided roughly by N), but the transformation is not consistent (e.g., Train 2 preserves ~1/3 ratio, Train 3 ~1/4 for one color but not the other). Cannot explain exact mechanism—marked as unknown rather than forced connection.
- **Vertical vs. horizontal orientation**: All inputs use vertical progression (increasing y for stacking), affecting section isolation by Blues, but outputs shift to horizontal (increasing x for alternation). The trigger for this reorientation is unknown (possibly implicit in Green count or base colors, but not directly observable).
- **Upper input elements (e.g., initial Yellow, early Blues/Greens positions)**: These interact only indirectly via enabling Green placement (e.g., early Blues bound Green sections), but do not propagate to output colors or counts—excluded as irrelevant to consistent transformations.
- No forced connections: For example, Green x-positions (e.g., clustered around x=7-11) do not consistently map to output x-offsets (varies by train); semantic meanings like "patterns" or "movement" cannot be identified from bbox/pixels alone without assuming unprovided visuals.

This list captures only the evident, universal interconnections; no broader synthesis or test application is attempted.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 19:50:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract a motif, the second-to-last panel providing the background color, and the last panel providing the accent color. The output is a generated pattern that weaves or repeats the motif from the template (replacing 0s with accent and others with background) into a larger grid, with orientation (vertical or horizontal) determined by whether height exceeds width, leading to row- or column-based panel splitting and motif application.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are split excluding the separator lines themselves (start after previous sep, end before next), but must result in at least 4 panels (template + at least two more for bg/acc) or output empty list.
 * Orientation check (h > w for vertical) dictates separator type: horizontal seps for vertical orientation (splitting rows), vertical seps for horizontal (splitting columns); this affects how the motif is extracted and woven.
 * Template motif extraction excludes border rows/columns (inner start=1 to end-1), replacing 0s with accent color and non-0/1 with background; motif length is inner height/width minus borders, but output dimensions involve (inner_cross * motif_len - 1) for main axis and (inner_cross) for cross axis.
 * Weaving logic shortens the last motif placement (uses motif_len -1 elements in final position) to create an interlocking or overlapping pattern across the cross dimension, avoiding full repetition.
 * Color extraction takes the first non-0/1 value in a panel as the color (assuming uniform); if bg or acc is 0, output empty—subtlety: panels might have mixed cells, but code assumes single color.
 * Empty or invalid templates (e.g., inner cross <=0 or insufficient size) return empty; separators must be full lines of 1s across the relevant axis.
 * Subtle element: Output is always rectangular, but main dimension is reduced by 1 to account for weaving overlap, which could mismatch if motif placement logic errs on boundaries.
 * Across attempts, ensure panel count >=4; training 1 failure suggests mis-split or wrong orientation/motif len for that case, possibly due to separator detection or vertical/horiz swap.
 * Consider grids with uneven panel sizes or partial 1s (but code requires full lines, so invalid seps ignored).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return w, h
```
Basic grid sizing, essential for orientation check and validation.

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    h = len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h])]
```
Core for detecting full separator lines; horizontal checks rows, vertical checks columns—key for splitting.

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([row[:] for row in g[start:sep]])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append([row[:] for row in g[start:]])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([[g[i][j] for j in range(start, sep)] for i in range(h)])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([[g[i][j] for j in range(start, len(g[0]))] for i in range(h)])
    return panels
```
Panel extraction utilities; row-based for vertical orient, col-based for horiz—correctly skips seps and copies subgrids.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set(cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1})
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Simple color pull from non-separator/non-empty cells; assumes single color per panel, helpful but could fail on multi-color (returns first).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 2, 3, and 4 all correct, indicating successful panel splitting, motif extraction, color assignment, and weaving for those cases—likely well-oriented grids with clear seps and valid templates.
 * Training example 1 incorrect: generated 3 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [2,2]) vs. expected 5 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [9,9], [2,2], [2,9])—suggests miscalculation of out_main height (possibly wrong motif_len or out_cross, or incomplete weaving with shortened last motif cutting too much; unknown if orientation was wrong, but effect is truncated output missing two rows with [9,9] pattern).
 * Overall, separator detection and panel extraction worked (got 4+ panels), color get_color succeeded (used 2 as bg?, 9 as acc), but vertical weaving logic failed to produce full expected length/ pattern for train 1—possibly border exclusion or pos increment in motif placement off by 1.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (dimensions, seps, panels, color) are relevant and functional, though weaving in program() body has bugs in dimension calc or loop for certain template sizes.
 * Empty returns on <4 panels or invalid dims worked as safeguard, preventing bad outputs in edge cases.

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 15-row by 5-column grid with repeating 3-row motif: row A [8,8,7,8,8], row B [8,7,7,7,8], row C [8,8,8,8,8], repeated ~5 times but ends abruptly after 14-15 rows without full cycles (listed as A,B,C x4 + A,B).
 * Pattern uses 8 (likely bg) dominant, 7 (likely acc) in "inner" positions of A/B, full 8s in C—suggests horizontal orientation (wide motif), successful color/motif extract, but repetition seems over-long or miscounted (out_main = out_cross * motif_len -1 might yield ~15 if template inner ~3x something, but weaving shortens last, possibly causing incomplete final cycle).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition is uniform but truncated/mismatched length (15 rows uneven for 3-row motif x5=15, but ends on B not C), and if test input expects tighter interlocking (like train1's [9,9] inserts), the full-8 rows might be overused; differs from train1 error by being too long vs. too short, hinting consistent but flawed dimension/weaving formula—account for exact pos increments to avoid partial motifs.

[2025-09-30 19:50:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):

    return separators

        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []

        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract a motif, the second-to-last panel providing the background color, and the last panel providing the accent color. The output is a generated pattern that weaves or repeats the motif from the template (replacing 0s with accent and others with background) into a larger grid, with orientation (vertical or horizontal) determined by whether height exceeds width, leading to row- or column-based panel splitting and motif application.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are split excluding the separator lines themselves (start after previous sep, end before next), but must result in at least 4 panels (template + at least two more for bg/acc) or output empty list.
 * Orientation check (h > w for vertical) dictates separator type: horizontal seps for vertical orientation (splitting rows), vertical seps for horizontal (splitting columns); this affects how the motif is extracted and woven.
 * Template motif extraction excludes border rows/columns (inner start=1 to end-1), replacing 0s with accent color and non-0/1 with background; motif length is inner height/width minus borders, but output dimensions involve (inner_cross * motif_len - 1) for main axis and (inner_cross) for cross axis.
 * Weaving logic shortens the last motif placement (uses motif_len -1 elements in final position) to create an interlocking or overlapping pattern across the cross dimension, avoiding full repetition.
 * Color extraction takes the first non-0/1 value in a panel as the color (assuming uniform); if bg or acc is 0, output empty—subtlety: panels might have mixed cells, but code assumes single color.
 * Empty or invalid templates (e.g., inner cross <=0 or insufficient size) return empty; separators must be full lines of 1s across the relevant axis.
 * Subtle element: Output is always rectangular, but main dimension is reduced by 1 to account for weaving overlap, which could mismatch if motif placement logic errs on boundaries.
 * Across attempts, ensure panel count >=4; training 1 failure suggests mis-split or wrong orientation/motif len for that case, possibly due to separator detection or vertical/horiz swap.
 * Consider grids with uneven panel sizes or partial 1s (but code requires full lines, so invalid seps ignored).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return w, h
```
Basic grid sizing, essential for orientation check and validation.

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    h = len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h])]
```
Core for detecting full separator lines; horizontal checks rows, vertical checks columns—key for splitting.

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([row[:] for row in g[start:sep]])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append([row[:] for row in g[start:]])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([[g[i][j] for j in range(start, sep)] for i in range(h)])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([[g[i][j] for j in range(start, len(g[0]))] for i in range(h)])
    return panels
```
Panel extraction utilities; row-based for vertical orient, col-based for horiz—correctly skips seps and copies subgrids.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set(cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1})
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Simple color pull from non-separator/non-empty cells; assumes single color per panel, helpful but could fail on multi-color (returns first).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 2, 3, and 4 all correct, indicating successful panel splitting, motif extraction, color assignment, and weaving for those cases—likely well-oriented grids with clear seps and valid templates.
 * Training example 1 incorrect: generated 3 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [2,2]) vs. expected 5 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [9,9], [2,2], [2,9])—suggests miscalculation of out_main height (possibly wrong motif_len or out_cross, or incomplete weaving with shortened last motif cutting too much; unknown if orientation was wrong, but effect is truncated output missing two rows with [9,9] pattern).
 * Overall, separator detection and panel extraction worked (got 4+ panels), color get_color succeeded (used 2 as bg?, 9 as acc), but vertical weaving logic failed to produce full expected length/ pattern for train 1—possibly border exclusion or pos increment in motif placement off by 1.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (dimensions, seps, panels, color) are relevant and functional, though weaving in program() body has bugs in dimension calc or loop for certain template sizes.
 * Empty returns on <4 panels or invalid dims worked as safeguard, preventing bad outputs in edge cases.

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 15-row by 5-column grid with repeating 3-row motif: row A [8,8,7,8,8], row B [8,7,7,7,8], row C [8,8,8,8,8], repeated ~5 times but ends abruptly after 14-15 rows without full cycles (listed as A,B,C x4 + A,B).
 * Pattern uses 8 (likely bg) dominant, 7 (likely acc) in "inner" positions of A/B, full 8s in C—suggests horizontal orientation (wide motif), successful color/motif extract, but repetition seems over-long or miscounted (out_main = out_cross * motif_len -1 might yield ~15 if template inner ~3x something, but weaving shortens last, possibly causing incomplete final cycle).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition is uniform but truncated/mismatched length (15 rows uneven for 3-row motif x5=15, but ends on B not C), and if test input expects tighter interlocking (like train1's [9,9] inserts), the full-8 rows might be overused; differs from train1 error by being too long vs. too short, hinting consistent but flawed dimension/weaving formula—account for exact pos increments to avoid partial motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0

            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

            panels.append([row[start:sep] for row in g])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([row[start:] for row in g])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

```python
def get_filled_pos(panel: List[List[int]], slice_idx: int, fill_value: int, is_vertical: bool, panel_main: int) -> List[int]:
    filled_pos = []
    if is_vertical:
        for r in range(panel_main):
            if panel[r][slice_idx] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(r)
    else:
        for j in range(panel_main):
            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-09-30 20:03:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by horizontal or vertical separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), with the first panel serving as a template pattern, the second-to-last panel defining a background color, and the last panel defining an accent color. The goal is to generate an output grid that tiles a motif extracted from the template (using background for certain template values like 4 and accent for others) across a combined main dimension derived from the background and accent panels, minus separators, while preserving the cross dimension minus borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by splitting on full lines of 1s; assume vertical orientation if height > width, using horizontal separators, else horizontal orientation with vertical separators—handle empty or single-panel cases by returning empty output.
 * Template motif is built from the inner area of the template (skipping border rows/columns, indexed from 1), mapping template value 4 to background color and other non-0/1 values to accent color; the motif size is (template_main - 1) by (template_cross - 2).
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2; main dimension is background_main + accent_main - 2 (accounting for shared separators or borders).
 * Tiling repeats the motif along the main dimension by cycling through its rows/columns to fill the full output_main length; orientation matters—vertical means rows are main, columns are cross; horizontal means columns are main, rows are cross.
 * Colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in a panel; if no such value or 0, output is empty.
 * Subtlety: The -2 in main dimension likely subtracts for the two separator lines (one from each panel), but this underestimates in some cases, leading to shorter outputs; ensure tiling covers the exact combined inner sizes without overlap loss.
 * Handle cases where panels have varying inner content (e.g., full-color panels for bg/acc); assume all panels are rectangular and aligned.
 * Easy to miss: Template borders are skipped (outer rows/cols are ignored in motif), and output has no borders (pure tiled motif); if fewer than 4 panels, output empty.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with numbers representing colors; generated outputs must match expected exactly in size and values.

        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)  # Core function to split grid into panels based on orientation
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies panels, extracts template/bg/acc, and builds a basic motif for training examples 1 and 4, passing them exactly.
 * For training 2 (horizontal orientation): Generated a 3x6 output, but expected 3x11; the output shows partial tiling of a 3x5 motif (repeating once fully but missing extensions), differing in width (6 vs 11 columns) and missing additional motif cycles in the second and third rows (e.g., expected has extra [8,3,8,8,8] patterns); likely due to underestimating out_main_num = bg_main + acc_main - 2, which didn't account for full combined inner length.
 * For training 3 (vertical orientation): Generated a 4x10 output, but expected 4x15; output tiles a motif partially (repeating ~2 times but truncated), differing in height per row? Wait, no—it's 4 rows x 10 cols vs 4x15, with missing extensions in each row (e.g., first row ends [6,6] but expected continues [4,4,6,6,4]); again, out_main_num too small, causing incomplete cycling along columns.
 * Training 1 and 4 succeeded, suggesting correct motif extraction and basic tiling logic, but scaling fails when bg/acc mains are larger, possibly miscounting inner dimensions (e.g., not subtracting borders correctly for bg/acc).
 * Function get_panel_main is helpful but may be broken: it returns full len(panel) for vertical (rows) but len(panel[0]) for horizontal (cols), without subtracting borders, leading to over-subtraction in out_main_num.
 * Functions like get_template_main_cross correctly skip template borders but assume fixed -1/-2; this works for small cases but not when bg/acc have internal structure.
 * No object extraction needed (grids are abstract colors, not shapes); prior unhelpful ideas like blob detection would be irrelevant here.
 * Subtle issue: In motif building, template indexing starts at +1 for main and +1 for cross, assuming 1-thick borders; if borders vary, this breaks—easy to miss if inputs always have uniform borders.
 * Tiling uses % l for cycling, which is correct but only fills to out_main_num, so root cause is dimension miscalculation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 10x5 grid that repeats a 4-row pattern (two full [8,8,7,8,8]/[8,7,7,7,8]/[8,8,8,8,8]/[7,7,7,7,7] blocks plus a partial third: two more rows), suggesting vertical orientation with cross=5 (template_cross-2? but includes borders?) and main=10, but it looks incorrect because the pattern doesn't align with a clean motif tiling—e.g., the third block starts repeating the first two rows without completing the 4-row motif or matching expected seamless extension; likely same dimension error as training 2/3, under-tiling the full bg+acc main (expected probably longer, like 12-15 rows with full cycles using 7 as acc and 8 as bg). It doesn't make sense as a final puzzle output, as it appears truncated mid-motif, missing the full combined length and possibly inverting bg/acc mapping (e.g., if template has 4s as bg but here 7/8 placement seems off).

[2025-09-30 20:03:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

def extract_panels(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w, h = get_dimensions(g)
    orientation = 'vertical' if h > w else 'horizontal'
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        seps = find_horizontal_separators(g)
        return get_panel_rows(g, seps)
    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)
```
(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by horizontal or vertical separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), with the first panel serving as a template pattern, the second-to-last panel defining a background color, and the last panel defining an accent color. The goal is to generate an output grid that tiles a motif extracted from the template (using background for certain template values like 4 and accent for others) across a combined main dimension derived from the background and accent panels, minus separators, while preserving the cross dimension minus borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by splitting on full lines of 1s; assume vertical orientation if height > width, using horizontal separators, else horizontal orientation with vertical separators—handle empty or single-panel cases by returning empty output.
 * Template motif is built from the inner area of the template (skipping border rows/columns, indexed from 1), mapping template value 4 to background color and other non-0/1 values to accent color; the motif size is (template_main - 1) by (template_cross - 2).
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2; main dimension is background_main + accent_main - 2 (accounting for shared separators or borders).
 * Tiling repeats the motif along the main dimension by cycling through its rows/columns to fill the full output_main length; orientation matters—vertical means rows are main, columns are cross; horizontal means columns are main, rows are cross.
 * Colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in a panel; if no such value or 0, output is empty.
 * Subtlety: The -2 in main dimension likely subtracts for the two separator lines (one from each panel), but this underestimates in some cases, leading to shorter outputs; ensure tiling covers the exact combined inner sizes without overlap loss.
 * Handle cases where panels have varying inner content (e.g., full-color panels for bg/acc); assume all panels are rectangular and aligned.
 * Easy to miss: Template borders are skipped (outer rows/cols are ignored in motif), and output has no borders (pure tiled motif); if fewer than 4 panels, output empty.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with numbers representing colors; generated outputs must match expected exactly in size and values.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies panels, extracts template/bg/acc, and builds a basic motif for training examples 1 and 4, passing them exactly.
 * For training 2 (horizontal orientation): Generated a 3x6 output, but expected 3x11; the output shows partial tiling of a 3x5 motif (repeating once fully but missing extensions), differing in width (6 vs 11 columns) and missing additional motif cycles in the second and third rows (e.g., expected has extra [8,3,8,8,8] patterns); likely due to underestimating out_main_num = bg_main + acc_main - 2, which didn't account for full combined inner length.
 * For training 3 (vertical orientation): Generated a 4x10 output, but expected 4x15; output tiles a motif partially (repeating ~2 times but truncated), differing in height per row? Wait, no—it's 4 rows x 10 cols vs 4x15, with missing extensions in each row (e.g., first row ends [6,6] but expected continues [4,4,6,6,4]); again, out_main_num too small, causing incomplete cycling along columns.
 * Training 1 and 4 succeeded, suggesting correct motif extraction and basic tiling logic, but scaling fails when bg/acc mains are larger, possibly miscounting inner dimensions (e.g., not subtracting borders correctly for bg/acc).
 * Function get_panel_main is helpful but may be broken: it returns full len(panel) for vertical (rows) but len(panel[0]) for horizontal (cols), without subtracting borders, leading to over-subtraction in out_main_num.
 * Functions like get_template_main_cross correctly skip template borders but assume fixed -1/-2; this works for small cases but not when bg/acc have internal structure.
 * No object extraction needed (grids are abstract colors, not shapes); prior unhelpful ideas like blob detection would be irrelevant here.
 * Subtle issue: In motif building, template indexing starts at +1 for main and +1 for cross, assuming 1-thick borders; if borders vary, this breaks—easy to miss if inputs always have uniform borders.
 * Tiling uses % l for cycling, which is correct but only fills to out_main_num, so root cause is dimension miscalculation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 10x5 grid that repeats a 4-row pattern (two full [8,8,7,8,8]/[8,7,7,7,8]/[8,8,8,8,8]/[7,7,7,7,7] blocks plus a partial third: two more rows), suggesting vertical orientation with cross=5 (template_cross-2? but includes borders?) and main=10, but it looks incorrect because the pattern doesn't align with a clean motif tiling—e.g., the third block starts repeating the first two rows without completing the 4-row motif or matching expected seamless extension; likely same dimension error as training 2/3, under-tiling the full bg+acc main (expected probably longer, like 12-15 rows with full cycles using 7 as acc and 8 as bg). It doesn't make sense as a final puzzle output, as it appears truncated mid-motif, missing the full combined length and possibly inverting bg/acc mapping (e.g., if template has 4s as bg but here 7/8 placement seems off).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract a motif, the second-to-last panel providing the background color, and the last panel providing the accent color. The output is a generated pattern that weaves or repeats the motif from the template (replacing 0s with accent and others with background) into a larger grid, with orientation (vertical or horizontal) determined by whether height exceeds width, leading to row- or column-based panel splitting and motif application.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are split excluding the separator lines themselves (start after previous sep, end before next), but must result in at least 4 panels (template + at least two more for bg/acc) or output empty list.
 * Orientation check (h > w for vertical) dictates separator type: horizontal seps for vertical orientation (splitting rows), vertical seps for horizontal (splitting columns); this affects how the motif is extracted and woven.
 * Template motif extraction excludes border rows/columns (inner start=1 to end-1), replacing 0s with accent color and non-0/1 with background; motif length is inner height/width minus borders, but output dimensions involve (inner_cross * motif_len - 1) for main axis and (inner_cross) for cross axis.
 * Weaving logic shortens the last motif placement (uses motif_len -1 elements in final position) to create an interlocking or overlapping pattern across the cross dimension, avoiding full repetition.
 * Color extraction takes the first non-0/1 value in a panel as the color (assuming uniform); if bg or acc is 0, output empty—subtlety: panels might have mixed cells, but code assumes single color.
 * Empty or invalid templates (e.g., inner cross <=0 or insufficient size) return empty; separators must be full lines of 1s across the relevant axis.
 * Subtle element: Output is always rectangular, but main dimension is reduced by 1 to account for weaving overlap, which could mismatch if motif placement logic errs on boundaries.
 * Across attempts, ensure panel count >=4; training 1 failure suggests mis-split or wrong orientation/motif len for that case, possibly due to separator detection or vertical/horiz swap.
 * Consider grids with uneven panel sizes or partial 1s (but code requires full lines, so invalid seps ignored).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return w, h
```
Basic grid sizing, essential for orientation check and validation.

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    h = len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h])]
```
Core for detecting full separator lines; horizontal checks rows, vertical checks columns—key for splitting.

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([row[:] for row in g[start:sep]])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append([row[:] for row in g[start:]])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([[g[i][j] for j in range(start, sep)] for i in range(h)])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([[g[i][j] for j in range(start, len(g[0]))] for i in range(h)])
    return panels
```
Panel extraction utilities; row-based for vertical orient, col-based for horiz—correctly skips seps and copies subgrids.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set(cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1})
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Simple color pull from non-separator/non-empty cells; assumes single color per panel, helpful but could fail on multi-color (returns first).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 2, 3, and 4 all correct, indicating successful panel splitting, motif extraction, color assignment, and weaving for those cases—likely well-oriented grids with clear seps and valid templates.
 * Training example 1 incorrect: generated 3 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [2,2]) vs. expected 5 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [9,9], [2,2], [2,9])—suggests miscalculation of out_main height (possibly wrong motif_len or out_cross, or incomplete weaving with shortened last motif cutting too much; unknown if orientation was wrong, but effect is truncated output missing two rows with [9,9] pattern).
 * Overall, separator detection and panel extraction worked (got 4+ panels), color get_color succeeded (used 2 as bg?, 9 as acc), but vertical weaving logic failed to produce full expected length/ pattern for train 1—possibly border exclusion or pos increment in motif placement off by 1.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (dimensions, seps, panels, color) are relevant and functional, though weaving in program() body has bugs in dimension calc or loop for certain template sizes.
 * Empty returns on <4 panels or invalid dims worked as safeguard, preventing bad outputs in edge cases.

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 15-row by 5-column grid with repeating 3-row motif: row A [8,8,7,8,8], row B [8,7,7,7,8], row C [8,8,8,8,8], repeated ~5 times but ends abruptly after 14-15 rows without full cycles (listed as A,B,C x4 + A,B).
 * Pattern uses 8 (likely bg) dominant, 7 (likely acc) in "inner" positions of A/B, full 8s in C—suggests horizontal orientation (wide motif), successful color/motif extract, but repetition seems over-long or miscounted (out_main = out_cross * motif_len -1 might yield ~15 if template inner ~3x something, but weaving shortens last, possibly causing incomplete final cycle).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition is uniform but truncated/mismatched length (15 rows uneven for 3-row motif x5=15, but ends on B not C), and if test input expects tighter interlocking (like train1's [9,9] inserts), the full-8 rows might be overused; differs from train1 error by being too long vs. too short, hinting consistent but flawed dimension/weaving formula—account for exact pos increments to avoid partial motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g[0]), len(g)  # (w, h)
```

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]

    w, h = len(g[0]), len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h))]
```

```python

    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append([row[start:sep] for row in g])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g[0]):
        panels.append([row[start:] for row in g])
    return panels
```

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

```python
def get_filled_pos(panel: List[List[int]], slice_idx: int, fill_value: int, is_vertical: bool, panel_main: int) -> List[int]:
    filled_pos = []
    if is_vertical:
        for r in range(panel_main):
            if panel[r][slice_idx] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(r)
    else:
        for j in range(panel_main):
            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-09-30 20:17:02] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, where the first panel serves as a template pattern (with 4s indicating filled positions and 1s as borders), the second-to-last panel provides a background color, and the last panel provides an accent color; the goal is to generate a larger output grid that tiles or extends the template's motif using the accent color on a background, adjusting dimensions based on panel sizes and orientation (vertical or horizontal layout).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by rows or columns entirely filled with 1s; the code assumes horizontal separators if height > width, vertical otherwise, but this may not always hold if the grid is square or if separators are mixed.
 * Template panel uses 4 as a fill marker for the motif pattern, with 1s as borders; the motif is extracted as contiguous filled positions per "slice" (column if vertical, row if horizontal), and it's repeated with a motif_len = template_main - 1, but this repetition logic fails when the pattern isn't strictly periodic or when slices have non-contiguous fills.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in their panels; if missing (returns 0), output is empty, which is a safeguard but may skip valid cases.
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2 (removing borders), main dimension varies— for vertical: bg_main + acc_main - 2; for horizontal non-contiguous: same, but for horizontal contiguous: bg_main + acc_main + template_main - 2—which introduces inconsistencies and likely causes dimension mismatches.
 * Motif application: accent is placed in output where i % motif_len matches filled positions in template slices; this assumes a simple modular repetition, but puzzles may require mirroring, scaling, or combining bg/acc patterns differently (e.g., bg and acc influencing motif density or position).
 * Contiguity check: Ensures filled positions in each slice are consecutive without gaps; if not, adjusts out_main, but this is only applied in horizontal case, leading to asymmetric handling.
 * Edge cases: Empty panels, zero dimensions, or no 4s in template lead to empty output; color extraction ignores 0/1 but assumes exactly one other color per panel.
 * Orientation matters: Vertical layout treats rows as main dimension, columns as cross; swapping may be needed if initial assumption fails.
 * Subtle: Outputs must match exact expected grids, including size and values; even small shifts in motif placement or dimension calculation cause full mismatches.
 * All training examples show pattern inversion or misalignment (e.g., expected symmetric frames become offset repeats), suggesting the tiling/repetition doesn't capture the puzzle's "framing" or "mirroring" rule.

These functions are solid for panel extraction and color detection but need refinement in motif tiling logic. The contiguity check in the original is helpful for detecting gaps but is inconsistently applied.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The motif application loop in the original (using i % motif_len in filled_set) is broken—it produces offset or incomplete repeats, as seen in all examples; avoid direct reuse without fixing the periodicity or mirroring. The dimension calculation for out_main is inconsistent and often undersizes/oversizes the output, leading to shape mismatches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, panel extraction via separators works partially, correctly identifying template, bg_panel, and acc_panel in structure, but fails to generate the correct tiled pattern.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 5x2 grid with alternating 2/9 rows in a zigzag, but expected a framed pattern with 2 borders around 9 centers in columns; difference: motif repetition created vertical stripes instead of horizontal framing, and dimensions matched but content was inverted (e.g., [9,9] where [2,9] expected).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 3x11 grid with repeating 8/3 stripes that don't align symmetrically, but expected a cross-like pattern with 8 frames and 3 accents in a mirrored way; difference: output has irregular 3-clumps in rows 1-3, while expected has uniform 8-rows with 3 insertions in row 2; unknown why the vertical tiling didn't capture the horizontal symmetry.
 * Training example 3: Generated a 4x15 grid with scattered 6/4 blocks, but expected a more structured frame with 6 borders and 4 fills in a repeating unit; difference: output rows have mismatched lengths in patterns (e.g., row 0 has 6,4,4,6... but expected row 0 is 6,6,4,4,...), suggesting failed contiguity or wrong motif_len; the +template_main adjustment wasn't triggered correctly.
 * Training example 4: Generated a 2x7 grid with 2/8 in a simple repeat, but expected a full 2-border frame around 8 in row 0; difference: row 0 is [2,8,8,8,2,8,8] (partial frame with extra 8s), row 1 matches exactly—close but overflows the framing rule.
 * extract_panels is essential and mostly correct for splitting, but assumes fixed panel roles (first=template, -2=bg, -1=acc) which holds here but may not if panels vary.
 * Color extraction works in all cases (e.g., 9,3,4,8 correctly pulled).
 * Dimension logic partially works (e.g., out_cross = template_cross - 2 avoids borders), but out_main calculation fails consistently, often ignoring bg/acc contributions properly.
 * Contiguity check is useful but only applied selectively, missing gaps in vertical cases and causing non-contiguous accents to misplace.
 * All attempts miss the puzzle's likely "framing" or "border extension" rule, where bg/acc panels suggest how to extend the template into a larger symmetric structure rather than modular tiling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x4 motif block (two copies of a plus-like pattern with 8 bg and 7 acc) vertically, but it does not look correct—it's overly repetitive and lacks variation, suggesting the program defaulted to horizontal layout and simple % repetition without adapting to the test input's specific template.
 * Expected output likely involves a single extended frame or tiled unit using 8 as bg and 7 as acc in a cross/plus shape extended by bg/acc panel sizes, but generated has stacked duplicates (e.g., lines 0-4 repeat in 5-9) with no dimension adjustment, making it too tall and uniform; this mismatches the training expectations of asymmetric or mirrored extensions.
 * The output ignores potential vertical orientation or contiguity, producing a "wallpaper" effect instead of a puzzle-specific composition; to handle test, need to verify if test input has horizontal/vertical separators and adjust motif to non-modular placement (e.g., direct concatenation or mirroring).

[2025-09-30 20:17:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

    orientation = 'vertical' if h > w else 'horizontal'
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        seps = find_horizontal_separators(g)
        return get_panel_rows(g, seps)
    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)
```
(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

        return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 4]  # Similar issue; template positions seem implicit from structure, not hardcoded 4
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, where the first panel serves as a template pattern (with 4s indicating filled positions and 1s as borders), the second-to-last panel provides a background color, and the last panel provides an accent color; the goal is to generate a larger output grid that tiles or extends the template's motif using the accent color on a background, adjusting dimensions based on panel sizes and orientation (vertical or horizontal layout).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by rows or columns entirely filled with 1s; the code assumes horizontal separators if height > width, vertical otherwise, but this may not always hold if the grid is square or if separators are mixed.
 * Template panel uses 4 as a fill marker for the motif pattern, with 1s as borders; the motif is extracted as contiguous filled positions per "slice" (column if vertical, row if horizontal), and it's repeated with a motif_len = template_main - 1, but this repetition logic fails when the pattern isn't strictly periodic or when slices have non-contiguous fills.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in their panels; if missing (returns 0), output is empty, which is a safeguard but may skip valid cases.
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2 (removing borders), main dimension varies— for vertical: bg_main + acc_main - 2; for horizontal non-contiguous: same, but for horizontal contiguous: bg_main + acc_main + template_main - 2—which introduces inconsistencies and likely causes dimension mismatches.
 * Motif application: accent is placed in output where i % motif_len matches filled positions in template slices; this assumes a simple modular repetition, but puzzles may require mirroring, scaling, or combining bg/acc patterns differently (e.g., bg and acc influencing motif density or position).
 * Contiguity check: Ensures filled positions in each slice are consecutive without gaps; if not, adjusts out_main, but this is only applied in horizontal case, leading to asymmetric handling.
 * Edge cases: Empty panels, zero dimensions, or no 4s in template lead to empty output; color extraction ignores 0/1 but assumes exactly one other color per panel.
 * Orientation matters: Vertical layout treats rows as main dimension, columns as cross; swapping may be needed if initial assumption fails.
 * Subtle: Outputs must match exact expected grids, including size and values; even small shifts in motif placement or dimension calculation cause full mismatches.
 * All training examples show pattern inversion or misalignment (e.g., expected symmetric frames become offset repeats), suggesting the tiling/repetition doesn't capture the puzzle's "framing" or "mirroring" rule.

These functions are solid for panel extraction and color detection but need refinement in motif tiling logic. The contiguity check in the original is helpful for detecting gaps but is inconsistently applied.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The motif application loop in the original (using i % motif_len in filled_set) is broken—it produces offset or incomplete repeats, as seen in all examples; avoid direct reuse without fixing the periodicity or mirroring. The dimension calculation for out_main is inconsistent and often undersizes/oversizes the output, leading to shape mismatches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, panel extraction via separators works partially, correctly identifying template, bg_panel, and acc_panel in structure, but fails to generate the correct tiled pattern.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 5x2 grid with alternating 2/9 rows in a zigzag, but expected a framed pattern with 2 borders around 9 centers in columns; difference: motif repetition created vertical stripes instead of horizontal framing, and dimensions matched but content was inverted (e.g., [9,9] where [2,9] expected).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 3x11 grid with repeating 8/3 stripes that don't align symmetrically, but expected a cross-like pattern with 8 frames and 3 accents in a mirrored way; difference: output has irregular 3-clumps in rows 1-3, while expected has uniform 8-rows with 3 insertions in row 2; unknown why the vertical tiling didn't capture the horizontal symmetry.
 * Training example 3: Generated a 4x15 grid with scattered 6/4 blocks, but expected a more structured frame with 6 borders and 4 fills in a repeating unit; difference: output rows have mismatched lengths in patterns (e.g., row 0 has 6,4,4,6... but expected row 0 is 6,6,4,4,...), suggesting failed contiguity or wrong motif_len; the +template_main adjustment wasn't triggered correctly.
 * Training example 4: Generated a 2x7 grid with 2/8 in a simple repeat, but expected a full 2-border frame around 8 in row 0; difference: row 0 is [2,8,8,8,2,8,8] (partial frame with extra 8s), row 1 matches exactly—close but overflows the framing rule.
 * extract_panels is essential and mostly correct for splitting, but assumes fixed panel roles (first=template, -2=bg, -1=acc) which holds here but may not if panels vary.
 * Color extraction works in all cases (e.g., 9,3,4,8 correctly pulled).
 * Dimension logic partially works (e.g., out_cross = template_cross - 2 avoids borders), but out_main calculation fails consistently, often ignoring bg/acc contributions properly.
 * Contiguity check is useful but only applied selectively, missing gaps in vertical cases and causing non-contiguous accents to misplace.
 * All attempts miss the puzzle's likely "framing" or "border extension" rule, where bg/acc panels suggest how to extend the template into a larger symmetric structure rather than modular tiling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x4 motif block (two copies of a plus-like pattern with 8 bg and 7 acc) vertically, but it does not look correct—it's overly repetitive and lacks variation, suggesting the program defaulted to horizontal layout and simple % repetition without adapting to the test input's specific template.
 * Expected output likely involves a single extended frame or tiled unit using 8 as bg and 7 as acc in a cross/plus shape extended by bg/acc panel sizes, but generated has stacked duplicates (e.g., lines 0-4 repeat in 5-9) with no dimension adjustment, making it too tall and uniform; this mismatches the training expectations of asymmetric or mirrored extensions.
 * The output ignores potential vertical orientation or contiguity, producing a "wallpaper" effect instead of a puzzle-specific composition; to handle test, need to verify if test input has horizontal/vertical separators and adjust motif to non-modular placement (e.g., direct concatenation or mirroring).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by horizontal or vertical separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), with the first panel serving as a template pattern, the second-to-last panel defining a background color, and the last panel defining an accent color. The goal is to generate an output grid that tiles a motif extracted from the template (using background for certain template values like 4 and accent for others) across a combined main dimension derived from the background and accent panels, minus separators, while preserving the cross dimension minus borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by splitting on full lines of 1s; assume vertical orientation if height > width, using horizontal separators, else horizontal orientation with vertical separators—handle empty or single-panel cases by returning empty output.
 * Template motif is built from the inner area of the template (skipping border rows/columns, indexed from 1), mapping template value 4 to background color and other non-0/1 values to accent color; the motif size is (template_main - 1) by (template_cross - 2).
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2; main dimension is background_main + accent_main - 2 (accounting for shared separators or borders).
 * Tiling repeats the motif along the main dimension by cycling through its rows/columns to fill the full output_main length; orientation matters—vertical means rows are main, columns are cross; horizontal means columns are main, rows are cross.
 * Colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in a panel; if no such value or 0, output is empty.
 * Subtlety: The -2 in main dimension likely subtracts for the two separator lines (one from each panel), but this underestimates in some cases, leading to shorter outputs; ensure tiling covers the exact combined inner sizes without overlap loss.
 * Handle cases where panels have varying inner content (e.g., full-color panels for bg/acc); assume all panels are rectangular and aligned.
 * Easy to miss: Template borders are skipped (outer rows/cols are ignored in motif), and output has no borders (pure tiled motif); if fewer than 4 panels, output empty.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with numbers representing colors; generated outputs must match expected exactly in size and values.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies panels, extracts template/bg/acc, and builds a basic motif for training examples 1 and 4, passing them exactly.
 * For training 2 (horizontal orientation): Generated a 3x6 output, but expected 3x11; the output shows partial tiling of a 3x5 motif (repeating once fully but missing extensions), differing in width (6 vs 11 columns) and missing additional motif cycles in the second and third rows (e.g., expected has extra [8,3,8,8,8] patterns); likely due to underestimating out_main_num = bg_main + acc_main - 2, which didn't account for full combined inner length.
 * For training 3 (vertical orientation): Generated a 4x10 output, but expected 4x15; output tiles a motif partially (repeating ~2 times but truncated), differing in height per row? Wait, no—it's 4 rows x 10 cols vs 4x15, with missing extensions in each row (e.g., first row ends [6,6] but expected continues [4,4,6,6,4]); again, out_main_num too small, causing incomplete cycling along columns.
 * Training 1 and 4 succeeded, suggesting correct motif extraction and basic tiling logic, but scaling fails when bg/acc mains are larger, possibly miscounting inner dimensions (e.g., not subtracting borders correctly for bg/acc).
 * Function get_panel_main is helpful but may be broken: it returns full len(panel) for vertical (rows) but len(panel[0]) for horizontal (cols), without subtracting borders, leading to over-subtraction in out_main_num.
 * Functions like get_template_main_cross correctly skip template borders but assume fixed -1/-2; this works for small cases but not when bg/acc have internal structure.
 * No object extraction needed (grids are abstract colors, not shapes); prior unhelpful ideas like blob detection would be irrelevant here.
 * Subtle issue: In motif building, template indexing starts at +1 for main and +1 for cross, assuming 1-thick borders; if borders vary, this breaks—easy to miss if inputs always have uniform borders.
 * Tiling uses % l for cycling, which is correct but only fills to out_main_num, so root cause is dimension miscalculation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 10x5 grid that repeats a 4-row pattern (two full [8,8,7,8,8]/[8,7,7,7,8]/[8,8,8,8,8]/[7,7,7,7,7] blocks plus a partial third: two more rows), suggesting vertical orientation with cross=5 (template_cross-2? but includes borders?) and main=10, but it looks incorrect because the pattern doesn't align with a clean motif tiling—e.g., the third block starts repeating the first two rows without completing the 4-row motif or matching expected seamless extension; likely same dimension error as training 2/3, under-tiling the full bg+acc main (expected probably longer, like 12-15 rows with full cycles using 7 as acc and 8 as bg). It doesn't make sense as a final puzzle output, as it appears truncated mid-motif, missing the full combined length and possibly inverting bg/acc mapping (e.g., if template has 4s as bg but here 7/8 placement seems off).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract a motif, the second-to-last panel providing the background color, and the last panel providing the accent color. The output is a generated pattern that weaves or repeats the motif from the template (replacing 0s with accent and others with background) into a larger grid, with orientation (vertical or horizontal) determined by whether height exceeds width, leading to row- or column-based panel splitting and motif application.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are split excluding the separator lines themselves (start after previous sep, end before next), but must result in at least 4 panels (template + at least two more for bg/acc) or output empty list.
 * Orientation check (h > w for vertical) dictates separator type: horizontal seps for vertical orientation (splitting rows), vertical seps for horizontal (splitting columns); this affects how the motif is extracted and woven.
 * Template motif extraction excludes border rows/columns (inner start=1 to end-1), replacing 0s with accent color and non-0/1 with background; motif length is inner height/width minus borders, but output dimensions involve (inner_cross * motif_len - 1) for main axis and (inner_cross) for cross axis.
 * Weaving logic shortens the last motif placement (uses motif_len -1 elements in final position) to create an interlocking or overlapping pattern across the cross dimension, avoiding full repetition.
 * Color extraction takes the first non-0/1 value in a panel as the color (assuming uniform); if bg or acc is 0, output empty—subtlety: panels might have mixed cells, but code assumes single color.
 * Empty or invalid templates (e.g., inner cross <=0 or insufficient size) return empty; separators must be full lines of 1s across the relevant axis.
 * Subtle element: Output is always rectangular, but main dimension is reduced by 1 to account for weaving overlap, which could mismatch if motif placement logic errs on boundaries.
 * Across attempts, ensure panel count >=4; training 1 failure suggests mis-split or wrong orientation/motif len for that case, possibly due to separator detection or vertical/horiz swap.
 * Consider grids with uneven panel sizes or partial 1s (but code requires full lines, so invalid seps ignored).

Basic grid sizing, essential for orientation check and validation.

Core for detecting full separator lines; horizontal checks rows, vertical checks columns—key for splitting.

    start = 0
    for sep in separators:

```
Panel extraction utilities; row-based for vertical orient, col-based for horiz—correctly skips seps and copies subgrids.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set(cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1})
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Simple color pull from non-separator/non-empty cells; assumes single color per panel, helpful but could fail on multi-color (returns first).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 2, 3, and 4 all correct, indicating successful panel splitting, motif extraction, color assignment, and weaving for those cases—likely well-oriented grids with clear seps and valid templates.
 * Training example 1 incorrect: generated 3 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [2,2]) vs. expected 5 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [9,9], [2,2], [2,9])—suggests miscalculation of out_main height (possibly wrong motif_len or out_cross, or incomplete weaving with shortened last motif cutting too much; unknown if orientation was wrong, but effect is truncated output missing two rows with [9,9] pattern).
 * Overall, separator detection and panel extraction worked (got 4+ panels), color get_color succeeded (used 2 as bg?, 9 as acc), but vertical weaving logic failed to produce full expected length/ pattern for train 1—possibly border exclusion or pos increment in motif placement off by 1.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (dimensions, seps, panels, color) are relevant and functional, though weaving in program() body has bugs in dimension calc or loop for certain template sizes.
 * Empty returns on <4 panels or invalid dims worked as safeguard, preventing bad outputs in edge cases.

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 15-row by 5-column grid with repeating 3-row motif: row A [8,8,7,8,8], row B [8,7,7,7,8], row C [8,8,8,8,8], repeated ~5 times but ends abruptly after 14-15 rows without full cycles (listed as A,B,C x4 + A,B).
 * Pattern uses 8 (likely bg) dominant, 7 (likely acc) in "inner" positions of A/B, full 8s in C—suggests horizontal orientation (wide motif), successful color/motif extract, but repetition seems over-long or miscounted (out_main = out_cross * motif_len -1 might yield ~15 if template inner ~3x something, but weaving shortens last, possibly causing incomplete final cycle).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition is uniform but truncated/mismatched length (15 rows uneven for 3-row motif x5=15, but ends on B not C), and if test input expects tighter interlocking (like train1's [9,9] inserts), the full-8 rows might be overused; differs from train1 error by being too long vs. too short, hinting consistent but flawed dimension/weaving formula—account for exact pos increments to avoid partial motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-09-30 20:24:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid is divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), and the first panel serves as a template to generate a larger output grid by tiling a motif derived from the template's inner content, using colors extracted from background and accent panels (the second-to-last and last panels). The output orients vertically or horizontally based on the input's aspect ratio, with the motif placing background color where the template has 4s and accent color elsewhere, plus an extra accent column/row for periodicity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are strictly full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical layouts, vertical for horizontal); partial 1s or other values do not count, and empty grids return empty outputs.
 * Orientation is determined by height > width (vertical: row-based panels) vs. otherwise (horizontal: column-based panels), which affects how panels are extracted and how the output is tiled (row-wise vs. column-wise).
 * Panels must be at least 4 for processing; fewer result in empty output—template is first panel, bg is second-last, acc is last; colors are the unique non-0/1 value in bg/acc panels (0 if none).
 * Template processing excludes a 1-cell border (inner_main = main_dim - 2, inner_cross = cross_dim - 2); if either <=0, output is empty.
 * Motif construction: For each inner cross position, fill inner_main positions with bg_color if template inner value ==4, else acc_color; append an extra acc_color position for period = inner_main +1.
 * Output main dimension calculation has a subtlety for horizontal layouts: If all filled slices (where template inner ==4) are contiguous per cross position, out_main = template_main + bg_main + acc_main -2; else out_main = bg_main + acc_main -2 (vertical always uses bg_main + acc_main -2).
 * Tiling wraps the motif periodically along the main dimension (pos = i % period), filling the cross dimension directly from motif.
 * Borders in template/panels are assumed to be 1s or ignored for inner extraction; get_inner_value skips the border by indexing at 1+ offsets.
 * Colors must be non-zero/non-1; if bg or acc color is 0, output empty—ensures valid motif.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal contiguous check only applies if there are filled positions; empty filled slices are okay but don't affect contiguity. Also, panel extraction skips separators (start = sep +1), so panels don't include 1-lines.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 and g[0] else 0
    return w, h  # Returns (width, height); useful for orientation check (h > w -> vertical)
```

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

    h = len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h))]  # Finds full columns of 1s for horizontal layouts
```

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels  # Extracts row-based panels, skipping separators; symmetric get_panel_columns for columns

def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0  # Extracts unique non-border/non-empty color; essential for bg/acc
```

```python
def get_inner_value(temp: List[List[int]], j: int, c: int, is_vertical: bool) -> int:
    if is_vertical:
        return temp[1 + j][1 + c]  # Border skip for vertical template access
    else:
        return temp[1 + c][1 + j]  # Border skip for horizontal template access
# Note: This is derived from the program's logic; useful for motif building without full grid
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the presented attempt (no prior ones shown); it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid grasp of panel splitting, color extraction, motif periodicity, and tiling for both orientations.
 * Worked well: Separator detection accurately splits into panels; color extraction ignores 0/1 borders; inner template processing with 4->bg mapping produces expected motif; contiguity check for horizontal out_main adjustment passed trainings without issues.
 * Did not work/missed: No failures in training, but the horizontal contiguity logic (filled slices must be contiguous per cross position) is only used if slices are non-empty—could miss cases where template has no 4s at all (falls back to bg+acc-2, which worked for trainings).
 * get_dimensions, find_separators, get_panel_rows/columns, and get_color are essential and correct; they robustly handle empty/edge cases.
 * The program's get_panel_main (len(pan) or len(pan[0])) is helpful for dimension extraction but assumes non-empty panels—could fail silently if panels are empty (returns 0, leading to empty output, which is safe).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the contiguity check's get_filled_for_slice is specific to horizontal and could be generalized but isn't broken.
 * Trainings all correct, so no mismatches in blob shapes, omissions, or divider issues; unknown if trainings had contiguous vs. non-contiguous cases, but it handled them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, 5 columns each) with a clear repeating pattern: three row types cycle ( [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8] ) followed by [7,7,7,7,7], repeating the first three twice more, suggesting horizontal orientation with period=4 (inner_main=3 +1), out_cross=5, and out_main=10 (possibly from contiguity allowing template_main + bg + acc -2).
 * It makes sense as a tiled motif: Columns 1-5 show varying 7/8 placements, with full 8-row and full 7-row insertions, aligning with accent/bg colors (assuming 7=acc, 8=bg) and periodic filling where template inners dictate positions.
 * Looks correct based on rules—no empty output despite complex dims, pattern repeats consistently without gaps/overlaps, and includes full accent rows (all 7s) as expected from bg/acc panels; no obvious differences from expected (e.g., no missing borders or wrong periodicity), but without test input grid, can't confirm exact panel splits or colors—assume matches since trainings passed.
 * Subtle: The output has 3 full cycles minus one, with inserted all-7 and all-8 rows; if test input had non-contiguous 4s, it correctly used shorter out_main, but pattern suggests contiguity was true.

[2025-09-30 20:24:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0

        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, where the first panel serves as a template pattern (with 4s indicating filled positions and 1s as borders), the second-to-last panel provides a background color, and the last panel provides an accent color; the goal is to generate a larger output grid that tiles or extends the template's motif using the accent color on a background, adjusting dimensions based on panel sizes and orientation (vertical or horizontal layout).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by rows or columns entirely filled with 1s; the code assumes horizontal separators if height > width, vertical otherwise, but this may not always hold if the grid is square or if separators are mixed.
 * Template panel uses 4 as a fill marker for the motif pattern, with 1s as borders; the motif is extracted as contiguous filled positions per "slice" (column if vertical, row if horizontal), and it's repeated with a motif_len = template_main - 1, but this repetition logic fails when the pattern isn't strictly periodic or when slices have non-contiguous fills.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in their panels; if missing (returns 0), output is empty, which is a safeguard but may skip valid cases.
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2 (removing borders), main dimension varies— for vertical: bg_main + acc_main - 2; for horizontal non-contiguous: same, but for horizontal contiguous: bg_main + acc_main + template_main - 2—which introduces inconsistencies and likely causes dimension mismatches.
 * Motif application: accent is placed in output where i % motif_len matches filled positions in template slices; this assumes a simple modular repetition, but puzzles may require mirroring, scaling, or combining bg/acc patterns differently (e.g., bg and acc influencing motif density or position).
 * Contiguity check: Ensures filled positions in each slice are consecutive without gaps; if not, adjusts out_main, but this is only applied in horizontal case, leading to asymmetric handling.
 * Edge cases: Empty panels, zero dimensions, or no 4s in template lead to empty output; color extraction ignores 0/1 but assumes exactly one other color per panel.
 * Orientation matters: Vertical layout treats rows as main dimension, columns as cross; swapping may be needed if initial assumption fails.
 * Subtle: Outputs must match exact expected grids, including size and values; even small shifts in motif placement or dimension calculation cause full mismatches.
 * All training examples show pattern inversion or misalignment (e.g., expected symmetric frames become offset repeats), suggesting the tiling/repetition doesn't capture the puzzle's "framing" or "mirroring" rule.

These functions are solid for panel extraction and color detection but need refinement in motif tiling logic. The contiguity check in the original is helpful for detecting gaps but is inconsistently applied.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The motif application loop in the original (using i % motif_len in filled_set) is broken—it produces offset or incomplete repeats, as seen in all examples; avoid direct reuse without fixing the periodicity or mirroring. The dimension calculation for out_main is inconsistent and often undersizes/oversizes the output, leading to shape mismatches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, panel extraction via separators works partially, correctly identifying template, bg_panel, and acc_panel in structure, but fails to generate the correct tiled pattern.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 5x2 grid with alternating 2/9 rows in a zigzag, but expected a framed pattern with 2 borders around 9 centers in columns; difference: motif repetition created vertical stripes instead of horizontal framing, and dimensions matched but content was inverted (e.g., [9,9] where [2,9] expected).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 3x11 grid with repeating 8/3 stripes that don't align symmetrically, but expected a cross-like pattern with 8 frames and 3 accents in a mirrored way; difference: output has irregular 3-clumps in rows 1-3, while expected has uniform 8-rows with 3 insertions in row 2; unknown why the vertical tiling didn't capture the horizontal symmetry.
 * Training example 3: Generated a 4x15 grid with scattered 6/4 blocks, but expected a more structured frame with 6 borders and 4 fills in a repeating unit; difference: output rows have mismatched lengths in patterns (e.g., row 0 has 6,4,4,6... but expected row 0 is 6,6,4,4,...), suggesting failed contiguity or wrong motif_len; the +template_main adjustment wasn't triggered correctly.
 * Training example 4: Generated a 2x7 grid with 2/8 in a simple repeat, but expected a full 2-border frame around 8 in row 0; difference: row 0 is [2,8,8,8,2,8,8] (partial frame with extra 8s), row 1 matches exactly—close but overflows the framing rule.
 * extract_panels is essential and mostly correct for splitting, but assumes fixed panel roles (first=template, -2=bg, -1=acc) which holds here but may not if panels vary.
 * Color extraction works in all cases (e.g., 9,3,4,8 correctly pulled).
 * Dimension logic partially works (e.g., out_cross = template_cross - 2 avoids borders), but out_main calculation fails consistently, often ignoring bg/acc contributions properly.
 * Contiguity check is useful but only applied selectively, missing gaps in vertical cases and causing non-contiguous accents to misplace.
 * All attempts miss the puzzle's likely "framing" or "border extension" rule, where bg/acc panels suggest how to extend the template into a larger symmetric structure rather than modular tiling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x4 motif block (two copies of a plus-like pattern with 8 bg and 7 acc) vertically, but it does not look correct—it's overly repetitive and lacks variation, suggesting the program defaulted to horizontal layout and simple % repetition without adapting to the test input's specific template.
 * Expected output likely involves a single extended frame or tiled unit using 8 as bg and 7 as acc in a cross/plus shape extended by bg/acc panel sizes, but generated has stacked duplicates (e.g., lines 0-4 repeat in 5-9) with no dimension adjustment, making it too tall and uniform; this mismatches the training expectations of asymmetric or mirrored extensions.
 * The output ignores potential vertical orientation or contiguity, producing a "wallpaper" effect instead of a puzzle-specific composition; to handle test, need to verify if test input has horizontal/vertical separators and adjust motif to non-modular placement (e.g., direct concatenation or mirroring).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by horizontal or vertical separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), with the first panel serving as a template pattern, the second-to-last panel defining a background color, and the last panel defining an accent color. The goal is to generate an output grid that tiles a motif extracted from the template (using background for certain template values like 4 and accent for others) across a combined main dimension derived from the background and accent panels, minus separators, while preserving the cross dimension minus borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by splitting on full lines of 1s; assume vertical orientation if height > width, using horizontal separators, else horizontal orientation with vertical separators—handle empty or single-panel cases by returning empty output.
 * Template motif is built from the inner area of the template (skipping border rows/columns, indexed from 1), mapping template value 4 to background color and other non-0/1 values to accent color; the motif size is (template_main - 1) by (template_cross - 2).
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2; main dimension is background_main + accent_main - 2 (accounting for shared separators or borders).
 * Tiling repeats the motif along the main dimension by cycling through its rows/columns to fill the full output_main length; orientation matters—vertical means rows are main, columns are cross; horizontal means columns are main, rows are cross.
 * Colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in a panel; if no such value or 0, output is empty.
 * Subtlety: The -2 in main dimension likely subtracts for the two separator lines (one from each panel), but this underestimates in some cases, leading to shorter outputs; ensure tiling covers the exact combined inner sizes without overlap loss.
 * Handle cases where panels have varying inner content (e.g., full-color panels for bg/acc); assume all panels are rectangular and aligned.
 * Easy to miss: Template borders are skipped (outer rows/cols are ignored in motif), and output has no borders (pure tiled motif); if fewer than 4 panels, output empty.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with numbers representing colors; generated outputs must match expected exactly in size and values.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies panels, extracts template/bg/acc, and builds a basic motif for training examples 1 and 4, passing them exactly.
 * For training 2 (horizontal orientation): Generated a 3x6 output, but expected 3x11; the output shows partial tiling of a 3x5 motif (repeating once fully but missing extensions), differing in width (6 vs 11 columns) and missing additional motif cycles in the second and third rows (e.g., expected has extra [8,3,8,8,8] patterns); likely due to underestimating out_main_num = bg_main + acc_main - 2, which didn't account for full combined inner length.
 * For training 3 (vertical orientation): Generated a 4x10 output, but expected 4x15; output tiles a motif partially (repeating ~2 times but truncated), differing in height per row? Wait, no—it's 4 rows x 10 cols vs 4x15, with missing extensions in each row (e.g., first row ends [6,6] but expected continues [4,4,6,6,4]); again, out_main_num too small, causing incomplete cycling along columns.
 * Training 1 and 4 succeeded, suggesting correct motif extraction and basic tiling logic, but scaling fails when bg/acc mains are larger, possibly miscounting inner dimensions (e.g., not subtracting borders correctly for bg/acc).
 * Function get_panel_main is helpful but may be broken: it returns full len(panel) for vertical (rows) but len(panel[0]) for horizontal (cols), without subtracting borders, leading to over-subtraction in out_main_num.
 * Functions like get_template_main_cross correctly skip template borders but assume fixed -1/-2; this works for small cases but not when bg/acc have internal structure.
 * No object extraction needed (grids are abstract colors, not shapes); prior unhelpful ideas like blob detection would be irrelevant here.
 * Subtle issue: In motif building, template indexing starts at +1 for main and +1 for cross, assuming 1-thick borders; if borders vary, this breaks—easy to miss if inputs always have uniform borders.
 * Tiling uses % l for cycling, which is correct but only fills to out_main_num, so root cause is dimension miscalculation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 10x5 grid that repeats a 4-row pattern (two full [8,8,7,8,8]/[8,7,7,7,8]/[8,8,8,8,8]/[7,7,7,7,7] blocks plus a partial third: two more rows), suggesting vertical orientation with cross=5 (template_cross-2? but includes borders?) and main=10, but it looks incorrect because the pattern doesn't align with a clean motif tiling—e.g., the third block starts repeating the first two rows without completing the 4-row motif or matching expected seamless extension; likely same dimension error as training 2/3, under-tiling the full bg+acc main (expected probably longer, like 12-15 rows with full cycles using 7 as acc and 8 as bg). It doesn't make sense as a final puzzle output, as it appears truncated mid-motif, missing the full combined length and possibly inverting bg/acc mapping (e.g., if template has 4s as bg but here 7/8 placement seems off).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract a motif, the second-to-last panel providing the background color, and the last panel providing the accent color. The output is a generated pattern that weaves or repeats the motif from the template (replacing 0s with accent and others with background) into a larger grid, with orientation (vertical or horizontal) determined by whether height exceeds width, leading to row- or column-based panel splitting and motif application.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are split excluding the separator lines themselves (start after previous sep, end before next), but must result in at least 4 panels (template + at least two more for bg/acc) or output empty list.
 * Orientation check (h > w for vertical) dictates separator type: horizontal seps for vertical orientation (splitting rows), vertical seps for horizontal (splitting columns); this affects how the motif is extracted and woven.
 * Template motif extraction excludes border rows/columns (inner start=1 to end-1), replacing 0s with accent color and non-0/1 with background; motif length is inner height/width minus borders, but output dimensions involve (inner_cross * motif_len - 1) for main axis and (inner_cross) for cross axis.
 * Weaving logic shortens the last motif placement (uses motif_len -1 elements in final position) to create an interlocking or overlapping pattern across the cross dimension, avoiding full repetition.
 * Color extraction takes the first non-0/1 value in a panel as the color (assuming uniform); if bg or acc is 0, output empty—subtlety: panels might have mixed cells, but code assumes single color.
 * Empty or invalid templates (e.g., inner cross <=0 or insufficient size) return empty; separators must be full lines of 1s across the relevant axis.
 * Subtle element: Output is always rectangular, but main dimension is reduced by 1 to account for weaving overlap, which could mismatch if motif placement logic errs on boundaries.
 * Across attempts, ensure panel count >=4; training 1 failure suggests mis-split or wrong orientation/motif len for that case, possibly due to separator detection or vertical/horiz swap.
 * Consider grids with uneven panel sizes or partial 1s (but code requires full lines, so invalid seps ignored).

Panel extraction utilities; row-based for vertical orient, col-based for horiz—correctly skips seps and copies subgrids.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set(cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1})
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Simple color pull from non-separator/non-empty cells; assumes single color per panel, helpful but could fail on multi-color (returns first).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 2, 3, and 4 all correct, indicating successful panel splitting, motif extraction, color assignment, and weaving for those cases—likely well-oriented grids with clear seps and valid templates.
 * Training example 1 incorrect: generated 3 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [2,2]) vs. expected 5 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [9,9], [2,2], [2,9])—suggests miscalculation of out_main height (possibly wrong motif_len or out_cross, or incomplete weaving with shortened last motif cutting too much; unknown if orientation was wrong, but effect is truncated output missing two rows with [9,9] pattern).
 * Overall, separator detection and panel extraction worked (got 4+ panels), color get_color succeeded (used 2 as bg?, 9 as acc), but vertical weaving logic failed to produce full expected length/ pattern for train 1—possibly border exclusion or pos increment in motif placement off by 1.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (dimensions, seps, panels, color) are relevant and functional, though weaving in program() body has bugs in dimension calc or loop for certain template sizes.
 * Empty returns on <4 panels or invalid dims worked as safeguard, preventing bad outputs in edge cases.

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 15-row by 5-column grid with repeating 3-row motif: row A [8,8,7,8,8], row B [8,7,7,7,8], row C [8,8,8,8,8], repeated ~5 times but ends abruptly after 14-15 rows without full cycles (listed as A,B,C x4 + A,B).
 * Pattern uses 8 (likely bg) dominant, 7 (likely acc) in "inner" positions of A/B, full 8s in C—suggests horizontal orientation (wide motif), successful color/motif extract, but repetition seems over-long or miscounted (out_main = out_cross * motif_len -1 might yield ~15 if template inner ~3x something, but weaving shortens last, possibly causing incomplete final cycle).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition is uniform but truncated/mismatched length (15 rows uneven for 3-row motif x5=15, but ends on B not C), and if test input expects tighter interlocking (like train1's [9,9] inserts), the full-8 rows might be overused; differs from train1 error by being too long vs. too short, hinting consistent but flawed dimension/weaving formula—account for exact pos increments to avoid partial motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid is divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), and the first panel serves as a template to generate a larger output grid by tiling a motif derived from the template's inner content, using colors extracted from background and accent panels (the second-to-last and last panels). The output orients vertically or horizontally based on the input's aspect ratio, with the motif placing background color where the template has 4s and accent color elsewhere, plus an extra accent column/row for periodicity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are strictly full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical layouts, vertical for horizontal); partial 1s or other values do not count, and empty grids return empty outputs.
 * Orientation is determined by height > width (vertical: row-based panels) vs. otherwise (horizontal: column-based panels), which affects how panels are extracted and how the output is tiled (row-wise vs. column-wise).
 * Panels must be at least 4 for processing; fewer result in empty output—template is first panel, bg is second-last, acc is last; colors are the unique non-0/1 value in bg/acc panels (0 if none).
 * Template processing excludes a 1-cell border (inner_main = main_dim - 2, inner_cross = cross_dim - 2); if either <=0, output is empty.
 * Motif construction: For each inner cross position, fill inner_main positions with bg_color if template inner value ==4, else acc_color; append an extra acc_color position for period = inner_main +1.
 * Output main dimension calculation has a subtlety for horizontal layouts: If all filled slices (where template inner ==4) are contiguous per cross position, out_main = template_main + bg_main + acc_main -2; else out_main = bg_main + acc_main -2 (vertical always uses bg_main + acc_main -2).
 * Tiling wraps the motif periodically along the main dimension (pos = i % period), filling the cross dimension directly from motif.
 * Borders in template/panels are assumed to be 1s or ignored for inner extraction; get_inner_value skips the border by indexing at 1+ offsets.
 * Colors must be non-zero/non-1; if bg or acc color is 0, output empty—ensures valid motif.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal contiguous check only applies if there are filled positions; empty filled slices are okay but don't affect contiguity. Also, panel extraction skips separators (start = sep +1), so panels don't include 1-lines.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 and g[0] else 0
    return w, h  # Returns (width, height); useful for orientation check (h > w -> vertical)
```

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]  # Finds full rows of 1s for vertical layouts

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    h = len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h))]  # Finds full columns of 1s for horizontal layouts
```

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if sep > start:
            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels  # Extracts row-based panels, skipping separators; symmetric get_panel_columns for columns

def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0  # Extracts unique non-border/non-empty color; essential for bg/acc
```

```python
def get_inner_value(temp: List[List[int]], j: int, c: int, is_vertical: bool) -> int:
    if is_vertical:
        return temp[1 + j][1 + c]  # Border skip for vertical template access
    else:
        return temp[1 + c][1 + j]  # Border skip for horizontal template access
# Note: This is derived from the program's logic; useful for motif building without full grid
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the presented attempt (no prior ones shown); it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid grasp of panel splitting, color extraction, motif periodicity, and tiling for both orientations.
 * Worked well: Separator detection accurately splits into panels; color extraction ignores 0/1 borders; inner template processing with 4->bg mapping produces expected motif; contiguity check for horizontal out_main adjustment passed trainings without issues.
 * Did not work/missed: No failures in training, but the horizontal contiguity logic (filled slices must be contiguous per cross position) is only used if slices are non-empty—could miss cases where template has no 4s at all (falls back to bg+acc-2, which worked for trainings).
 * get_dimensions, find_separators, get_panel_rows/columns, and get_color are essential and correct; they robustly handle empty/edge cases.
 * The program's get_panel_main (len(pan) or len(pan[0])) is helpful for dimension extraction but assumes non-empty panels—could fail silently if panels are empty (returns 0, leading to empty output, which is safe).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the contiguity check's get_filled_for_slice is specific to horizontal and could be generalized but isn't broken.
 * Trainings all correct, so no mismatches in blob shapes, omissions, or divider issues; unknown if trainings had contiguous vs. non-contiguous cases, but it handled them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, 5 columns each) with a clear repeating pattern: three row types cycle ( [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8] ) followed by [7,7,7,7,7], repeating the first three twice more, suggesting horizontal orientation with period=4 (inner_main=3 +1), out_cross=5, and out_main=10 (possibly from contiguity allowing template_main + bg + acc -2).
 * It makes sense as a tiled motif: Columns 1-5 show varying 7/8 placements, with full 8-row and full 7-row insertions, aligning with accent/bg colors (assuming 7=acc, 8=bg) and periodic filling where template inners dictate positions.
 * Looks correct based on rules—no empty output despite complex dims, pattern repeats consistently without gaps/overlaps, and includes full accent rows (all 7s) as expected from bg/acc panels; no obvious differences from expected (e.g., no missing borders or wrong periodicity), but without test input grid, can't confirm exact panel splits or colors—assume matches since trainings passed.
 * Subtle: The output has 3 full cycles minus one, with inserted all-7 and all-8 rows; if test input had non-contiguous 4s, it correctly used shorter out_main, but pattern suggests contiguity was true.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:29:26] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid divided into panels by separator lines of 1s, using the first panel as a template to extract a motif (where 4 indicates background color placement, and other values indicate accent), deriving background and accent colors from the second-to-last and last panels, and generating a repeating striped or tiled output pattern based on the grid's orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal). The output extends the motif horizontally or vertically to a length derived from the background and accent panel dimensions, potentially adjusted for contiguity in motifs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid orientation determines separator search: horizontal separators (full rows of 1s) for vertical layouts (h > w), vertical separators (full columns of 1s) for horizontal layouts (h <= w).
 * Panels are extracted between separators; requires at least 4 panels (template, at least one middle, bg, acc); bg_panel is second-to-last, acc_panel is last.
 * Template uses inner area (border of 1 cell stripped), where cells ==4 map to bg_color, other non-0/1 map to acc_color; motif per cross-dimension slice appends one acc_color.
 * Colors extracted from bg_panel and acc_panel as the unique non-0/1 value; fail if 0.
 * Output dimensions: main dimension extended to out_main = bg_main + acc_main - 2 (or + template_main if motifs are contiguous in horizontal case); cross dimension is template_cross - 2.
 * Contiguity check (horizontal only): for each cross-slice, positions where template==4 must form a single contiguous block (no gaps); if all slices contiguous, extend out_main by template's main_dim (subtle hack to handle repeating full template periods?).
 * Inner dimensions must be >=2 after border strip; output is empty list if invalid (e.g., <4 panels, invalid colors/dims).
 * Motif repetition uses modulo period (motif length) to tile along main dimension.
 * Subtle: separators include the lines themselves (panels exclude them); empty panels possible but lead to failures.
 * Borders in template are assumed 1-cell thick; no handling for irregular borders or non-1 separators.
 * Vertical output: list of lists with height=out_main, width=inner_cross; horizontal: height=inner_cross, width=out_main.
 * Potential misses: non-square panels, varying panel heights/widths across, motif with all 4s or no 4s, colors >1 but not unique per panel.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; successfully passed all 4 training examples (generated correct outputs matching expected patterns).
 * Panel extraction and separator detection worked reliably for training cases, correctly identifying template, bg, and acc panels.
 * Motif extraction and color mapping (4->bg, other->acc, append acc) functioned as intended for vertical and horizontal orientations in training.
 * Contiguity check and out_main extension (in horizontal case) did not trigger issues in training but may be a fragile adjustment for specific motif continuity.
 * No prior unhelpful functions; all provided (e.g., get_dimensions, find_separators) are essential for parsing and are not broken, though contiguity logic is subtle/ad-hoc and could miss non-contiguous motifs that should still tile.
 * Training successes suggest core logic (repeating motif tiling) aligns with puzzle, but no details on why training grids/orientations succeeded (e.g., all vertical? all contiguous?).

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 10-row by 5-column grid using colors 7 (likely bg) and 8 (likely acc), showing a repeating pattern: rows 1/5/9: [8,8,7,8,8]; rows 2/6/10: [8,7,7,7,8]; rows 3/7: [8,8,8,8,8]; rows 4/8: [7,7,7,7,7]; partial repeat to row 10.
 * Output dimensions (h=10 > w=5) suggest horizontal input layout (is_vertical=False), with inner_cross=5 (full width, no strip?), out_main=10; pattern implies motif length=4 per column (e.g., col0: 8,8,8,7 repeating; col1: 8,7,8,7; etc.), with possible contiguity-triggered extension (out_main += main_dim, making longer repeat).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition seems consistent with code's modulo tiling but truncated at 10 rows (expected full periods?); inner_cross=5 suggests no border strip or cross_dim=7, but pattern has non-uniform motifs (e.g., col2 mostly 7/8 but shifted), which may mismatch if template inner expects stripped borders—possible over-extension from contiguity or incorrect panel dims.
 * Difference from expected: without test input grid, hard to verify motif source, but output lacks clear full-period closure (ends mid-repeat at row10), and uniform row4/8 (all 7s) vs. varied others suggests acc/border bleed; if expected is shorter/tighter tiling (e.g., 8 rows), the +main_dim extension may have over-lengthened; it's different in lacking symmetry or exact period match to a simple motif append.
 * Makes partial sense (plausible color tiling) but likely incorrect due to dimension/extension bugs—e.g., why 10 rows specifically? (bg_main + acc_main -2 + main_dim=10?); need to validate against test input's panel sizes/motifs.

[2025-09-30 20:29:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

    if orientation == 'vertical':
        seps = find_horizontal_separators(g)
        return get_panel_rows(g, seps)
    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)
```
(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, where the first panel serves as a template pattern (with 4s indicating filled positions and 1s as borders), the second-to-last panel provides a background color, and the last panel provides an accent color; the goal is to generate a larger output grid that tiles or extends the template's motif using the accent color on a background, adjusting dimensions based on panel sizes and orientation (vertical or horizontal layout).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by rows or columns entirely filled with 1s; the code assumes horizontal separators if height > width, vertical otherwise, but this may not always hold if the grid is square or if separators are mixed.
 * Template panel uses 4 as a fill marker for the motif pattern, with 1s as borders; the motif is extracted as contiguous filled positions per "slice" (column if vertical, row if horizontal), and it's repeated with a motif_len = template_main - 1, but this repetition logic fails when the pattern isn't strictly periodic or when slices have non-contiguous fills.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in their panels; if missing (returns 0), output is empty, which is a safeguard but may skip valid cases.
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2 (removing borders), main dimension varies— for vertical: bg_main + acc_main - 2; for horizontal non-contiguous: same, but for horizontal contiguous: bg_main + acc_main + template_main - 2—which introduces inconsistencies and likely causes dimension mismatches.
 * Motif application: accent is placed in output where i % motif_len matches filled positions in template slices; this assumes a simple modular repetition, but puzzles may require mirroring, scaling, or combining bg/acc patterns differently (e.g., bg and acc influencing motif density or position).
 * Contiguity check: Ensures filled positions in each slice are consecutive without gaps; if not, adjusts out_main, but this is only applied in horizontal case, leading to asymmetric handling.
 * Edge cases: Empty panels, zero dimensions, or no 4s in template lead to empty output; color extraction ignores 0/1 but assumes exactly one other color per panel.
 * Orientation matters: Vertical layout treats rows as main dimension, columns as cross; swapping may be needed if initial assumption fails.
 * Subtle: Outputs must match exact expected grids, including size and values; even small shifts in motif placement or dimension calculation cause full mismatches.
 * All training examples show pattern inversion or misalignment (e.g., expected symmetric frames become offset repeats), suggesting the tiling/repetition doesn't capture the puzzle's "framing" or "mirroring" rule.

These functions are solid for panel extraction and color detection but need refinement in motif tiling logic. The contiguity check in the original is helpful for detecting gaps but is inconsistently applied.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The motif application loop in the original (using i % motif_len in filled_set) is broken—it produces offset or incomplete repeats, as seen in all examples; avoid direct reuse without fixing the periodicity or mirroring. The dimension calculation for out_main is inconsistent and often undersizes/oversizes the output, leading to shape mismatches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, panel extraction via separators works partially, correctly identifying template, bg_panel, and acc_panel in structure, but fails to generate the correct tiled pattern.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 5x2 grid with alternating 2/9 rows in a zigzag, but expected a framed pattern with 2 borders around 9 centers in columns; difference: motif repetition created vertical stripes instead of horizontal framing, and dimensions matched but content was inverted (e.g., [9,9] where [2,9] expected).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 3x11 grid with repeating 8/3 stripes that don't align symmetrically, but expected a cross-like pattern with 8 frames and 3 accents in a mirrored way; difference: output has irregular 3-clumps in rows 1-3, while expected has uniform 8-rows with 3 insertions in row 2; unknown why the vertical tiling didn't capture the horizontal symmetry.
 * Training example 3: Generated a 4x15 grid with scattered 6/4 blocks, but expected a more structured frame with 6 borders and 4 fills in a repeating unit; difference: output rows have mismatched lengths in patterns (e.g., row 0 has 6,4,4,6... but expected row 0 is 6,6,4,4,...), suggesting failed contiguity or wrong motif_len; the +template_main adjustment wasn't triggered correctly.
 * Training example 4: Generated a 2x7 grid with 2/8 in a simple repeat, but expected a full 2-border frame around 8 in row 0; difference: row 0 is [2,8,8,8,2,8,8] (partial frame with extra 8s), row 1 matches exactly—close but overflows the framing rule.
 * extract_panels is essential and mostly correct for splitting, but assumes fixed panel roles (first=template, -2=bg, -1=acc) which holds here but may not if panels vary.
 * Color extraction works in all cases (e.g., 9,3,4,8 correctly pulled).
 * Dimension logic partially works (e.g., out_cross = template_cross - 2 avoids borders), but out_main calculation fails consistently, often ignoring bg/acc contributions properly.
 * Contiguity check is useful but only applied selectively, missing gaps in vertical cases and causing non-contiguous accents to misplace.
 * All attempts miss the puzzle's likely "framing" or "border extension" rule, where bg/acc panels suggest how to extend the template into a larger symmetric structure rather than modular tiling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x4 motif block (two copies of a plus-like pattern with 8 bg and 7 acc) vertically, but it does not look correct—it's overly repetitive and lacks variation, suggesting the program defaulted to horizontal layout and simple % repetition without adapting to the test input's specific template.
 * Expected output likely involves a single extended frame or tiled unit using 8 as bg and 7 as acc in a cross/plus shape extended by bg/acc panel sizes, but generated has stacked duplicates (e.g., lines 0-4 repeat in 5-9) with no dimension adjustment, making it too tall and uniform; this mismatches the training expectations of asymmetric or mirrored extensions.
 * The output ignores potential vertical orientation or contiguity, producing a "wallpaper" effect instead of a puzzle-specific composition; to handle test, need to verify if test input has horizontal/vertical separators and adjust motif to non-modular placement (e.g., direct concatenation or mirroring).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by horizontal or vertical separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), with the first panel serving as a template pattern, the second-to-last panel defining a background color, and the last panel defining an accent color. The goal is to generate an output grid that tiles a motif extracted from the template (using background for certain template values like 4 and accent for others) across a combined main dimension derived from the background and accent panels, minus separators, while preserving the cross dimension minus borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by splitting on full lines of 1s; assume vertical orientation if height > width, using horizontal separators, else horizontal orientation with vertical separators—handle empty or single-panel cases by returning empty output.
 * Template motif is built from the inner area of the template (skipping border rows/columns, indexed from 1), mapping template value 4 to background color and other non-0/1 values to accent color; the motif size is (template_main - 1) by (template_cross - 2).
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2; main dimension is background_main + accent_main - 2 (accounting for shared separators or borders).
 * Tiling repeats the motif along the main dimension by cycling through its rows/columns to fill the full output_main length; orientation matters—vertical means rows are main, columns are cross; horizontal means columns are main, rows are cross.
 * Colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in a panel; if no such value or 0, output is empty.
 * Subtlety: The -2 in main dimension likely subtracts for the two separator lines (one from each panel), but this underestimates in some cases, leading to shorter outputs; ensure tiling covers the exact combined inner sizes without overlap loss.
 * Handle cases where panels have varying inner content (e.g., full-color panels for bg/acc); assume all panels are rectangular and aligned.
 * Easy to miss: Template borders are skipped (outer rows/cols are ignored in motif), and output has no borders (pure tiled motif); if fewer than 4 panels, output empty.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with numbers representing colors; generated outputs must match expected exactly in size and values.

        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)  # Core function to split grid into panels based on orientation
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies panels, extracts template/bg/acc, and builds a basic motif for training examples 1 and 4, passing them exactly.
 * For training 2 (horizontal orientation): Generated a 3x6 output, but expected 3x11; the output shows partial tiling of a 3x5 motif (repeating once fully but missing extensions), differing in width (6 vs 11 columns) and missing additional motif cycles in the second and third rows (e.g., expected has extra [8,3,8,8,8] patterns); likely due to underestimating out_main_num = bg_main + acc_main - 2, which didn't account for full combined inner length.
 * For training 3 (vertical orientation): Generated a 4x10 output, but expected 4x15; output tiles a motif partially (repeating ~2 times but truncated), differing in height per row? Wait, no—it's 4 rows x 10 cols vs 4x15, with missing extensions in each row (e.g., first row ends [6,6] but expected continues [4,4,6,6,4]); again, out_main_num too small, causing incomplete cycling along columns.
 * Training 1 and 4 succeeded, suggesting correct motif extraction and basic tiling logic, but scaling fails when bg/acc mains are larger, possibly miscounting inner dimensions (e.g., not subtracting borders correctly for bg/acc).
 * Function get_panel_main is helpful but may be broken: it returns full len(panel) for vertical (rows) but len(panel[0]) for horizontal (cols), without subtracting borders, leading to over-subtraction in out_main_num.
 * Functions like get_template_main_cross correctly skip template borders but assume fixed -1/-2; this works for small cases but not when bg/acc have internal structure.
 * No object extraction needed (grids are abstract colors, not shapes); prior unhelpful ideas like blob detection would be irrelevant here.
 * Subtle issue: In motif building, template indexing starts at +1 for main and +1 for cross, assuming 1-thick borders; if borders vary, this breaks—easy to miss if inputs always have uniform borders.
 * Tiling uses % l for cycling, which is correct but only fills to out_main_num, so root cause is dimension miscalculation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 10x5 grid that repeats a 4-row pattern (two full [8,8,7,8,8]/[8,7,7,7,8]/[8,8,8,8,8]/[7,7,7,7,7] blocks plus a partial third: two more rows), suggesting vertical orientation with cross=5 (template_cross-2? but includes borders?) and main=10, but it looks incorrect because the pattern doesn't align with a clean motif tiling—e.g., the third block starts repeating the first two rows without completing the 4-row motif or matching expected seamless extension; likely same dimension error as training 2/3, under-tiling the full bg+acc main (expected probably longer, like 12-15 rows with full cycles using 7 as acc and 8 as bg). It doesn't make sense as a final puzzle output, as it appears truncated mid-motif, missing the full combined length and possibly inverting bg/acc mapping (e.g., if template has 4s as bg but here 7/8 placement seems off).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract a motif, the second-to-last panel providing the background color, and the last panel providing the accent color. The output is a generated pattern that weaves or repeats the motif from the template (replacing 0s with accent and others with background) into a larger grid, with orientation (vertical or horizontal) determined by whether height exceeds width, leading to row- or column-based panel splitting and motif application.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are split excluding the separator lines themselves (start after previous sep, end before next), but must result in at least 4 panels (template + at least two more for bg/acc) or output empty list.
 * Orientation check (h > w for vertical) dictates separator type: horizontal seps for vertical orientation (splitting rows), vertical seps for horizontal (splitting columns); this affects how the motif is extracted and woven.
 * Template motif extraction excludes border rows/columns (inner start=1 to end-1), replacing 0s with accent color and non-0/1 with background; motif length is inner height/width minus borders, but output dimensions involve (inner_cross * motif_len - 1) for main axis and (inner_cross) for cross axis.
 * Weaving logic shortens the last motif placement (uses motif_len -1 elements in final position) to create an interlocking or overlapping pattern across the cross dimension, avoiding full repetition.
 * Color extraction takes the first non-0/1 value in a panel as the color (assuming uniform); if bg or acc is 0, output empty—subtlety: panels might have mixed cells, but code assumes single color.
 * Empty or invalid templates (e.g., inner cross <=0 or insufficient size) return empty; separators must be full lines of 1s across the relevant axis.
 * Subtle element: Output is always rectangular, but main dimension is reduced by 1 to account for weaving overlap, which could mismatch if motif placement logic errs on boundaries.
 * Across attempts, ensure panel count >=4; training 1 failure suggests mis-split or wrong orientation/motif len for that case, possibly due to separator detection or vertical/horiz swap.
 * Consider grids with uneven panel sizes or partial 1s (but code requires full lines, so invalid seps ignored).

Panel extraction utilities; row-based for vertical orient, col-based for horiz—correctly skips seps and copies subgrids.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set(cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1})
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Simple color pull from non-separator/non-empty cells; assumes single color per panel, helpful but could fail on multi-color (returns first).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 2, 3, and 4 all correct, indicating successful panel splitting, motif extraction, color assignment, and weaving for those cases—likely well-oriented grids with clear seps and valid templates.
 * Training example 1 incorrect: generated 3 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [2,2]) vs. expected 5 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [9,9], [2,2], [2,9])—suggests miscalculation of out_main height (possibly wrong motif_len or out_cross, or incomplete weaving with shortened last motif cutting too much; unknown if orientation was wrong, but effect is truncated output missing two rows with [9,9] pattern).
 * Overall, separator detection and panel extraction worked (got 4+ panels), color get_color succeeded (used 2 as bg?, 9 as acc), but vertical weaving logic failed to produce full expected length/ pattern for train 1—possibly border exclusion or pos increment in motif placement off by 1.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (dimensions, seps, panels, color) are relevant and functional, though weaving in program() body has bugs in dimension calc or loop for certain template sizes.
 * Empty returns on <4 panels or invalid dims worked as safeguard, preventing bad outputs in edge cases.

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 15-row by 5-column grid with repeating 3-row motif: row A [8,8,7,8,8], row B [8,7,7,7,8], row C [8,8,8,8,8], repeated ~5 times but ends abruptly after 14-15 rows without full cycles (listed as A,B,C x4 + A,B).
 * Pattern uses 8 (likely bg) dominant, 7 (likely acc) in "inner" positions of A/B, full 8s in C—suggests horizontal orientation (wide motif), successful color/motif extract, but repetition seems over-long or miscounted (out_main = out_cross * motif_len -1 might yield ~15 if template inner ~3x something, but weaving shortens last, possibly causing incomplete final cycle).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition is uniform but truncated/mismatched length (15 rows uneven for 3-row motif x5=15, but ends on B not C), and if test input expects tighter interlocking (like train1's [9,9] inserts), the full-8 rows might be overused; differs from train1 error by being too long vs. too short, hinting consistent but flawed dimension/weaving formula—account for exact pos increments to avoid partial motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid divided into panels by separator lines of 1s, using the first panel as a template to extract a motif (where 4 indicates background color placement, and other values indicate accent), deriving background and accent colors from the second-to-last and last panels, and generating a repeating striped or tiled output pattern based on the grid's orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal). The output extends the motif horizontally or vertically to a length derived from the background and accent panel dimensions, potentially adjusted for contiguity in motifs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid orientation determines separator search: horizontal separators (full rows of 1s) for vertical layouts (h > w), vertical separators (full columns of 1s) for horizontal layouts (h <= w).
 * Panels are extracted between separators; requires at least 4 panels (template, at least one middle, bg, acc); bg_panel is second-to-last, acc_panel is last.
 * Template uses inner area (border of 1 cell stripped), where cells ==4 map to bg_color, other non-0/1 map to acc_color; motif per cross-dimension slice appends one acc_color.
 * Colors extracted from bg_panel and acc_panel as the unique non-0/1 value; fail if 0.
 * Output dimensions: main dimension extended to out_main = bg_main + acc_main - 2 (or + template_main if motifs are contiguous in horizontal case); cross dimension is template_cross - 2.
 * Contiguity check (horizontal only): for each cross-slice, positions where template==4 must form a single contiguous block (no gaps); if all slices contiguous, extend out_main by template's main_dim (subtle hack to handle repeating full template periods?).
 * Inner dimensions must be >=2 after border strip; output is empty list if invalid (e.g., <4 panels, invalid colors/dims).
 * Motif repetition uses modulo period (motif length) to tile along main dimension.
 * Subtle: separators include the lines themselves (panels exclude them); empty panels possible but lead to failures.
 * Borders in template are assumed 1-cell thick; no handling for irregular borders or non-1 separators.
 * Vertical output: list of lists with height=out_main, width=inner_cross; horizontal: height=inner_cross, width=out_main.
 * Potential misses: non-square panels, varying panel heights/widths across, motif with all 4s or no 4s, colors >1 but not unique per panel.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; successfully passed all 4 training examples (generated correct outputs matching expected patterns).
 * Panel extraction and separator detection worked reliably for training cases, correctly identifying template, bg, and acc panels.
 * Motif extraction and color mapping (4->bg, other->acc, append acc) functioned as intended for vertical and horizontal orientations in training.
 * Contiguity check and out_main extension (in horizontal case) did not trigger issues in training but may be a fragile adjustment for specific motif continuity.
 * No prior unhelpful functions; all provided (e.g., get_dimensions, find_separators) are essential for parsing and are not broken, though contiguity logic is subtle/ad-hoc and could miss non-contiguous motifs that should still tile.
 * Training successes suggest core logic (repeating motif tiling) aligns with puzzle, but no details on why training grids/orientations succeeded (e.g., all vertical? all contiguous?).

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 10-row by 5-column grid using colors 7 (likely bg) and 8 (likely acc), showing a repeating pattern: rows 1/5/9: [8,8,7,8,8]; rows 2/6/10: [8,7,7,7,8]; rows 3/7: [8,8,8,8,8]; rows 4/8: [7,7,7,7,7]; partial repeat to row 10.
 * Output dimensions (h=10 > w=5) suggest horizontal input layout (is_vertical=False), with inner_cross=5 (full width, no strip?), out_main=10; pattern implies motif length=4 per column (e.g., col0: 8,8,8,7 repeating; col1: 8,7,8,7; etc.), with possible contiguity-triggered extension (out_main += main_dim, making longer repeat).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition seems consistent with code's modulo tiling but truncated at 10 rows (expected full periods?); inner_cross=5 suggests no border strip or cross_dim=7, but pattern has non-uniform motifs (e.g., col2 mostly 7/8 but shifted), which may mismatch if template inner expects stripped borders—possible over-extension from contiguity or incorrect panel dims.
 * Difference from expected: without test input grid, hard to verify motif source, but output lacks clear full-period closure (ends mid-repeat at row10), and uniform row4/8 (all 7s) vs. varied others suggests acc/border bleed; if expected is shorter/tighter tiling (e.g., 8 rows), the +main_dim extension may have over-lengthened; it's different in lacking symmetry or exact period match to a simple motif append.
 * Makes partial sense (plausible color tiling) but likely incorrect due to dimension/extension bugs—e.g., why 10 rows specifically? (bg_main + acc_main -2 + main_dim=10?); need to validate against test input's panel sizes/motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid is divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), and the first panel serves as a template to generate a larger output grid by tiling a motif derived from the template's inner content, using colors extracted from background and accent panels (the second-to-last and last panels). The output orients vertically or horizontally based on the input's aspect ratio, with the motif placing background color where the template has 4s and accent color elsewhere, plus an extra accent column/row for periodicity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are strictly full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical layouts, vertical for horizontal); partial 1s or other values do not count, and empty grids return empty outputs.
 * Orientation is determined by height > width (vertical: row-based panels) vs. otherwise (horizontal: column-based panels), which affects how panels are extracted and how the output is tiled (row-wise vs. column-wise).
 * Panels must be at least 4 for processing; fewer result in empty output—template is first panel, bg is second-last, acc is last; colors are the unique non-0/1 value in bg/acc panels (0 if none).
 * Template processing excludes a 1-cell border (inner_main = main_dim - 2, inner_cross = cross_dim - 2); if either <=0, output is empty.
 * Motif construction: For each inner cross position, fill inner_main positions with bg_color if template inner value ==4, else acc_color; append an extra acc_color position for period = inner_main +1.
 * Output main dimension calculation has a subtlety for horizontal layouts: If all filled slices (where template inner ==4) are contiguous per cross position, out_main = template_main + bg_main + acc_main -2; else out_main = bg_main + acc_main -2 (vertical always uses bg_main + acc_main -2).
 * Tiling wraps the motif periodically along the main dimension (pos = i % period), filling the cross dimension directly from motif.
 * Borders in template/panels are assumed to be 1s or ignored for inner extraction; get_inner_value skips the border by indexing at 1+ offsets.
 * Colors must be non-zero/non-1; if bg or acc color is 0, output empty—ensures valid motif.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal contiguous check only applies if there are filled positions; empty filled slices are okay but don't affect contiguity. Also, panel extraction skips separators (start = sep +1), so panels don't include 1-lines.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the presented attempt (no prior ones shown); it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid grasp of panel splitting, color extraction, motif periodicity, and tiling for both orientations.
 * Worked well: Separator detection accurately splits into panels; color extraction ignores 0/1 borders; inner template processing with 4->bg mapping produces expected motif; contiguity check for horizontal out_main adjustment passed trainings without issues.
 * Did not work/missed: No failures in training, but the horizontal contiguity logic (filled slices must be contiguous per cross position) is only used if slices are non-empty—could miss cases where template has no 4s at all (falls back to bg+acc-2, which worked for trainings).
 * get_dimensions, find_separators, get_panel_rows/columns, and get_color are essential and correct; they robustly handle empty/edge cases.
 * The program's get_panel_main (len(pan) or len(pan[0])) is helpful for dimension extraction but assumes non-empty panels—could fail silently if panels are empty (returns 0, leading to empty output, which is safe).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the contiguity check's get_filled_for_slice is specific to horizontal and could be generalized but isn't broken.
 * Trainings all correct, so no mismatches in blob shapes, omissions, or divider issues; unknown if trainings had contiguous vs. non-contiguous cases, but it handled them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, 5 columns each) with a clear repeating pattern: three row types cycle ( [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8] ) followed by [7,7,7,7,7], repeating the first three twice more, suggesting horizontal orientation with period=4 (inner_main=3 +1), out_cross=5, and out_main=10 (possibly from contiguity allowing template_main + bg + acc -2).
 * It makes sense as a tiled motif: Columns 1-5 show varying 7/8 placements, with full 8-row and full 7-row insertions, aligning with accent/bg colors (assuming 7=acc, 8=bg) and periodic filling where template inners dictate positions.
 * Looks correct based on rules—no empty output despite complex dims, pattern repeats consistently without gaps/overlaps, and includes full accent rows (all 7s) as expected from bg/acc panels; no obvious differences from expected (e.g., no missing borders or wrong periodicity), but without test input grid, can't confirm exact panel splits or colors—assume matches since trainings passed.
 * Subtle: The output has 3 full cycles minus one, with inserted all-7 and all-8 rows; if test input had non-contiguous 4s, it correctly used shorter out_main, but pattern suggests contiguity was true.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:35:30] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for a repeating motif, the second-to-last panel provides a background color, and the last panel provides an accent color; the program extracts these, builds a motif by mapping template values (replacing 4s with background or accent), checks for contiguity in the template, and tiles the motif into a new output grid oriented vertically or horizontally based on the input's aspect ratio.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s; horizontal separators for vertical inputs (taller than wide) and vertical for horizontal inputs (wider than tall).
 * Template motif is extracted from slices (columns or rows) excluding borders, replacing 4s with background color and others with accent; motifs are repeated to fill the output.
 * Output dimensions derive from template's main/cross sizes, adjusted by background and accent panel sizes (subtracting 2 for borders), with an additional contiguity check for horizontal inputs to extend the main dimension.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values from panels; if panels lack valid colors or insufficient panels (<4), output empty grid.
 * Subtle: Contiguity check ensures filled positions (4s) in template slices form unbroken segments without gaps; only applied in non-vertical case.
 * Motif length is main-1 (excluding border), and tiling uses modulo for repetition; output is initialized to 0s and filled column/row-wise.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; invalid dimensions or separators lead to empty output; assumes consistent panel widths/heights.
 * Vertical vs. horizontal detection uses h > w; output orientation flips accordingly (e.g., vertical input produces row-wise motif filling).

 * This attempt (the only one provided) successfully passed all 4 training examples, indicating correct handling of panel extraction, color mapping, contiguity checks, and motif tiling for standard cases.
 * Worked well for vertical and horizontal orientations, separator detection, and basic motif repetition.
 * The contiguity check and main dimension extension for horizontal inputs appear functional based on training success.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety: assumes exactly 4+ panels with template first and last two as color sources; may fail if panel count or structure varies.
 * Functions like extract_panels, get_color, and build_motif are essential and correct for core logic.
 * are_all_contiguous is helpful but only used in non-vertical case; could be unhelpful or overly restrictive if puzzle allows gaps in some cases (unknown without expected test output).
 * get_dimensions and separator finders are solid and reusable; no breakage observed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, 5 columns) with a repeating pattern of 7s and 8s: it tiles three blocks of 3 rows each (with a 1-row separator-like pattern of all 8s or 7s), specifically alternating motifs like borders of 8s with inner 7s, and a full row of 7s as dividers.
 * This looks plausible and correct as a motif-tiled output: it matches the code's logic of repeating slices (e.g., motifs derived from template slices filled with bg=7, acc=8 or similar), with repetition every 4 rows (3 motif + 1 divider), and consistent column patterns suggesting horizontal input orientation with cross=5 (out_cross=3 slices) and extended main dimension.
 * No obvious errors; the pattern is symmetric and contiguous, aligning with contiguity check; if the test input has a template with 4s in positions mapping to 7/8, this would match expected tiling without gaps.
 * Subtle match: The output's repeating blocks (e.g., rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-9 partial) suggest motif_len=3 (main-1=4? but adjusted), and full 7-row or 8-row lines as derived from bg/acc panels; it makes sense for the puzzle rules without known deviations.

[2025-09-30 20:35:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s (separators), using a template panel to extract a motif, and a background (bg) and accent (acc) color from later panels to generate a tiled output pattern that repeats the motif in a larger grid, with orientation determined by grid dimensions. The goal is to produce a specific patterned output that matches the expected visual design, but the current program fails to correctly identify panels, extract motifs, or tile them properly across all examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical) of 1s that divide the grid into at least 4 panels; the program correctly identifies them but assumes the first panel is always the template, second-last is bg, and last is acc, which may not hold if panel order or content varies.
 * Orientation is decided by comparing height (h) to width (w), defaulting to vertical if h > w, but this might misclassify grids where separators are not aligned with the longer dimension, leading to incorrect panel splitting (e.g., using row-based vs. column-based extraction).
 * Motif extraction from the template looks for positions where cells == 4 (assuming 4 marks the pattern), then tiles by modulo repetition along the main dimension, offsetting by +1 in cross-dimension, but this offset and the -2 subtractions for dimensions seem arbitrary and fail to match expected shapes/sizes.
 * Background and accent colors are extracted by finding non-0/1 values in panels, but if panels have mixed colors or no unique color, it defaults to 0, causing empty outputs; subtlety: colors might be consistent per panel but the program doesn't validate panel uniformity.
 * Output grid size is derived as (cross_dim - 2) by (bg_len + acc_len - 2) or similar, but this undersizes or distorts the grid, ignoring how the motif should expand to fill a larger repeating structure that matches the expected row/column counts.
 * Panels must have exactly 4 or more for processing, but if fewer, it returns empty; easy to miss: separators might include borders or multiple lines, and panels could be empty/thin, requiring handling of start/end edges.
 * Tiling applies acc only to motif positions, filling rest with bg, but direction (row-major vs. column-major) and modulo wrapping don't align with expected patterns, which often show symmetric or extended repetitions rather than strict offsets.
 * Subtle element: The motif might need inversion, rotation, or combination from multiple panels (not just the first), and colors like 2,3,7,8,9 suggest specific palettes per example, but the program doesn't adapt to varying color sets.
 * Grid might have 0s as empty space, 1s as separators, and higher numbers as colors/objects; ensure no bleed-over when slicing panels.
 * Expected outputs are often longer/wider than input, indicating expansion; current code produces mismatched dimensions (e.g., 5x2 vs. expected 5x5 in train1).

    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies separators and splits panels in basic cases, but fails to handle orientation properly, leading to vertical assumption where horizontal splitting is needed (e.g., train2/3 expect wider outputs).
 * Panel assignment (template=first, bg=second-last, acc=last) works if >=4 panels but doesn't validate content; in all trains, this leads to wrong colors or empty panels, causing undersized or zero outputs.
 * Motif extraction via cells==4 is a good start but the +1 offset and modulo tiling produce distorted repetitions; train1 generates a 5x2 grid with swapped 9/2 positions vs. expected 5x5 with diagonal pattern.
 * Dimension calculations (e.g., out_cross = cross_dim - 2, out_main = bg_len + acc_len - 2) consistently undersize the output; train1: expected 5 rows x 5 cols but got 5x2; train2: expected 3x11 but got 3x6 with incomplete tiling.
 * Tiling logic applies acc in columns for vertical but ignores full motif shape; train3: generated 4x10 irregular but expected 4x15 with symmetric 4/6 blocks; train4: generated 2x7 but expected 2x7 shape mismatch in positions (e.g., 8s not aligned).
 * All trains incorrect due to rigid orientation check (h>w -> vertical) which misfires on non-square grids; no handling for multiple motifs or color blending.
 * get_block_length is helpful for dims but orientation param is confusing and leads to errors in cross/main calc.
 * Overall, structure is promising (separators -> panels -> extract -> tile) but logic for expansion/repetition is broken, producing partial or rotated patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x5 cross-like pattern (with 7s as acc in center arms, 8s as bg) twice vertically, but this looks incorrect as it doubles the input height without width expansion, suggesting over-reliance on vertical orientation and modulo tiling without proper motif scaling.
 * It does not match likely expected logic: test input seems to have a central 7-pattern on 8-bg, so output should probably tile a larger symmetric or extended version (e.g., 5x15 or similar wide repetition), not a simple stack; the repetition ignores separator implications for multi-panel motif.
 * Missing subtlety: If test has horizontal separators, vertical tiling warps it; output has uniform rows which feels too repetitive without variation, unlike trains' expected asymmetric designs—likely wrong because it doesn't expand cross-dimension as in train2/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where one panel serves as a template to extract a motif of filled positions, and the output is a new grid constructed by repeating that motif using background and accent colors derived from other panels. The puzzle emphasizes orientation (vertical vs. horizontal based on grid dimensions), motif periodicity, and precise placement of colors without separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s (horizontal separators for vertical orientation, vertical for horizontal), but the code assumes orientation strictly by h > w, which may fail if grids are square or near-square.
 * Template panel (assumed panels[0]) defines a motif based on positions filled with a specific value (e.g., 4 in get_filled_pos), but the motif length is set to template_main - 1, which undercounts periodicity and leads to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted from panels[2] and [3] as the non-0/1 color, but this assumes panels are uniform-color blocks, ignoring potential multi-color or patterned panels.
 * Motif building checks for contiguous fills but places accents only in gaps or modulo positions, which fails for non-contiguous or wrapped patterns, resulting in uniform or incorrectly spaced outputs.
 * Output dimensions are derived by subtracting 2 from template cross/main (possibly for borders), but this arbitrarily shrinks the grid and ignores panel[1]'s role (e.g., adding its length in horizontal cases only if p1m >=7, which is an ad-hoc hack).
 * Subtlety: Outputs should replicate the motif's structure exactly, including any internal patterns or shifts, but the code repeats the motif row-wise/column-wise without preserving relative positions from the template.
 * Easy to miss: Filled positions use a hardcoded fill_value=4, which may not match all examples (e.g., if templates use different indicators like 3 or 9); also, no handling for empty panels or fewer than 4 panels.
 * Contiguity check in build_motif assumes linear blocks but doesn't handle diagonal or scattered fills, leading to background-filling where accents should appear.
 * Orientation flip in get_block_length and get_filled_pos is inconsistent for cross vs. main dimensions, causing swapped row/column access in outputs.

    orientation = 'vertical' if h > w else 'horizontal'
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        seps = find_horizontal_separators(g)
        return get_panel_rows(g, seps)
    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)
```
(Note: These panel extraction functions are helpful for dividing the grid but assume correct orientation; they work well if separators are clean lines of 1s.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(This is useful for extracting uniform non-separator colors from color panels but fails if panels have mixed colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed, indicating fundamental issues in motif extraction and output construction.
 * Train 1: Generated a 5x2 vertical grid with [2,2] in most rows and [2,9] only in row 2 (0-indexed), but expected has [2,9] in rows 1 and 4, and [9,9] in row 2; the code underplaced accents (9) and missed the centered double-9, likely due to incorrect motif periodicity or contiguous fill detection.
 * Train 2: Generated a 3-row horizontal grid with an extra all-8 top row and accents (3) shifted right in row 1, but expected starts with the patterned row and alternates without the extra row; output height is wrong (3 vs. 3 but misplaced), and motif repetition doesn't capture the diagonal/staggered 3s.
 * Train 3: Generated a 4-row horizontal grid missing the bottom row's pattern, with accents (4) in incorrect positions (e.g., row 0 has no accents, row 3 has trailing 4s instead of patterned); expected has 4 rows with repeating 3-wide blocks of 4s separated by 6s, but code's motif_len = main-1 causes truncation and uniform filling.
 * Train 4: Generated a 2-row horizontal grid with all-2s except one 8 in row 1 col 3, but expected 2 rows with alternating 2/8 in row 1 and a single patterned row 0; code failed to replicate the zigzag or full alternation, possibly due to cross-dimension slicing errors.
 * extract_panels and separator functions worked for basic division (assuming 4+ panels), but get_filled_pos hardcoded fill_value=4, which mismatches examples using 9, 3, etc., leading to empty filled lists and all-bg outputs.
 * build_motif's contiguity check and modulo placement is broken for non-linear patterns, often resulting in sparse or uniform accents instead of dense/repeating ones.
 * Output dimension calculation (out_cross = template_cross - 2, out_main = p2m + p3m - 2 + conditional p1m) is inconsistent and shrinks grids arbitrarily, causing height/width mismatches (e.g., Train 1 output 5x2 vs. expected 5x2 but wrong content; Train 2 extra row).
 * get_block_length is helpful for sizing but flips orientation incorrectly in some calls, leading to swapped main/cross.
 * Overall, the program assumes vertical/horizontal strictly and uniform color panels, missing subtle pattern mirroring or shifting across panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 vertical grid repeating two 5-row blocks: rows 0-4 and 5-9 each show a cross-like pattern of 7s on 8 background (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,7,8]; row 2: all 8s; row 3: [8,7,7,7,7]), but this repetition suggests the code extracted a motif from template and tiled it twice without variation, which doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting a single cohesive output grid.
 * It does not look correct because trainings failed similarly (repetitive but shifted/missing elements), and the double-tiling implies unhandled panel[1] or extra looping; likely the expected test output is a single 5x5 or adjusted-size grid with a non-repeating motif application, such as a single instance of the cross pattern without duplication.
 * The pattern itself (7s forming a plus or cross in columns 2-3) might accidentally resemble a motif, but the repetition and lack of border/subtraction (code uses -2) indicate overgeneration; no separators or colors match the hardcoded 4, so filled_pos probably returned empty, filling with acc=7/bg=8 uniformly except for template-derived positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid divided into panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first two panels serve as templates for patterns, and the subsequent panels provide color values (non-0/1 cells) to fill or modify a combined output grid. The output appears to replicate or interleave the template patterns using the extracted colors from later panels, often resulting in blocky or striped arrangements rather than simple alternations, with dimensions derived from combining panel sizes minus separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical orientation or vice versa), but the code assumes exactly 4 panels; real puzzles may have varying numbers, and outputs require at least 4, but examples show failures even with that.
 * Orientation is determined by grid shape (taller than wide = vertical, else horizontal), which seems reasonable but may not always hold if separators dictate it instead.
 * Color extraction ignores 0s and 1s, taking the unique non-separator value from a block/panel, assuming single color per block—this worked in assuming colors like 2/9, 8/3, etc., but fails if blocks have mixed colors or no unique color.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as combined block lengths minus 2 (for separators?), and cross dimension minus 2, but this leads to undersized or mismatched grids (e.g., example 1 expects 5x2 but generates similar size; example 2 expects 3x11 but generates 3x6).
 * Patterns in expected outputs are blocky repetitions or merges of template motifs (e.g., solid blocks of color in rows/columns, not pure checkerboards), suggesting templates define structural repeats (like stripes or clusters) to be filled with block colors.
 * Subtle: Outputs preserve aspect ratios or repeat small templates across larger spaces defined by blocks; example 3 shows diagonal-like blocks, not row alternations.
 * Panels may include empty or separator-adjacent areas; code strips them but may miscount starts/ends.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, return empty list—correct as a safeguard, but all examples failed despite assuming 4.
 * Vertical vs horizontal output filling differs (rows vs columns for checkerboard), but expectations show symmetric block patterns regardless of orientation.
 * Easy to miss: Templates (panels 0/1) may have their own internal patterns (not just colors) that need replication, not just color swaps; blocks (2/3) provide fill values but also sizes for output extent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    return w, h
```
(This correctly computes width and height, essential for orientation and sizing.)

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for i in range(h):
        if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i]):
            separators.append(i)
    return separators

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    h = len(g)
    separators = []
    for j in range(w):
        if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h)):
            separators.append(j)
    return separators
```
(These accurately detect full 1-lines as separators, crucial for panel division; useful across all examples.)

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = g[start:sep]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        panel = [row[start:sep] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if g and start < len(g[0]):
        panel = [row[start:] for row in g]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
(These slice the grid into panels correctly based on separators; handles both orientations and edge cases like trailing panels.)

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 1:
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
(Extracts a single dominant color from non-separator cells; worked for identifying 2/9, 8/3, etc., but assumes uniqueness—could be extended to handle multiples.)

```python
def get_block_length(panel: List[List[int]], orientation: str) -> int:
    if not panel:
        return 0
    if orientation == 'vertical':
        return len(panel)
    else:
        return len(panel[0]) if panel else 0
```
(Computes size along the relevant axis; partially useful for output sizing, but over-subtracts for separators in examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed exactly 4 panels (templates A/B, blocks A/B), which may fit but led to empty outputs if <4; all training examples processed as 4 but generated wrong patterns.
 * Orientation detection (h > w = vertical) seems correct but didn't adapt output filling properly.
 * Color extraction worked (e.g., got 2/9 for ex1, 8/3 for ex2) but ignored template patterns, treating everything as uniform fills.
 * Output generation created checkerboard alternations ((i+j)%2), which mismatched all expectations: ex1 expected blocky vertical stacks of 2s/9s (e.g., two 2s, then 2/9, then two 9s, etc.), but generated row-alternating stripes.
 * Ex2: Generated 3x6 alternating 8/3 rows, but expected 3x11 with clustered 8s (three-wide) interrupted by single 3s in a repeating motif; size wrong (6 vs 11 cols), pattern too uniform.
 * Ex3: Generated 4x10 alternating 6/4, but expected 4x15 with block pairs (two 6s/two 4s repeating, plus solid rows); ignored template replication.
 * Ex4: Generated 2x7 alternating 2/8, but expected 2x7 with first row as three 2s/single 8/repeat, second row full alternation—close in size but missed block clustering in row 0.
 * Dimension calc (out_large = large_a + large_b -2, out_cross = cross -2) undersized outputs (e.g., ex2: 6 cols vs 11 expected) and assumed separator subtraction, but expectations suggest additive panel merging without full subtraction.
 * get_block_length useful for sizes but combined wrongly; panel extraction worked but panels[0:2] as "templates" not used beyond ignoring their patterns.
 * Overall, separator/panel logic solid (likely correct division), but output as checkerboard irrelevant—puzzle needs pattern inheritance from templates, filled with block colors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid of strict row-alternating 8/7 (like extended checkerboard rows), which does not look correct based on training patterns.
 * It ignores blocky clustering seen in expectations (e.g., no multi-cell solids of 8s or 7s; just stripes), suggesting the same flawed checkerboard logic applied.
 * Size (10 rows, likely from vertical orientation with over-subtraction) may mismatch if test input expects wider/taller merged blocks; without input grid, can't confirm, but pattern uniformity differs from ex1-4's motifs (e.g., no repeated template shapes).
 * Colors 8/7 extracted correctly (assuming panels provided them), but application as alternation fails subtlety of replicating template structures (e.g., if templates have pairs or triples, output should cluster accordingly).
 * Does not make sense for puzzle: expectations show non-alternating blocks (e.g., ex3's two-wide 6s/4s), so this likely wrong—needs template pattern tiling with block colors, not (i+j)%2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into sequential panels by full separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for positions of a repeating motif, panels 2 and 3 provide accent colors for that motif, and the output is a tiled extension of the motif based on the template's structure, without extra padding or incorrect dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by identifying full lines of 1s as separators; these divide the grid into at least 4 panels (0-3), and the orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines whether separators are horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
 * The template (panel 0) defines "filled positions" where a special marker (e.g., 4) indicates where the accent color (from panels 2/3) should override a background color in the motif; the motif length is derived from the template's main dimension minus 1, and it's tiled along the output's main axis.
 * Output dimensions are computed by subtracting separator influence (e.g., cross dimension minus 2, main dimension via a formula involving panel mains), but this often overestimates size, leading to trailing 0-padded rows/columns; the output should match the tiled motif's natural size without padding.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values (e.g., 9 as accent from panel 2, 2 as background from panel 3?); if no such colors, output empty—but subtle: background might be from panel 3's dominant color, accent from panel 2.
 * Tiling repeats the motif fully along the output length, but only applies within the template's cross-slice (e.g., columns in vertical); ignore slices beyond template bounds.
 * Subtle: In vertical orientation, process columns of panel 0 (index j+1) to build vertical motifs tiled horizontally? No—code builds per cross-position a motif along main, but examples suggest horizontal tiling of a row-motif.
 * Easy to miss: Output should replicate the repeating pattern from panels 0-3 but extended/tiled infinitely in one direction, cropped to a minimal bounding box without 0s; training examples show compact outputs (e.g., 5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2), not padded grids.
 * Separators are skipped in panel extraction (start after sep+1), but output ignores them entirely.
 * If fewer than 4 panels, output empty grid.
 * Cross dimension for output is total minus 2 (for separators?), but this fails when separators are not at edges or multiple.
 * Motif building: Positions are 0-indexed offsets (p-1), filled with accent (color1 from panel2), else background (color2 from panel3); but in ex1, pattern like [2,2,9] suggests background 2, accent 9, with positions indicating where 9 overrides.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect output dimensions: generated oversized grids (e.g., 5x16 for ex1 with trailing 0s per row; 20x11? for ex2 with many empty rows; 24x15? for ex3 with excessive 0-rows; 21x7? for ex4 with empty rows) instead of compact expected sizes (5x2 for ex1, 3x11 for ex2, 4x15 for ex3, 3x7 for ex4).
 * What worked: Panel extraction correctly identifies separators and splits into panels (e.g., for ex1, likely got 5 panels but used first 4); orientation detection seems accurate (vertical for tall grids like ex1/ex3); color extraction grabs non-1 values (e.g., 9 and 2 for ex1).
 * What didn't work: Output size computation (compute_out_main and out_cross) overestimates main/cross dims (e.g., subtracts 2 but ignores multiple separators or edge cases, leading to large out_main/out_cross); results in grids much larger than needed, filled with 0s beyond the tiled motif.
 * Motif building and tiling partially works but applies incorrectly: For ex1 (vertical?), it tiled a [2,2,9] motif but padded rows to 16 cols instead of 2; for ex2 (horizontal, 3 rows x11 cols), generated 20 rows with pattern in first 3 but extra empty; similar repetition errors in ex3/ex4 where pattern repeats (e.g., 4 rows in ex3) but adds way too many 0-rows.
 * get_panel_main is helpful for lengths but used wrongly in size calc (e.g., for vertical, len(panel) is height, but formula max(0, p2m + p3m -2) doesn't match compact output).
 * build_motif and tile_motif are conceptually good for repeating patterns with overrides, but filled_pos assumes marker=4 which isn't in examples (e.g., ex1 pattern [2,2]/[2,9]/[9,9] suggests implicit positions from panel0 structure, not 4); leads to wrong motif (e.g., ex1 generated partial [2,2,9,...0s] instead of clean repeat).
 * get_orientation uses h>w for vertical, but ex2/ex4 seem horizontal (wider) and code handles but pads vertically wrong.
 * In ex1, generated repeats the 3-row pattern twice + 2 more partial rows with 0s, but expected is 5 rows x2 cols without padding—mismatch in cross-dim handling (used full w=16? instead of panel0 w=2).
 * In ex2, generated 3-row pattern + 18 empty rows (total 21?), but expected just 3x11—vertical padding error in horizontal case.
 * In ex3, generated 4-row pattern repeated ~6 times? + empty, but expected just 4x15—over-tiling in main dim.
 * In ex4, generated 3-row pattern +18 empty, expected 3x7—same padding issue.
 * Function compute_out_main is broken (formulas like p2m + p3m -2 don't yield correct small sizes; e.g., for ex1, likely computed large out_main); don't use as-is.
 * get_filled_pos is unhelpful/broken (hardcodes ==4, but examples have no 4s—positions from panel0's non-0/1? or structure; replace with pattern detection).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a 10x24 grid repeating a 4-row x6-col pattern ([8,8,7,...] etc.) twice (rows 0-3 and 4-7) with slight variation in row8-9, then all 0s from col6 onward in early rows and full 0-rows later—but this includes massive 0-padding (e.g., 24 cols instead of ~6, 10 rows instead of 4 or tiled minimal), which mismatches the compact training expectations.
 * It seems to detect vertical orientation (10 rows shown, but input likely taller?), extract colors 7 (accent?) and 8 (background?), and tile a motif per column, but overestimates out_w=24 (perhaps total w) and out_h=10 with incomplete tiling, leading to partial patterns and 0s; expected likely a clean 4x6 or extended tiled without 0s (e.g., infinite repeat cropped to pattern repeat unit, like ex3's 4x15 but without extras).
 * Does not make sense as final output—too padded and oversized, similar to training failures; probably wrong motif positions (no 4s, so empty filled_pos? but generated some 7s, maybe fallback); needs dimension fix to match panel0's cross-dim and tile only along main without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, where the first panel serves as a template pattern (with 4s indicating filled positions and 1s as borders), the second-to-last panel provides a background color, and the last panel provides an accent color; the goal is to generate a larger output grid that tiles or extends the template's motif using the accent color on a background, adjusting dimensions based on panel sizes and orientation (vertical or horizontal layout).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by rows or columns entirely filled with 1s; the code assumes horizontal separators if height > width, vertical otherwise, but this may not always hold if the grid is square or if separators are mixed.
 * Template panel uses 4 as a fill marker for the motif pattern, with 1s as borders; the motif is extracted as contiguous filled positions per "slice" (column if vertical, row if horizontal), and it's repeated with a motif_len = template_main - 1, but this repetition logic fails when the pattern isn't strictly periodic or when slices have non-contiguous fills.
 * Background (bg) and accent (acc) colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in their panels; if missing (returns 0), output is empty, which is a safeguard but may skip valid cases.
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2 (removing borders), main dimension varies— for vertical: bg_main + acc_main - 2; for horizontal non-contiguous: same, but for horizontal contiguous: bg_main + acc_main + template_main - 2—which introduces inconsistencies and likely causes dimension mismatches.
 * Motif application: accent is placed in output where i % motif_len matches filled positions in template slices; this assumes a simple modular repetition, but puzzles may require mirroring, scaling, or combining bg/acc patterns differently (e.g., bg and acc influencing motif density or position).
 * Contiguity check: Ensures filled positions in each slice are consecutive without gaps; if not, adjusts out_main, but this is only applied in horizontal case, leading to asymmetric handling.
 * Edge cases: Empty panels, zero dimensions, or no 4s in template lead to empty output; color extraction ignores 0/1 but assumes exactly one other color per panel.
 * Orientation matters: Vertical layout treats rows as main dimension, columns as cross; swapping may be needed if initial assumption fails.
 * Subtle: Outputs must match exact expected grids, including size and values; even small shifts in motif placement or dimension calculation cause full mismatches.
 * All training examples show pattern inversion or misalignment (e.g., expected symmetric frames become offset repeats), suggesting the tiling/repetition doesn't capture the puzzle's "framing" or "mirroring" rule.

These functions are solid for panel extraction and color detection but need refinement in motif tiling logic. The contiguity check in the original is helpful for detecting gaps but is inconsistently applied.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The motif application loop in the original (using i % motif_len in filled_set) is broken—it produces offset or incomplete repeats, as seen in all examples; avoid direct reuse without fixing the periodicity or mirroring. The dimension calculation for out_main is inconsistent and often undersizes/oversizes the output, leading to shape mismatches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, panel extraction via separators works partially, correctly identifying template, bg_panel, and acc_panel in structure, but fails to generate the correct tiled pattern.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 5x2 grid with alternating 2/9 rows in a zigzag, but expected a framed pattern with 2 borders around 9 centers in columns; difference: motif repetition created vertical stripes instead of horizontal framing, and dimensions matched but content was inverted (e.g., [9,9] where [2,9] expected).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 3x11 grid with repeating 8/3 stripes that don't align symmetrically, but expected a cross-like pattern with 8 frames and 3 accents in a mirrored way; difference: output has irregular 3-clumps in rows 1-3, while expected has uniform 8-rows with 3 insertions in row 2; unknown why the vertical tiling didn't capture the horizontal symmetry.
 * Training example 3: Generated a 4x15 grid with scattered 6/4 blocks, but expected a more structured frame with 6 borders and 4 fills in a repeating unit; difference: output rows have mismatched lengths in patterns (e.g., row 0 has 6,4,4,6... but expected row 0 is 6,6,4,4,...), suggesting failed contiguity or wrong motif_len; the +template_main adjustment wasn't triggered correctly.
 * Training example 4: Generated a 2x7 grid with 2/8 in a simple repeat, but expected a full 2-border frame around 8 in row 0; difference: row 0 is [2,8,8,8,2,8,8] (partial frame with extra 8s), row 1 matches exactly—close but overflows the framing rule.
 * extract_panels is essential and mostly correct for splitting, but assumes fixed panel roles (first=template, -2=bg, -1=acc) which holds here but may not if panels vary.
 * Color extraction works in all cases (e.g., 9,3,4,8 correctly pulled).
 * Dimension logic partially works (e.g., out_cross = template_cross - 2 avoids borders), but out_main calculation fails consistently, often ignoring bg/acc contributions properly.
 * Contiguity check is useful but only applied selectively, missing gaps in vertical cases and causing non-contiguous accents to misplace.
 * All attempts miss the puzzle's likely "framing" or "border extension" rule, where bg/acc panels suggest how to extend the template into a larger symmetric structure rather than modular tiling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid repeating a 5x4 motif block (two copies of a plus-like pattern with 8 bg and 7 acc) vertically, but it does not look correct—it's overly repetitive and lacks variation, suggesting the program defaulted to horizontal layout and simple % repetition without adapting to the test input's specific template.
 * Expected output likely involves a single extended frame or tiled unit using 8 as bg and 7 as acc in a cross/plus shape extended by bg/acc panel sizes, but generated has stacked duplicates (e.g., lines 0-4 repeat in 5-9) with no dimension adjustment, making it too tall and uniform; this mismatches the training expectations of asymmetric or mirrored extensions.
 * The output ignores potential vertical orientation or contiguity, producing a "wallpaper" effect instead of a puzzle-specific composition; to handle test, need to verify if test input has horizontal/vertical separators and adjust motif to non-modular placement (e.g., direct concatenation or mirroring).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by horizontal or vertical separator lines (rows or columns entirely filled with 1s), with the first panel serving as a template pattern, the second-to-last panel defining a background color, and the last panel defining an accent color. The goal is to generate an output grid that tiles a motif extracted from the template (using background for certain template values like 4 and accent for others) across a combined main dimension derived from the background and accent panels, minus separators, while preserving the cross dimension minus borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are extracted by splitting on full lines of 1s; assume vertical orientation if height > width, using horizontal separators, else horizontal orientation with vertical separators—handle empty or single-panel cases by returning empty output.
 * Template motif is built from the inner area of the template (skipping border rows/columns, indexed from 1), mapping template value 4 to background color and other non-0/1 values to accent color; the motif size is (template_main - 1) by (template_cross - 2).
 * Output dimensions: cross dimension is template_cross - 2; main dimension is background_main + accent_main - 2 (accounting for shared separators or borders).
 * Tiling repeats the motif along the main dimension by cycling through its rows/columns to fill the full output_main length; orientation matters—vertical means rows are main, columns are cross; horizontal means columns are main, rows are cross.
 * Colors are extracted as the unique non-0/1 value in a panel; if no such value or 0, output is empty.
 * Subtlety: The -2 in main dimension likely subtracts for the two separator lines (one from each panel), but this underestimates in some cases, leading to shorter outputs; ensure tiling covers the exact combined inner sizes without overlap loss.
 * Handle cases where panels have varying inner content (e.g., full-color panels for bg/acc); assume all panels are rectangular and aligned.
 * Easy to miss: Template borders are skipped (outer rows/cols are ignored in motif), and output has no borders (pure tiled motif); if fewer than 4 panels, output empty.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with numbers representing colors; generated outputs must match expected exactly in size and values.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies panels, extracts template/bg/acc, and builds a basic motif for training examples 1 and 4, passing them exactly.
 * For training 2 (horizontal orientation): Generated a 3x6 output, but expected 3x11; the output shows partial tiling of a 3x5 motif (repeating once fully but missing extensions), differing in width (6 vs 11 columns) and missing additional motif cycles in the second and third rows (e.g., expected has extra [8,3,8,8,8] patterns); likely due to underestimating out_main_num = bg_main + acc_main - 2, which didn't account for full combined inner length.
 * For training 3 (vertical orientation): Generated a 4x10 output, but expected 4x15; output tiles a motif partially (repeating ~2 times but truncated), differing in height per row? Wait, no—it's 4 rows x 10 cols vs 4x15, with missing extensions in each row (e.g., first row ends [6,6] but expected continues [4,4,6,6,4]); again, out_main_num too small, causing incomplete cycling along columns.
 * Training 1 and 4 succeeded, suggesting correct motif extraction and basic tiling logic, but scaling fails when bg/acc mains are larger, possibly miscounting inner dimensions (e.g., not subtracting borders correctly for bg/acc).
 * Function get_panel_main is helpful but may be broken: it returns full len(panel) for vertical (rows) but len(panel[0]) for horizontal (cols), without subtracting borders, leading to over-subtraction in out_main_num.
 * Functions like get_template_main_cross correctly skip template borders but assume fixed -1/-2; this works for small cases but not when bg/acc have internal structure.
 * No object extraction needed (grids are abstract colors, not shapes); prior unhelpful ideas like blob detection would be irrelevant here.
 * Subtle issue: In motif building, template indexing starts at +1 for main and +1 for cross, assuming 1-thick borders; if borders vary, this breaks—easy to miss if inputs always have uniform borders.
 * Tiling uses % l for cycling, which is correct but only fills to out_main_num, so root cause is dimension miscalculation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 10x5 grid that repeats a 4-row pattern (two full [8,8,7,8,8]/[8,7,7,7,8]/[8,8,8,8,8]/[7,7,7,7,7] blocks plus a partial third: two more rows), suggesting vertical orientation with cross=5 (template_cross-2? but includes borders?) and main=10, but it looks incorrect because the pattern doesn't align with a clean motif tiling—e.g., the third block starts repeating the first two rows without completing the 4-row motif or matching expected seamless extension; likely same dimension error as training 2/3, under-tiling the full bg+acc main (expected probably longer, like 12-15 rows with full cycles using 7 as acc and 8 as bg). It doesn't make sense as a final puzzle output, as it appears truncated mid-motif, missing the full combined length and possibly inverting bg/acc mapping (e.g., if template has 4s as bg but here 7/8 placement seems off).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids are divided into panels by full lines of 1s acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract a motif, the second-to-last panel providing the background color, and the last panel providing the accent color. The output is a generated pattern that weaves or repeats the motif from the template (replacing 0s with accent and others with background) into a larger grid, with orientation (vertical or horizontal) determined by whether height exceeds width, leading to row- or column-based panel splitting and motif application.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are split excluding the separator lines themselves (start after previous sep, end before next), but must result in at least 4 panels (template + at least two more for bg/acc) or output empty list.
 * Orientation check (h > w for vertical) dictates separator type: horizontal seps for vertical orientation (splitting rows), vertical seps for horizontal (splitting columns); this affects how the motif is extracted and woven.
 * Template motif extraction excludes border rows/columns (inner start=1 to end-1), replacing 0s with accent color and non-0/1 with background; motif length is inner height/width minus borders, but output dimensions involve (inner_cross * motif_len - 1) for main axis and (inner_cross) for cross axis.
 * Weaving logic shortens the last motif placement (uses motif_len -1 elements in final position) to create an interlocking or overlapping pattern across the cross dimension, avoiding full repetition.
 * Color extraction takes the first non-0/1 value in a panel as the color (assuming uniform); if bg or acc is 0, output empty—subtlety: panels might have mixed cells, but code assumes single color.
 * Empty or invalid templates (e.g., inner cross <=0 or insufficient size) return empty; separators must be full lines of 1s across the relevant axis.
 * Subtle element: Output is always rectangular, but main dimension is reduced by 1 to account for weaving overlap, which could mismatch if motif placement logic errs on boundaries.
 * Across attempts, ensure panel count >=4; training 1 failure suggests mis-split or wrong orientation/motif len for that case, possibly due to separator detection or vertical/horiz swap.
 * Consider grids with uneven panel sizes or partial 1s (but code requires full lines, so invalid seps ignored).

Panel extraction utilities; row-based for vertical orient, col-based for horiz—correctly skips seps and copies subgrids.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = set(cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1})
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Simple color pull from non-separator/non-empty cells; assumes single color per panel, helpful but could fail on multi-color (returns first).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 2, 3, and 4 all correct, indicating successful panel splitting, motif extraction, color assignment, and weaving for those cases—likely well-oriented grids with clear seps and valid templates.
 * Training example 1 incorrect: generated 3 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [2,2]) vs. expected 5 rows ([2,2], [2,9], [9,9], [2,2], [2,9])—suggests miscalculation of out_main height (possibly wrong motif_len or out_cross, or incomplete weaving with shortened last motif cutting too much; unknown if orientation was wrong, but effect is truncated output missing two rows with [9,9] pattern).
 * Overall, separator detection and panel extraction worked (got 4+ panels), color get_color succeeded (used 2 as bg?, 9 as acc), but vertical weaving logic failed to produce full expected length/ pattern for train 1—possibly border exclusion or pos increment in motif placement off by 1.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (dimensions, seps, panels, color) are relevant and functional, though weaving in program() body has bugs in dimension calc or loop for certain template sizes.
 * Empty returns on <4 panels or invalid dims worked as safeguard, preventing bad outputs in edge cases.

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 15-row by 5-column grid with repeating 3-row motif: row A [8,8,7,8,8], row B [8,7,7,7,8], row C [8,8,8,8,8], repeated ~5 times but ends abruptly after 14-15 rows without full cycles (listed as A,B,C x4 + A,B).
 * Pattern uses 8 (likely bg) dominant, 7 (likely acc) in "inner" positions of A/B, full 8s in C—suggests horizontal orientation (wide motif), successful color/motif extract, but repetition seems over-long or miscounted (out_main = out_cross * motif_len -1 might yield ~15 if template inner ~3x something, but weaving shortens last, possibly causing incomplete final cycle).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition is uniform but truncated/mismatched length (15 rows uneven for 3-row motif x5=15, but ends on B not C), and if test input expects tighter interlocking (like train1's [9,9] inserts), the full-8 rows might be overused; differs from train1 error by being too long vs. too short, hinting consistent but flawed dimension/weaving formula—account for exact pos increments to avoid partial motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by full separator lines (of 1s) into multiple panels, where patterns from one panel (filled positions marked as 4) are used to derive and tile motifs based on colors from other panels, producing an output grid of specific dimensions oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the input shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid orientation is determined by comparing width (w) and height (h): vertical if h > w (motifs along height), horizontal otherwise (motifs along width); this affects how panels are split and how output is filled.
 * Separators are full rows (horizontal case) or columns (vertical case) entirely filled with 1s; they divide the grid into panels, but the code assumes at least 4 panels exist, returning empty if fewer— this could miss cases with fewer or irregular divisions.
 * Panel 0 provides "filled positions" (cells == 4) along slices (columns or rows offset by 1), which influence motif building; if positions form a contiguous block, it creates a solid color block shifted by position, otherwise defaults to alternating colors.
 * Colors are extracted from panels 2 and 3 (non-0/1 values); if both are 0, output is empty. Motifs are built with length = panel0_main - 1 (or 1 if 0), then tiled to output main dimension, which is computed differently for orientations (subtract 2 for vertical, conditional for horizontal based on block sizes and separators).
 * Output cross dimension is input cross - 2 (for borders?); must be >=1, else empty. Subtle: filled_pos only checks for value==4 in panel0 slices, ignoring other values; motif defaults to alternating if not contiguous block.
 * Easy to miss: num_sep (separator count) only affects horizontal out_main computation if block1_main <= cross; tiling repeats full motifs then partial remainder; output grid is initialized to 0s and filled per slice.
 * Panels are extracted excluding separators (start to sep, then sep+1 onward), so separators act as dividers but aren't included in panels.
 * If panel empty or dimensions 0, early returns prevent errors but could skip valid edge cases.

            if panel[slice_idx][j] == fill_value:
                filled_pos.append(j)
    return filled_pos
```

(Note: Functions like get_orientation_and_cross, build_motif, tile_motif_to_main, and compute_out_main from the attempt are helpful for motif logic and dimension calc, but build_motif has a bug in contiguous block handling— it sets motif to all color2 then overrides only block1 positions, potentially missing gaps; tile_motif_to_main assumes motif non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting separators, splitting panels, extracting colors (non-0/1), finding filled_pos (==4 in panel0 slices), building/tile motifs, and filling output grid with proper orientation/dimensions.
 * Worked well for cases where panels >=4, contiguous filled blocks in panel0 led to shifted solid motifs, and alternating defaults applied correctly; dimension computations (out_main, out_cross) matched expected for training.
 * Did not handle cases with <4 panels (returns empty, potentially wrong if puzzle allows fewer); motif length = panel0_main -1 assumes a border, which worked for training but may not generalize.
 * In build_motif, contiguous check (num == maxp - minp +1) correctly identifies blocks but only shifts a single block of color1 on color2 background—may miss multi-block or gapped patterns in panel0.
 * get_block_length assumes non-empty panels and uses len(panel) or len(panel[0]), but doesn't handle empty panels gracefully beyond 0 return.
 * No issues with separator detection in training, but vertical/horizontal panel extraction skips empty segments (good), yet assumes input_slice = k+1 doesn't overflow (potential subtle bug if cross small).
 * Overall, core logic (separators -> panels -> colors -> motifs -> tile -> fill) is solid for training but untested on variations like non-contiguous fills or odd dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, each with 5 values) using only 7s and 8s, forming a repeating 4-row pattern: row types alternate between [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,7,7,7], then repeat (last row partial but fits pattern).
 * This looks like tiled horizontal motifs (orientation likely horizontal, out_height= out_cross=5-2?=3 but actually 10 rows suggest vertical or miscalc? Wait, 10 rows x 5 cols implies out_main=10, out_cross=5, possibly vertical orientation with tiling along height).
 * It makes partial sense as a motif-based output (alternating/solid rows of 7/8, suggesting color1=7, color2=8 or vice versa, with some filled_pos creating solids), but does not look fully correct—repetition every 4 rows implies short motif length (e.g., 4 or 2) tiled ~2.5 times, yet lacks variety expected if panel0 had diverse filled_pos (==4); all rows uniform across columns suggests no per-slice variation in filled_pos, possibly over-relying on default alternating or full-block motif.
 * Different from expected: If test input has varied 4s in panel0 slices, output should have column-wise differences (vertical fill) or row-wise (horizontal), but here it's row-patterned without slice variation—likely a bug in get_filled_pos (always same filled_pos?) or input_slice=k+1 not varying enough; also, why 7/8 specifically? Matches get_color if panels 2/3 use those, but repetition seems too rigid, missing subtle shifts from minp in build_motif.
 * Unknown why no 0s or other values (grid init to 0 but fully filled), and output height=10 suggests out_main calc (block1+block2-2 or +num_sep) hit a specific test config, but without test input grid, hard to verify—appears over-simplified, potentially ignoring gaps in filled_pos.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid divided into panels by separator lines of 1s, using the first panel as a template to extract a motif (where 4 indicates background color placement, and other values indicate accent), deriving background and accent colors from the second-to-last and last panels, and generating a repeating striped or tiled output pattern based on the grid's orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal). The output extends the motif horizontally or vertically to a length derived from the background and accent panel dimensions, potentially adjusted for contiguity in motifs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid orientation determines separator search: horizontal separators (full rows of 1s) for vertical layouts (h > w), vertical separators (full columns of 1s) for horizontal layouts (h <= w).
 * Panels are extracted between separators; requires at least 4 panels (template, at least one middle, bg, acc); bg_panel is second-to-last, acc_panel is last.
 * Template uses inner area (border of 1 cell stripped), where cells ==4 map to bg_color, other non-0/1 map to acc_color; motif per cross-dimension slice appends one acc_color.
 * Colors extracted from bg_panel and acc_panel as the unique non-0/1 value; fail if 0.
 * Output dimensions: main dimension extended to out_main = bg_main + acc_main - 2 (or + template_main if motifs are contiguous in horizontal case); cross dimension is template_cross - 2.
 * Contiguity check (horizontal only): for each cross-slice, positions where template==4 must form a single contiguous block (no gaps); if all slices contiguous, extend out_main by template's main_dim (subtle hack to handle repeating full template periods?).
 * Inner dimensions must be >=2 after border strip; output is empty list if invalid (e.g., <4 panels, invalid colors/dims).
 * Motif repetition uses modulo period (motif length) to tile along main dimension.
 * Subtle: separators include the lines themselves (panels exclude them); empty panels possible but lead to failures.
 * Borders in template are assumed 1-cell thick; no handling for irregular borders or non-1 separators.
 * Vertical output: list of lists with height=out_main, width=inner_cross; horizontal: height=inner_cross, width=out_main.
 * Potential misses: non-square panels, varying panel heights/widths across, motif with all 4s or no 4s, colors >1 but not unique per panel.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; successfully passed all 4 training examples (generated correct outputs matching expected patterns).
 * Panel extraction and separator detection worked reliably for training cases, correctly identifying template, bg, and acc panels.
 * Motif extraction and color mapping (4->bg, other->acc, append acc) functioned as intended for vertical and horizontal orientations in training.
 * Contiguity check and out_main extension (in horizontal case) did not trigger issues in training but may be a fragile adjustment for specific motif continuity.
 * No prior unhelpful functions; all provided (e.g., get_dimensions, find_separators) are essential for parsing and are not broken, though contiguity logic is subtle/ad-hoc and could miss non-contiguous motifs that should still tile.
 * Training successes suggest core logic (repeating motif tiling) aligns with puzzle, but no details on why training grids/orientations succeeded (e.g., all vertical? all contiguous?).

**Test output:**
 * Generated a 10-row by 5-column grid using colors 7 (likely bg) and 8 (likely acc), showing a repeating pattern: rows 1/5/9: [8,8,7,8,8]; rows 2/6/10: [8,7,7,7,8]; rows 3/7: [8,8,8,8,8]; rows 4/8: [7,7,7,7,7]; partial repeat to row 10.
 * Output dimensions (h=10 > w=5) suggest horizontal input layout (is_vertical=False), with inner_cross=5 (full width, no strip?), out_main=10; pattern implies motif length=4 per column (e.g., col0: 8,8,8,7 repeating; col1: 8,7,8,7; etc.), with possible contiguity-triggered extension (out_main += main_dim, making longer repeat).
 * Does not look fully correct: repetition seems consistent with code's modulo tiling but truncated at 10 rows (expected full periods?); inner_cross=5 suggests no border strip or cross_dim=7, but pattern has non-uniform motifs (e.g., col2 mostly 7/8 but shifted), which may mismatch if template inner expects stripped borders—possible over-extension from contiguity or incorrect panel dims.
 * Difference from expected: without test input grid, hard to verify motif source, but output lacks clear full-period closure (ends mid-repeat at row10), and uniform row4/8 (all 7s) vs. varied others suggests acc/border bleed; if expected is shorter/tighter tiling (e.g., 8 rows), the +main_dim extension may have over-lengthened; it's different in lacking symmetry or exact period match to a simple motif append.
 * Makes partial sense (plausible color tiling) but likely incorrect due to dimension/extension bugs—e.g., why 10 rows specifically? (bg_main + acc_main -2 + main_dim=10?); need to validate against test input's panel sizes/motifs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid is divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), and the first panel serves as a template to generate a larger output grid by tiling a motif derived from the template's inner content, using colors extracted from background and accent panels (the second-to-last and last panels). The output orients vertically or horizontally based on the input's aspect ratio, with the motif placing background color where the template has 4s and accent color elsewhere, plus an extra accent column/row for periodicity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators are strictly full lines of 1s (horizontal for vertical layouts, vertical for horizontal); partial 1s or other values do not count, and empty grids return empty outputs.
 * Orientation is determined by height > width (vertical: row-based panels) vs. otherwise (horizontal: column-based panels), which affects how panels are extracted and how the output is tiled (row-wise vs. column-wise).
 * Panels must be at least 4 for processing; fewer result in empty output—template is first panel, bg is second-last, acc is last; colors are the unique non-0/1 value in bg/acc panels (0 if none).
 * Template processing excludes a 1-cell border (inner_main = main_dim - 2, inner_cross = cross_dim - 2); if either <=0, output is empty.
 * Motif construction: For each inner cross position, fill inner_main positions with bg_color if template inner value ==4, else acc_color; append an extra acc_color position for period = inner_main +1.
 * Output main dimension calculation has a subtlety for horizontal layouts: If all filled slices (where template inner ==4) are contiguous per cross position, out_main = template_main + bg_main + acc_main -2; else out_main = bg_main + acc_main -2 (vertical always uses bg_main + acc_main -2).
 * Tiling wraps the motif periodically along the main dimension (pos = i % period), filling the cross dimension directly from motif.
 * Borders in template/panels are assumed to be 1s or ignored for inner extraction; get_inner_value skips the border by indexing at 1+ offsets.
 * Colors must be non-zero/non-1; if bg or acc color is 0, output empty—ensures valid motif.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal contiguous check only applies if there are filled positions; empty filled slices are okay but don't affect contiguity. Also, panel extraction skips separators (start = sep +1), so panels don't include 1-lines.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the presented attempt (no prior ones shown); it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid grasp of panel splitting, color extraction, motif periodicity, and tiling for both orientations.
 * Worked well: Separator detection accurately splits into panels; color extraction ignores 0/1 borders; inner template processing with 4->bg mapping produces expected motif; contiguity check for horizontal out_main adjustment passed trainings without issues.
 * Did not work/missed: No failures in training, but the horizontal contiguity logic (filled slices must be contiguous per cross position) is only used if slices are non-empty—could miss cases where template has no 4s at all (falls back to bg+acc-2, which worked for trainings).
 * get_dimensions, find_separators, get_panel_rows/columns, and get_color are essential and correct; they robustly handle empty/edge cases.
 * The program's get_panel_main (len(pan) or len(pan[0])) is helpful for dimension extraction but assumes non-empty panels—could fail silently if panels are empty (returns 0, leading to empty output, which is safe).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the contiguity check's get_filled_for_slice is specific to horizontal and could be generalized but isn't broken.
 * Trainings all correct, so no mismatches in blob shapes, omissions, or divider issues; unknown if trainings had contiguous vs. non-contiguous cases, but it handled them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, 5 columns each) with a clear repeating pattern: three row types cycle ( [8,8,7,8,8], [8,7,7,7,8], [8,8,8,8,8] ) followed by [7,7,7,7,7], repeating the first three twice more, suggesting horizontal orientation with period=4 (inner_main=3 +1), out_cross=5, and out_main=10 (possibly from contiguity allowing template_main + bg + acc -2).
 * It makes sense as a tiled motif: Columns 1-5 show varying 7/8 placements, with full 8-row and full 7-row insertions, aligning with accent/bg colors (assuming 7=acc, 8=bg) and periodic filling where template inners dictate positions.
 * Looks correct based on rules—no empty output despite complex dims, pattern repeats consistently without gaps/overlaps, and includes full accent rows (all 7s) as expected from bg/acc panels; no obvious differences from expected (e.g., no missing borders or wrong periodicity), but without test input grid, can't confirm exact panel splits or colors—assume matches since trainings passed.
 * Subtle: The output has 3 full cycles minus one, with inserted all-7 and all-8 rows; if test input had non-contiguous 4s, it correctly used shorter out_main, but pattern suggests contiguity was true.

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid divided into panels by separator lines (full rows or columns of 1s), where the first panel serves as a template for a repeating motif, the second-to-last panel provides a background color, and the last panel provides an accent color; the program extracts these, builds a motif by mapping template values (replacing 4s with background or accent), checks for contiguity in the template, and tiles the motif into a new output grid oriented vertically or horizontally based on the input's aspect ratio.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Panels are separated by full lines of 1s; horizontal separators for vertical inputs (taller than wide) and vertical for horizontal inputs (wider than tall).
 * Template motif is extracted from slices (columns or rows) excluding borders, replacing 4s with background color and others with accent; motifs are repeated to fill the output.
 * Output dimensions derive from template's main/cross sizes, adjusted by background and accent panel sizes (subtracting 2 for borders), with an additional contiguity check for horizontal inputs to extend the main dimension.
 * Colors are non-0/1 values from panels; if panels lack valid colors or insufficient panels (<4), output empty grid.
 * Subtle: Contiguity check ensures filled positions (4s) in template slices form unbroken segments without gaps; only applied in non-vertical case.
 * Motif length is main-1 (excluding border), and tiling uses modulo for repetition; output is initialized to 0s and filled column/row-wise.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; invalid dimensions or separators lead to empty output; assumes consistent panel widths/heights.
 * Vertical vs. horizontal detection uses h > w; output orientation flips accordingly (e.g., vertical input produces row-wise motif filling).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)  # Core function to split grid into panels based on orientation.
```

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    colors = {cell for row in block for cell in row if cell not in {0, 1}}
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0  # Extracts the primary non-background/separator color from a panel.
```

    return True  # Checks if 4s in template slices form contiguous blocks (no gaps); key for horizontal extension.
```

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) successfully passed all 4 training examples, indicating correct handling of panel extraction, color mapping, contiguity checks, and motif tiling for standard cases.
 * Worked well for vertical and horizontal orientations, separator detection, and basic motif repetition.
 * The contiguity check and main dimension extension for horizontal inputs appear functional based on training success.
 * No prior misses noted, but potential subtlety: assumes exactly 4+ panels with template first and last two as color sources; may fail if panel count or structure varies.
 * Functions like extract_panels, get_color, and build_motif are essential and correct for core logic.
 * are_all_contiguous is helpful but only used in non-vertical case; could be unhelpful or overly restrictive if puzzle allows gaps in some cases (unknown without expected test output).
 * get_dimensions and separator finders are solid and reusable; no breakage observed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, 5 columns) with a repeating pattern of 7s and 8s: it tiles three blocks of 3 rows each (with a 1-row separator-like pattern of all 8s or 7s), specifically alternating motifs like borders of 8s with inner 7s, and a full row of 7s as dividers.
 * This looks plausible and correct as a motif-tiled output: it matches the code's logic of repeating slices (e.g., motifs derived from template slices filled with bg=7, acc=8 or similar), with repetition every 4 rows (3 motif + 1 divider), and consistent column patterns suggesting horizontal input orientation with cross=5 (out_cross=3 slices) and extended main dimension.
 * No obvious errors; the pattern is symmetric and contiguous, aligning with contiguity check; if the test input has a template with 4s in positions mapping to 7/8, this would match expected tiling without gaps.
 * Subtle match: The output's repeating blocks (e.g., rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-9 partial) suggest motif_len=3 (main-1=4? but adjusted), and full 7-row or 8-row lines as derived from bg/acc panels; it makes sense for the puzzle rules without known deviations.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:40:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into panels by full lines of 1's acting as separators, with the first panel serving as a template to extract and tile motifs (patterns of positions marked by 4's or other values), using background and accent colors derived from the second-to-last and last panels, respectively, to generate a new output grid of adjusted dimensions. The orientation (vertical if height > width, else horizontal) determines how panels are extracted and motifs are built and tiled, with the output tiling the motifs repeatedly along the main dimension while using a reduced cross dimension from the template.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Separators must be complete rows (for vertical orientation) or columns (for horizontal) entirely filled with 1's; partial or incomplete separators should not be detected.
 * Orientation is determined strictly by comparing grid height (rows) to width (columns): vertical if h > w, which affects panel extraction (row-slicing vs. column-slicing) and motif building (vertical slices vs. horizontal).
 * Panels are extracted excluding the separator lines themselves; the first panel is the template (with special value 4 indicating background positions in motifs), the second-to-last provides the background color (first non-0/1 value found), and the last provides the accent color.
 * Motif extraction: For each slice (starting from index 1, skipping borders), collect positions where template !=4 for accent, ==4 for background; motifs are built as lists of colors for tiling.
 * Output dimensions: Cross dimension is always template_cross - 2 (skipping borders); main dimension is bg_main + acc_main - 2, but in horizontal orientation, add template_main if all "filled" slices (with 4's) are contiguous (no gaps in the positions with 4's across the slice).
 * Tiling: Repeat the motif cyclically along the main dimension for each cross slice; if a slice has no valid motif (e.g., wrong length), skip it.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids or panels return empty output; invalid colors (0) cause early return; ensure motif length == template_main -1; contiguity check only applies to horizontal and verifies that filled positions (4's) in each slice form a solid block without holes.
 * Subtle elements: The value 4 in the template specifically denotes background replacement, while other values (presumably non-0/1) denote accent; panels may have varying sizes, but mains are lengths along the main axis; horizontal contiguity addition to out_main can significantly change output size if triggered, which might be easy to miscalculate.
 * All considerations: Handle both orientations symmetrically but with the contiguity adjustment only in horizontal; ensure output is initialized to 0's and only filled where motifs apply; no rotation or flipping of panels; colors are single values per panel, taking the first/only non-0/1 found.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g[0]), len(g)
```
Basic grid sizing, essential for orientation and validation.

```python
def find_horizontal_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    h = len(g)
    return [i for i in range(h) if all(cell == 1 for cell in g[i])]

def find_vertical_separators(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    h = len(g)
    return [j for j in range(w) if all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(h])]
```
Core for detecting separators; horizontal for row-wise (vertical orient), vertical for column-wise (horizontal orient); reliable as shown by training success.

```python
def get_panel_rows(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if start < sep:
            panels.append(g[start:sep])
        start = sep + 1
    if start < len(g):
        panels.append(g[start:])
    return panels

def get_panel_columns(g: List[List[int]], separators: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    panels = []
    start = 0
    for sep in separators:
        if start < sep:
            panel = [[g[i][j] for j in range(start, sep)] for i in range(h)]
            panels.append(panel)
        start = sep + 1
    if start < w:
        panel = [[g[i][j] for j in range(start, w)] for i in range(h)]
        panels.append(panel)
    return panels
```
Panel extraction logic; row-based for vertical orient, column-based for horizontal; correctly splits excluding separators, key to isolating template/bg/acc.

```python
def extract_panels(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    w, h = get_dimensions(g)
    is_vertical_orient = h > w
    if is_vertical_orient:
        seps = find_horizontal_separators(g)
        return get_panel_rows(g, seps)
    else:
        seps = find_vertical_separators(g)
        return get_panel_columns(g, seps)
```
Top-level panel extractor; switches on orientation, foundational and worked for all training.

```python
def get_color(block: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not block:
        return 0
    colors = set()
    for row in block:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in (0, 1):
                colors.add(cell)
    return list(colors)[0] if colors else 0
```
Extracts the primary non-background/separator color from a panel; assumes single color per panel, simple but effective.

```python
def are_all_contiguous(template: List[List[int]], template_main: int, template_cross: int, out_cross: int) -> bool:
    if out_cross <= 0:
        return False
    for c in range(out_cross):
        slice_idx = 1 + c
        if slice_idx >= template_cross:
            return False
        filled = [j for j in range(template_main) if template[slice_idx][j] == 4]
        if filled:
            min_p = min(filled)
            max_p = max(filled)
            if max_p - min_p + 1 != len(filled):
                return False
    return True
```
Contiguity checker for horizontal orientation; verifies no gaps in 4-positions per slice, subtle but only used in horizontal, may be source of errors if misapplied.

```python
def build_motif_vertical(template: List[List[int]], slice_idx: int, template_main: int, bg_color: int, acc_color: int) -> List[int]:
    motif = []
    for r in range(1, template_main):
        val = template[r][slice_idx]
        color = bg_color if val == 4 else acc_color
        motif.append(color)
    return motif

def build_motif_horizontal(template: List[List[int]], slice_idx: int, template_main: int, bg_color: int, acc_color: int) -> List[int]:
    motif = []
    for j in range(1, template_main):
        val = template[slice_idx][j]
        color = bg_color if val == 4 else acc_color
        motif.append(color)
    return motif
```
Motif builders; vertical slices columns from rows 1 to main-1, horizontal slices rows from columns 1 to main-1; replace 4 with bg, others with acc; essential for pattern extraction.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully processed all 4 training examples correctly, indicating strong handling of panel extraction, color assignment, motif building, and tiling for both orientations in standard cases.
 * The program correctly identifies separators, extracts at least 4 panels (template + others + bg + acc), and generates tiled outputs using cyclic motif repetition, which worked for training.
 * In vertical orientation, output dimensions and tiling (out_main rows x out_cross cols) are consistent without adjustments, and this likely succeeded in training.
 * In horizontal orientation, the contiguity check and conditional addition of template_main to out_main worked for training but may be overly aggressive or incorrect in edge cases, as it alters size unexpectedly.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt assumes panels[-2] and panels[-1] for bg/acc, which is correct if exactly 4+ panels; early returns for invalid cases (e.g., <4 panels, 0 colors) prevent garbage outputs.
 * The are_all_contiguous function is helpful but subtle— it only checks slices with filled positions and requires solid blocks, which might miss sparse templates in training but passed.
 * build_motif functions skip index 0 (border?), focusing on inner template_main-1 positions, which aligned with training expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though get_panel_columns assumes uniform row lengths (potential crash if ragged, but assumes valid input).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x5 grid (10 rows, 5 columns) filled with colors 7 and 8 in a repeating pattern: rows 1-4, then repeat 5-8 same as 1-4, then rows 9-10 matching rows 1-2, suggesting a motif_length of 4 (template_main=5?) tiled cyclically over out_main=10 (2 full cycles + 2 partial).
 * Specific observed effects: Row 1: [8,8,7,8,8]; Row 2: [8,7,7,7,8]; Row 3: [8,8,8,8,8]; Row 4: [7,7,7,7,7]; this block repeats for rows 5-8, then partial for 9-10; uses 7 (likely accent) and 8 (likely bg) consistently, with full rows of one color in row 3/7 and row 4/8.
 * The output makes sense structurally as a vertical-orientation tiling (h=10 > w=5), with each column as a repeated motif from template slices (skipping borders, out_cross=5 implies template_w=7?), and cyclic repetition fits the code's logic (pos = i % motif_length).
 * However, it does not look fully correct because the pattern is identically repeated without variation across columns, which might indicate all template slices produced the same motif (possible if template is uniform), but expected output likely has column-specific variations based on different slice motifs; additionally, the partial cycle at the end (only 2 rows) is correct per code but could mismatch if out_main calculation (bg_main + acc_main -2=10) is off for the test input.
 * Difference from expected: Without test input grid, can't confirm, but the lack of diversity in columns (all seem to follow similar 4-row motif with bg=8, acc=7) suggests possible over-simplification in motif building (e.g., if template has identical slices or val!=4 everywhere treated as acc); expected might have more varied colors or no repetition if horizontal/contig adjusts differently; it's different in that training outputs were correct (implying varied patterns), but this is uniform-repeating, possibly indicating a bug in vertical motif extraction for this test (e.g., slice_idx logic or val==4 detection failing to differentiate slices).
 * To handle test: Update contiguity to apply symmetrically or debug horizontal case (if test is horizontal, w>h, output would be wide but shown is tall, so likely vertical; but if misoriented, swap); ensure motif builds check for non-4 values correctly (code uses acc for !=4, but template may have other nums); test input likely has vertical orient with bg/acc mains summing to 12-2=10, template cross=7.
