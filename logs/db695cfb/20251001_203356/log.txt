=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:33:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:40:49] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a diagonal connection puzzle on a grid where blue cells (represented by 1) are connected along backslash (constant r+c) and slash (constant r-c) diagonals if multiple blues exist on the same diagonal, filling the path with blue (1) while preserving or triggering special cells (6); hitting a 6 during connection triggers a full fill of the perpendicular diagonal type with 6 (another color or marker); there's also a bottom-row extension rule to propagate certain values upward under specific conditions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections only occur on diagonals with at least two 1's; isolated 1's or single 1's do not trigger filling or propagation.
 * During connection, paths are filled with 1 only on cells that are neither 1 nor 6; 6 cells are preserved but added to a trigger set (using the perpendicular diagonal index: r-c for backslash connections, r+c for slash connections).
 * Triggered diagonals are then fully filled with 6 on all non-1/non-6 cells along the entire diagonal, not just segments— this can create long chains of 6's across the grid.
 * The extend_bottom function attempts to propagate 1 or 6 from the bottom row (row h-1) upward to row h-2, but only if the upper cell is not already 1 or 6; this seems intended for boundary cases but is subtly buggy as it doesn't check for diagonal context or multiple rows, leading to overfills in some grids.
 * Background cells (e.g., 5, 8, 3) remain unchanged unless filled by rules; 6 acts as a "trigger" or "blocker" that preserves itself but initiates perpendicular fills.
 * Diagonals are indexed carefully: backslash by sum s = r + c (0 to h+w-2), slash by diff d = r - c (-(w-1) to h-1); edge cases like short diagonals or grid boundaries must not over-index.
 * Subtlety: Fills do not overwrite existing 1's or 6's, preserving original blues and triggers; order matters—connections first (blues), then triggered fills (6's), then bottom extension.
 * No horizontal/vertical connections; purely diagonal (both directions).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 15x12, 8x11, 15x16, 25x21), so functions must handle arbitrary h/w dynamically.
 * Potential miss: Trigger sets (triggered_back, triggered_slash) collect unique diagonal indices only from 6 hits during blue connections, not from pre-existing 6's alone.
 * Bottom extension is row-specific and vertical-only, not diagonal, and applies only if h >= 2; it may incorrectly propagate in cases where the bottom isn't part of a true connection.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly handles core diagonal connections for blues (1's) in training examples 3 and 5, filling paths accurately and triggering perpendicular 6-fills where multiple 1's align.
 * In training example 1 (15x12 grid with 5 background), generated output incorrectly adds extra 6's in bottom rows: e.g., row 13 starts with [6,6,5,...] instead of expected [5,6,5,...]; row 14 has [6,5,5,...] vs. expected [5,6,5,...]—likely due to extend_bottom over-propagating vertically without considering if the bottom is truly connected.
 * In training example 2 (8x11 grid with 8 background), generated has an extra 6 at row 6, column 8 ([8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8])—possibly from erroneous trigger fill or bottom extension affecting a non-connected area.
 * In training example 4 (15x16 grid with 8 background), multiple mismatches including extra 6's in row 13 ([8,8,8,8,8,6,8,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,8,8,6,8,...] wait, actually row 13 gen [8,8,8,1,6,6,8,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,1,6,8,...] with extra 6; row 14 gen [8,8,8,1,6,8,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,1,6,8,...] but earlier rows like row 0 gen has no issues but bottom overfills similar to train1—extend_bottom and possibly over-triggering diags are culprits.
 * Training examples 3 and 5 pass fully, indicating correct handling of simpler or balanced diagonal chains without bottom-edge issues.
 * The connect functions are helpful and accurate for identifying multi-1 diagonals and partial fills, but fill_full functions may overfill if triggers are added incorrectly (e.g., from non-connected 6's).
 * extend_bottom function is unhelpful/broken: it ignores diagonal context and blindly propagates, causing mismatches in bottom rows of train1,2,4; do not use without fixes (e.g., only propagate if bottom is part of a diagonal connection).
 * No extraction functions for objects like "blobs" are present or needed; the diagonal-grouping logic in connect functions serves this purpose effectively.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of diagonal connections and triggers but fails on boundary/edge cases, especially bottom propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (25x21 grid with 3 background) applies the connection and fill rules, producing a pattern of 1's (blues) along diagonals and 6's in triggered perpendicular lines, which looks plausible for a complex grid with many 1's—e.g., visible chains like in row 0 with 6's at cols 8 and 12, and dense 6/1 interactions in middle rows.
 * However, it does not look fully correct without the expected output, but based on training patterns, it may have similar overfills: e.g., row 23 has [3,6,6,1,3,...] with clustered 6's that could be from erroneous triggers or bottom extension (grid is tall at h=25, so extend_bottom only affects last two rows but might propagate wrongly if bottom has isolated 1/6).
 * Extra 6's appear in places like row 17 col 8-9 ([3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,1,...]) which might be overfills similar to train2's extra 6, suggesting the same trigger or extension bug.
 * The output makes sense for core rules (diagonal blues triggering 6's) but likely incorrect in bottom sections (rows 23-24) due to extend_bottom, and possibly some full-diagonal 6-fills extending too far without segment limits.
 * To handle test case, need to verify if bottom extensions are needed at all—perhaps remove or condition extend_bottom on diagonal membership to avoid mismatches seen in training.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 20:49:46] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (e.g., 8 or 3) and sparse placements of two colors (1 and 6), representing interrupted diagonal lines at 45-degree angles (main diagonals with slope 1 and anti-diagonals with slope -1). The goal is to complete these lines by filling background gaps along the same diagonal direction and, for interruptions by the opposite color, extending full perpendicular diagonals from those points using the interrupting color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Diagonals are strictly 45-degree: for main (slope 1), row difference equals absolute column difference; for anti (slope -1), row + column is constant.
 * Colors 1 and 6 are opposites; filling a group of one color skips positions of the other, treating them as interruptions.
 * After filling primary diagonals, interruptions trigger full-grid perpendicular fills (e.g., a main diagonal interruption fills the entire anti-diagonal through that point with the interrupting color).
 * Background detection uses the most common value; grids are square or rectangular but consistent.
 * Subtlety: Fills only occur on background cells; existing non-background cells are not overwritten. Positions must be collinear and sorted by row for valid groups (at least 2 points).
 * Easy to miss: Perpendicular fills are full lines across the entire grid (not just segments), but only on background cells. Multiple groups of the same color may exist, but the code aggregates all positions per color.
 * Groups with non-matching slope (e.g., vertical or irregular) are ignored. Skipped collections happen before filling to avoid modifying the grid prematurely.
 * In example 4, the code failed to propagate fills correctly from multiple interruptions, leaving gaps (e.g., expected 1 at [3][3] and chain of 1's downward, but generated only isolated placements).
 * Test input has wider grid (21 cols?); ensure column bounds are handled, and multiple short segments may need chaining if collinear.
 * No overwriting: If a perpendicular fill hits an existing cell of the same color, it's fine, but opposite colors block without fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled primary diagonal filling and basic perpendicular extensions for training examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, demonstrating understanding of collinear detection and gap-filling along 45-degree lines.
 * Failed on training example 4: Generated output only filled isolated 1's and 6's (e.g., 6 at [1][8], 1 at [2][2], 6 at [3][15], 1 at [4][14], etc.), but expected a chained fill of 1's diagonally downward from [2][2] (e.g., 1 at [3][3], [4][4], etc.) and more 6's/1's in perpendiculars (e.g., missing 1 at [3][3], 6 at [3][15] not propagating fully); this suggests the code did not handle multiple overlapping or chained interruptions properly, as skipped collections were aggregated but perpendicular fills may have been blocked or not triggered in sequence.
 * Worked for 4/5 training examples, indicating core diagonal grouping and filling logic is solid, but perpendicular propagation from skips is incomplete or order-dependent (e.g., filling primaries before skips collection is correct, but aggregating skips across colors without re-checking may miss cascades).
 * Position collection via defaultdict(list) per color is helpful and correctly identifies all non-bg points.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_background, fill_group, collect_skipped, fill_full_perp) are relevant, though collect_skipped assumes single group per color—may need extension for multi-group colors.
 * Deepcopy of grid prevents input mutation, which is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places some 1's and 6's (e.g., 1 at [1][9] and [1][17], 1 at [2][2], 6 at [4][4], 1 at [5][2], etc.), which seem to match initial sparse positions, but appears incomplete compared to expected behavior from training example 4—likely missing gap fills along diagonals (e.g., between 1 at [2][2] and [5][2], which are not collinear) and full perpendicular extensions (e.g., from any 6 interrupting a 1-line, no visible full anti/main diagonals filled).
 * Does not look fully correct: For instance, positions like 6 at [6][5] and 1 at [4][14] suggest potential diagonal groups, but no evident gap-filling (e.g., row 4-6 col 4-6 area has isolated 6/1 without connection), and wider grid (21 columns) may cause bound issues in fills; expected more dense diagonals similar to example 4's chaining.
 * Test output makes partial sense for initial detection but fails to propagate like in successful trainings, indicating the same flaw as example 4 (incomplete perpendicular chaining); unknown if wider grid exacerbates slope validation, but differences are clear in lack of full lines.

[2025-10-01 20:49:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a diagonal connection puzzle on a grid where blue cells (represented by 1) are connected along backslash (constant r+c) and slash (constant r-c) diagonals if multiple blues exist on the same diagonal, filling the path with blue (1) while preserving or triggering special cells (6); hitting a 6 during connection triggers a full fill of the perpendicular diagonal type with 6 (another color or marker); there's also a bottom-row extension rule to propagate certain values upward under specific conditions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connections only occur on diagonals with at least two 1's; isolated 1's or single 1's do not trigger filling or propagation.
 * During connection, paths are filled with 1 only on cells that are neither 1 nor 6; 6 cells are preserved but added to a trigger set (using the perpendicular diagonal index: r-c for backslash connections, r+c for slash connections).
 * Triggered diagonals are then fully filled with 6 on all non-1/non-6 cells along the entire diagonal, not just segments— this can create long chains of 6's across the grid.
 * The extend_bottom function attempts to propagate 1 or 6 from the bottom row (row h-1) upward to row h-2, but only if the upper cell is not already 1 or 6; this seems intended for boundary cases but is subtly buggy as it doesn't check for diagonal context or multiple rows, leading to overfills in some grids.
 * Background cells (e.g., 5, 8, 3) remain unchanged unless filled by rules; 6 acts as a "trigger" or "blocker" that preserves itself but initiates perpendicular fills.
 * Diagonals are indexed carefully: backslash by sum s = r + c (0 to h+w-2), slash by diff d = r - c (-(w-1) to h-1); edge cases like short diagonals or grid boundaries must not over-index.
 * Subtlety: Fills do not overwrite existing 1's or 6's, preserving original blues and triggers; order matters—connections first (blues), then triggered fills (6's), then bottom extension.
 * No horizontal/vertical connections; purely diagonal (both directions).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 15x12, 8x11, 15x16, 25x21), so functions must handle arbitrary h/w dynamically.
 * Potential miss: Trigger sets (triggered_back, triggered_slash) collect unique diagonal indices only from 6 hits during blue connections, not from pre-existing 6's alone.
 * Bottom extension is row-specific and vertical-only, not diagonal, and applies only if h >= 2; it may incorrectly propagate in cases where the bottom isn't part of a true connection.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly handles core diagonal connections for blues (1's) in training examples 3 and 5, filling paths accurately and triggering perpendicular 6-fills where multiple 1's align.
 * In training example 1 (15x12 grid with 5 background), generated output incorrectly adds extra 6's in bottom rows: e.g., row 13 starts with [6,6,5,...] instead of expected [5,6,5,...]; row 14 has [6,5,5,...] vs. expected [5,6,5,...]—likely due to extend_bottom over-propagating vertically without considering if the bottom is truly connected.
 * In training example 2 (8x11 grid with 8 background), generated has an extra 6 at row 6, column 8 ([8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8])—possibly from erroneous trigger fill or bottom extension affecting a non-connected area.
 * In training example 4 (15x16 grid with 8 background), multiple mismatches including extra 6's in row 13 ([8,8,8,8,8,6,8,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,8,8,6,8,...] wait, actually row 13 gen [8,8,8,1,6,6,8,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,1,6,8,...] with extra 6; row 14 gen [8,8,8,1,6,8,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,1,6,8,...] but earlier rows like row 0 gen has no issues but bottom overfills similar to train1—extend_bottom and possibly over-triggering diags are culprits.
 * Training examples 3 and 5 pass fully, indicating correct handling of simpler or balanced diagonal chains without bottom-edge issues.
 * The connect functions are helpful and accurate for identifying multi-1 diagonals and partial fills, but fill_full functions may overfill if triggers are added incorrectly (e.g., from non-connected 6's).
 * extend_bottom function is unhelpful/broken: it ignores diagonal context and blindly propagates, causing mismatches in bottom rows of train1,2,4; do not use without fixes (e.g., only propagate if bottom is part of a diagonal connection).
 * No extraction functions for objects like "blobs" are present or needed; the diagonal-grouping logic in connect functions serves this purpose effectively.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of diagonal connections and triggers but fails on boundary/edge cases, especially bottom propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (25x21 grid with 3 background) applies the connection and fill rules, producing a pattern of 1's (blues) along diagonals and 6's in triggered perpendicular lines, which looks plausible for a complex grid with many 1's—e.g., visible chains like in row 0 with 6's at cols 8 and 12, and dense 6/1 interactions in middle rows.
 * However, it does not look fully correct without the expected output, but based on training patterns, it may have similar overfills: e.g., row 23 has [3,6,6,1,3,...] with clustered 6's that could be from erroneous triggers or bottom extension (grid is tall at h=25, so extend_bottom only affects last two rows but might propagate wrongly if bottom has isolated 1/6).
 * Extra 6's appear in places like row 17 col 8-9 ([3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,1,...]) which might be overfills similar to train2's extra 6, suggesting the same trigger or extension bug.
 * The output makes sense for core rules (diagonal blues triggering 6's) but likely incorrect in bottom sections (rows 23-24) due to extend_bottom, and possibly some full-diagonal 6-fills extending too far without segment limits.
 * To handle test case, need to verify if bottom extensions are needed at all—perhaps remove or condition extend_bottom on diagonal membership to avoid mismatches seen in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (e.g., 8 or 3) and sparse placements of two colors (1 and 6), representing interrupted diagonal lines at 45-degree angles (main diagonals with slope 1 and anti-diagonals with slope -1). The goal is to complete these lines by filling background gaps along the same diagonal direction and, for interruptions by the opposite color, extending full perpendicular diagonals from those points using the interrupting color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Diagonals are strictly 45-degree: for main (slope 1), row difference equals absolute column difference; for anti (slope -1), row + column is constant.
 * Colors 1 and 6 are opposites; filling a group of one color skips positions of the other, treating them as interruptions.
 * After filling primary diagonals, interruptions trigger full-grid perpendicular fills (e.g., a main diagonal interruption fills the entire anti-diagonal through that point with the interrupting color).
 * Background detection uses the most common value; grids are square or rectangular but consistent.
 * Subtlety: Fills only occur on background cells; existing non-background cells are not overwritten. Positions must be collinear and sorted by row for valid groups (at least 2 points).
 * Easy to miss: Perpendicular fills are full lines across the entire grid (not just segments), but only on background cells. Multiple groups of the same color may exist, but the code aggregates all positions per color.
 * Groups with non-matching slope (e.g., vertical or irregular) are ignored. Skipped collections happen before filling to avoid modifying the grid prematurely.
 * In example 4, the code failed to propagate fills correctly from multiple interruptions, leaving gaps (e.g., expected 1 at [3][3] and chain of 1's downward, but generated only isolated placements).
 * Test input has wider grid (21 cols?); ensure column bounds are handled, and multiple short segments may need chaining if collinear.
 * No overwriting: If a perpendicular fill hits an existing cell of the same color, it's fine, but opposite colors block without fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled primary diagonal filling and basic perpendicular extensions for training examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, demonstrating understanding of collinear detection and gap-filling along 45-degree lines.
 * Failed on training example 4: Generated output only filled isolated 1's and 6's (e.g., 6 at [1][8], 1 at [2][2], 6 at [3][15], 1 at [4][14], etc.), but expected a chained fill of 1's diagonally downward from [2][2] (e.g., 1 at [3][3], [4][4], etc.) and more 6's/1's in perpendiculars (e.g., missing 1 at [3][3], 6 at [3][15] not propagating fully); this suggests the code did not handle multiple overlapping or chained interruptions properly, as skipped collections were aggregated but perpendicular fills may have been blocked or not triggered in sequence.
 * Worked for 4/5 training examples, indicating core diagonal grouping and filling logic is solid, but perpendicular propagation from skips is incomplete or order-dependent (e.g., filling primaries before skips collection is correct, but aggregating skips across colors without re-checking may miss cascades).
 * Position collection via defaultdict(list) per color is helpful and correctly identifies all non-bg points.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_background, fill_group, collect_skipped, fill_full_perp) are relevant, though collect_skipped assumes single group per color—may need extension for multi-group colors.
 * Deepcopy of grid prevents input mutation, which is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places some 1's and 6's (e.g., 1 at [1][9] and [1][17], 1 at [2][2], 6 at [4][4], 1 at [5][2], etc.), which seem to match initial sparse positions, but appears incomplete compared to expected behavior from training example 4—likely missing gap fills along diagonals (e.g., between 1 at [2][2] and [5][2], which are not collinear) and full perpendicular extensions (e.g., from any 6 interrupting a 1-line, no visible full anti/main diagonals filled).
 * Does not look fully correct: For instance, positions like 6 at [6][5] and 1 at [4][14] suggest potential diagonal groups, but no evident gap-filling (e.g., row 4-6 col 4-6 area has isolated 6/1 without connection), and wider grid (21 columns) may cause bound issues in fills; expected more dense diagonals similar to example 4's chaining.
 * Test output makes partial sense for initial detection but fails to propagate like in successful trainings, indicating the same flaw as example 4 (incomplete perpendicular chaining); unknown if wider grid exacerbates slope validation, but differences are clear in lack of full lines.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
