=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:42:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 16:49:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with background cells (likely 3 in the test case) and seed cells marked as 1 or 6, where the goal is to complete diagonal line segments (both backslash r-c constant and slash r+c constant) by filling in background cells along those diagonals if certain conditions are met, such as having at least two seeds on the same diagonal, while handling conflicts between 1s and 6s by prioritizing or fully extending 6s in overlapping cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Diagonals are strictly backslash (constant r - c) or slash (constant r + c); filling must stay within grid bounds and only overwrite background cells, not existing seeds or other colors.
 * For both 1s and 6s, segment filling triggers only if there are at least 2 seeds on the exact same diagonal line; isolated single seeds do not propagate.
 * Conflicts arise when a 6's diagonal overlaps with a 1's filled segment; in such cases, 6s may need full diagonal extension across the entire possible grid span for that diagonal, overriding background but respecting existing fills.
 * Background color (bg) is dynamically detected (e.g., grid[0][0]), and fills only target bg cells to avoid overwriting other content.
 * Order matters: process 1s first (both backslash and slash), then 6s, and finally handle 6 full fills based on conflicts with 1s' diagonals; this prevents 1s from blocking 6 extensions unintentionally.
 * Subtlety: Full fills for 6s in conflicts compute the entire possible row range for the diagonal (e.g., for slash, min_r = max(0, s - (ncols-1)), max_r = min(nrows-1, s)), ensuring complete lines even if seeds are sparse.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals can be short or partial; don't assume full grid span unless conflicting; also, multiple segments on the same diagonal type don't merge unless they share the exact diff/sum key.
 * Collect original seed positions before any filling to avoid modifying the list mid-process.
 * Grid is rectangular (nrows x ncols), and deep copy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential overfill: If a cell is filled by one diagonal but belongs to another's path, it won't be refilled if already non-bg, but conflicts might require re-evaluation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def fill_backslash(grid: List[List[int]], diff: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, color: int, bg: int, nrows: int, ncols: int):

        if 0 <= c < ncols and grid[r][c] == bg:
            grid[r][c] = color

def fill_slash(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, color: int, bg: int, nrows: int, ncols: int):
    """
    Fills a slash diagonal (constant r + c = s) from min_r to max_r with color, only overwriting bg.
    Symmetric to fill_backslash but for the other diagonal direction.
    """
    for r in range(max(0, min_r), min(nrows, max_r + 1)):
        c = s - r
        if 0 <= c < ncols and grid[r][c] == bg:
            grid[r][c] = color
```

```python
def extract_seeds(grid: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    """
    Extracts positions of 1s and 6s before processing; useful for grouping by diagonals without mid-fill interference.
    Returns orig_ones: List[tuple[r,c]], orig_sixes: List[tuple[r,c]].
    """
    nrows, ncols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    orig_ones = [(r, c) for r in range(nrows) for c in range(ncols) if grid[r][c] == 1]
    orig_sixes = [(r, c) for r in range(nrows) for c in range(ncols) if grid[r][c] == 6]
    return orig_ones, orig_sixes
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed all 5 training examples, indicating strong handling of basic segment filling for 1s and 6s on non-conflicting diagonals.
 * What worked: Grouping seeds by diagonal keys (diff for backslash, sum for slash) using defaultdict(list) correctly identifies segments with >=2 seeds, and the fill functions properly extend only bg cells within bounds.
 * What worked: Detecting bg dynamically and using deep copy prevents input mutation; processing 1s before 6s avoids premature blocking.
 * What didn't work: The full fill logic for conflicting 6s (extending entire diagonal if a 6's diff/sum overlaps a 1's filled diagonal) may overextend in cases where the conflict is local rather than global, potentially filling beyond intended segments (though this didn't fail training).
 * Subtle issue: Conflicting_diffs/sums are collected only from segments with >=2, but single 6s in conflict might not trigger full fill correctly if their exact position isn't checked against the set.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but if a function ignored single seeds entirely (e.g., no propagation for isolates), it would be broken— this attempt correctly leaves isolates unfilled.
 * Overall, core diagonal filling is demonstrated, but test case may reveal edge cases in conflict resolution or large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 25x21 grid (25 rows of 21 integers each), mostly filled with 3 (likely bg), with scattered 1s and 6s forming partial diagonal patterns (e.g., visible short backslashes of 6s in rows 0-4, slashes of 1s in rows 5-10).
 * It makes partial sense as an extension of seeds: clusters like 6s on diff=constant in upper-left and 1s on slashes in mid-grid suggest segment filling worked, but some lines look incomplete (e.g., row 0 has isolated 6 at end, row 5 has a 1-6 mix that might indicate unresolved conflict).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected full diagonal extensions for conflicting 6s are missing in places (e.g., a 6 in row 6 col 2 should likely fill its entire backslash if conflicting with a 1 segment, but nearby cells remain 3); this differs from expected by leaving gaps in what should be solid lines, possibly due to the full fill only triggering per-orig_six rather than per-conflicting-diagonal.
 * Another difference: Some 1 segments (e.g., in row 18, positions suggesting a slash) are filled minimally but not extended to grid edges even if >=2 seeds, unlike training expectations where segments fully connect within their row range.
 * Overall, the output demonstrates understanding of basic filling but fails to produce clean, complete diagonals, indicating the conflict/full-fill logic needs refinement for larger/sparser test grids—it's different from expected complete patterns by having more isolated fills and unfilled bg in diagonal paths.

    """
    Extracts positions of 1s and 6s before processing; useful for grouping by diagonals without mid-fill interference.
    Returns orig_ones: List[tuple[r,c]], orig_sixes: List[tuple[r,c]].
    """
    nrows, ncols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    orig_ones = [(r, c) for r in range(nrows) for c in range(ncols) if grid[r][c] == 1]

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed all 5 training examples, indicating strong handling of basic segment filling for 1s and 6s on non-conflicting diagonals.
 * What worked: Grouping seeds by diagonal keys (diff for backslash, sum for slash) using defaultdict(list) correctly identifies segments with >=2 seeds, and the fill functions properly extend only bg cells within bounds.
 * What worked: Detecting bg dynamically and using deep copy prevents input mutation; processing 1s before 6s avoids premature blocking.
 * What didn't work: The full fill logic for conflicting 6s (extending entire diagonal if a 6's diff/sum overlaps a 1's filled diagonal) may overextend in cases where the conflict is local rather than global, potentially filling beyond intended segments (though this didn't fail training).
 * Subtle issue: Conflicting_diffs/sums are collected only from segments with >=2, but single 6s in conflict might not trigger full fill correctly if their exact position isn't checked against the set.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but if a function ignored single seeds entirely (e.g., no propagation for isolates), it would be broken— this attempt correctly leaves isolates unfilled.
 * Overall, core diagonal filling is demonstrated, but test case may reveal edge cases in conflict resolution or large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 25x21 grid (25 rows of 21 integers each), mostly filled with 3 (likely bg), with scattered 1s and 6s forming partial diagonal patterns (e.g., visible short backslashes of 6s in rows 0-4, slashes of 1s in rows 5-10).
 * It makes partial sense as an extension of seeds: clusters like 6s on diff=constant in upper-left and 1s on slashes in mid-grid suggest segment filling worked, but some lines look incomplete (e.g., row 0 has isolated 6 at end, row 5 has a 1-6 mix that might indicate unresolved conflict).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected full diagonal extensions for conflicting 6s are missing in places (e.g., a 6 in row 6 col 2 should likely fill its entire backslash if conflicting with a 1 segment, but nearby cells remain 3); this differs from expected by leaving gaps in what should be solid lines, possibly due to the full fill only triggering per-orig_six rather than per-conflicting-diagonal.
 * Another difference: Some 1 segments (e.g., in row 18, positions suggesting a slash) are filled minimally but not extended to grid edges even if >=2 seeds, unlike training expectations where segments fully connect within their row range.
 * Overall, the output demonstrates understanding of basic filling but fails to produce clean, complete diagonals, indicating the conflict/full-fill logic needs refinement for larger/sparser test grids—it's different from expected complete patterns by having more isolated fills and unfilled bg in diagonal paths.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 16:53:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids where background cells (e.g., 5, 8, or 3) are filled along diagonal lines (backslash r-c and slash r+c directions) based on clusters of 1s and 6s, extending segments only if they meet a minimum length threshold (e.g., >=2 cells), with 6s taking priority and overwriting 1s or background, while isolated 1s or 6s may remain unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Diagonals are strictly defined: backslash uses r - c constant (decreasing slope), slash uses r + c constant (increasing slope); filling must respect grid boundaries and only extend within valid rows/columns.
 * Segments are filled only if a group has >=2 matching cells (1s or 6s); isolated singles do not extend, leaving them as-is (e.g., expected outputs show scattered 1s where no extension occurs).
 * Prioritization: 6s overwrite 1s (and background) even on conflicting diagonals; 1s do not overwrite anything except background, and only extend their own segments without affecting 6s.
 * Full grid-spanning fills for 6s on diagonals that conflict with 1s (e.g., if a diagonal has both, extend 6s across the entire possible diagonal range, overwriting 1s).
 * Background detection: Assumes top-left cell as bg, but must handle varying bg values across examples (5, 8, 3); overwrites only bg or (conditionally) 1s, never other numbers.
 * Contiguous vs. full extension: Fills are along the min-max row range of the group, not necessarily the entire diagonal; however, in conflicts, extend to full diagonal bounds (e.g., max(0, diff) to min(nrows-1, ncols-1 + diff) for backslash).
 * Subtle omissions: Do not fill non-bg/non-1 cells; preserve isolated 1s/6s; handle multiple overlapping diagonals without infinite loops (process 1s first, then 6s).
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., 15x12, 8x11, 21x11); 1s and 6s may be sparse or clustered; no filling if <2 in group.
 * Overwrite flags: Use optional overwrite_1=True only for 6s to replace existing 1s, but False for 1s to avoid self-overwrite or affecting 6s.

            if cell == bg or (overwrite_1 and cell == 1):
                grid[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identified core diagonal grouping via defaultdict on r-c (backslash) and r+c (slash), and extracted orig_ones/orig_sixes lists for targeting specific colors.
 * Correctly processed 1s first (no overwrite), then 6s (with overwrite_1=True), which worked for Train 3 and 5 where no major conflicts occurred.
 * The full-fill logic for conflicting diagonals (e.g., checking back_1_keys/slash_1_keys and extending 6s to full bounds) partially handled prioritization but over-applied in Train 1, filling extra 6s (e.g., generated row 2 has 6s at cols 0 and 9, but expected has none there; instead expected has isolated 1s like row 3 col 1).
 * In Train 1, generated a simple descending 6-diagonal from (2,0) but missed scattered 1s (e.g., expected row 3 col 1=1, row 4 col 2=1, row 6 col 4=1) and complex 6/1 mixes (e.g., expected row 0 col 8=6, row 1 col 7=6, but generated ignores them); also extra 5s where expected has 6s (e.g., generated row 13 col 4=6 but expected row 13 col 4=6 is correct, wait no—mismatch in row 13 col 11=6 generated vs expected row 13 col 11=5? Wait, grids differ in structure).
 * Train 2 generated a backslash 6-diagonal from bottom-left upward but missed 1s entirely (e.g., expected row 1 col 6=1, row 2 col 5=1, row 4 col 3=1; generated has only 6s and 8s, no 1s preserved); overfilled 6s (e.g., generated row 0 col 7=6 but expected row 0 col 1=6 instead).
 * Train 4 generated some 1s (e.g., row 3 col 12=1) but misplaced 6s (e.g., generated row 0 col 0=6 but expected row 0 all 8s; generated row 1 col 8=6 but expected row 1 col 8=6 correct, but row 10 col 1=6 vs expected row 10 col 1=6? Mismatches like generated row 14 col 3=1 but expected row 14 col 3=1 correct, but overall extra 6s in row 1 col 1=6 vs expected row 1 col 8=6 and isolated 1s missed like row 2 col 2=1).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" beyond simple lists; the deepcopy and bg detection are helpful but assume uniform bg—unhelpful if bg varies within grid (not the case here).
 * The conflict full-fill overextended in Train 1/4, filling beyond segment min-max (e.g., in Train 4, generated row 14 col 14=6 but expected has 6 at col 14=6? But structure shows generated has extra fills like row 3 col 3=6 vs expected sparse).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: it correctly extends 6-clusters into diagonals (e.g., row 0 col 0=6 extends down-right backslash; row 6 col 20=6 seems extended from a cluster), preserves some isolated 1s (e.g., row 1 col 9=1, row 1 col 17=1, row 2 col 16=1), and uses 3 as bg without overwriting non-targets.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: some 6-fills seem overextended (e.g., row 14 col 11=6 and col 12=6 might be from a short cluster but filled fully, potentially missing priority checks; compare to Train 1 where similar overfill ignored isolated 1s—here row 23 col 11=1 is preserved but may need extension if clustered). Isolated 1s like row 23 col 11=1 look right, but potential misses in slash directions (e.g., row 7 col 14=6 and row 8 col 15=6? Wait, generated has row 7 col 19=6 but sparse—unclear without expected, but pattern suggests underfilling some 1-clusters >=2, as in Train 2 where 1s vanished). Overall, it captures diagonal extension but likely mishandles conflicts/short segments, leaving potential unfilled >=2 1s (e.g., row 1 has two 1s far apart, not grouped/filled).

[2025-10-01 16:53:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids where background cells (e.g., 5, 8, or 3) are filled along diagonal lines (backslash r-c and slash r+c directions) based on clusters of 1s and 6s, extending segments only if they meet a minimum length threshold (e.g., >=2 cells), with 6s taking priority and overwriting 1s or background, while isolated 1s or 6s may remain unfilled.

 * Segments are filled only if a group has >=2 matching cells (1s or 6s); isolated singles do not extend, leaving them as-is (e.g., expected outputs show scattered 1s where no extension occurs).
 * Prioritization: 6s overwrite 1s (and background) even on conflicting diagonals; 1s do not overwrite anything except background, and only extend their own segments without affecting 6s.

 * Subtle omissions: Do not fill non-bg/non-1 cells; preserve isolated 1s/6s; handle multiple overlapping diagonals without infinite loops (process 1s first, then 6s).
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., 15x12, 8x11, 21x11); 1s and 6s may be sparse or clustered; no filling if <2 in group.
 * Overwrite flags: Use optional overwrite_1=True only for 6s to replace existing 1s, but False for 1s to avoid self-overwrite or affecting 6s.

Wait, generated has row 7 col 19=6 but sparse—unclear without expected, but pattern suggests underfilling some 1-clusters >=2, as in Train 2 where 1s vanished). Overall, it captures diagonal extension but likely mishandles conflicts/short segments, leaving potential unfilled >=2 1s (e.g., row 1 has two 1s far apart, not grouped/filled).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with background cells (likely 3 in the test case) and seed cells marked as 1 or 6, where the goal is to complete diagonal line segments (both backslash r-c constant and slash r+c constant) by filling in background cells along those diagonals if certain conditions are met, such as having at least two seeds on the same diagonal, while handling conflicts between 1s and 6s by prioritizing or fully extending 6s in overlapping cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Diagonals are strictly backslash (constant r - c) or slash (constant r + c); filling must stay within grid bounds and only overwrite background cells, not existing seeds or other colors.
 * For both 1s and 6s, segment filling triggers only if there are at least 2 seeds on the exact same diagonal line; isolated single seeds do not propagate.
 * Conflicts arise when a 6's diagonal overlaps with a 1's filled segment; in such cases, 6s may need full diagonal extension across the entire possible grid span for that diagonal, overriding background but respecting existing fills.
 * Background color (bg) is dynamically detected (e.g., grid[0][0]), and fills only target bg cells to avoid overwriting other content.
 * Order matters: process 1s first (both backslash and slash), then 6s, and finally handle 6 full fills based on conflicts with 1s' diagonals; this prevents 1s from blocking 6 extensions unintentionally.
 * Subtlety: Full fills for 6s in conflicts compute the entire possible row range for the diagonal (e.g., for slash, min_r = max(0, s - (ncols-1)), max_r = min(nrows-1, s)), ensuring complete lines even if seeds are sparse.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals can be short or partial; don't assume full grid span unless conflicting; also, multiple segments on the same diagonal type don't merge unless they share the exact diff/sum key.
 * Collect original seed positions before any filling to avoid modifying the list mid-process.
 * Grid is rectangular (nrows x ncols), and deep copy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential overfill: If a cell is filled by one diagonal but belongs to another's path, it won't be refilled if already non-bg, but conflicts might require re-evaluation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict

        c = r - diff
        if 0 <= c < ncols and grid[r][c] == bg:
            grid[r][c] = color

def fill_slash(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, color: int, bg: int, nrows: int, ncols: int):
    """
    Fills a slash diagonal (constant r + c = s) from min_r to max_r with color, only overwriting bg.
    Symmetric to fill_backslash but for the other diagonal direction.

            grid[r][c] = color
```

```python
def extract_seeds(grid: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    """
    Extracts positions of 1s and 6s before processing; useful for grouping by diagonals without mid-fill interference.
    Returns orig_ones: List[tuple[r,c]], orig_sixes: List[tuple[r,c]].

    nrows, ncols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    orig_ones = [(r, c) for r in range(nrows) for c in range(ncols) if grid[r][c] == 1]
    orig_sixes = [(r, c) for r in range(nrows) for c in range(ncols) if grid[r][c] == 6]
    return orig_ones, orig_sixes
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed all 5 training examples, indicating strong handling of basic segment filling for 1s and 6s on non-conflicting diagonals.
 * What worked: Grouping seeds by diagonal keys (diff for backslash, sum for slash) using defaultdict(list) correctly identifies segments with >=2 seeds, and the fill functions properly extend only bg cells within bounds.
 * What worked: Detecting bg dynamically and using deep copy prevents input mutation; processing 1s before 6s avoids premature blocking.
 * What didn't work: The full fill logic for conflicting 6s (extending entire diagonal if a 6's diff/sum overlaps a 1's filled diagonal) may overextend in cases where the conflict is local rather than global, potentially filling beyond intended segments (though this didn't fail training).
 * Subtle issue: Conflicting_diffs/sums are collected only from segments with >=2, but single 6s in conflict might not trigger full fill correctly if their exact position isn't checked against the set.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but if a function ignored single seeds entirely (e.g., no propagation for isolates), it would be broken— this attempt correctly leaves isolates unfilled.
 * Overall, core diagonal filling is demonstrated, but test case may reveal edge cases in conflict resolution or large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 25x21 grid (25 rows of 21 integers each), mostly filled with 3 (likely bg), with scattered 1s and 6s forming partial diagonal patterns (e.g., visible short backslashes of 6s in rows 0-4, slashes of 1s in rows 5-10).
 * It makes partial sense as an extension of seeds: clusters like 6s on diff=constant in upper-left and 1s on slashes in mid-grid suggest segment filling worked, but some lines look incomplete (e.g., row 0 has isolated 6 at end, row 5 has a 1-6 mix that might indicate unresolved conflict).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected full diagonal extensions for conflicting 6s are missing in places (e.g., a 6 in row 6 col 2 should likely fill its entire backslash if conflicting with a 1 segment, but nearby cells remain 3); this differs from expected by leaving gaps in what should be solid lines, possibly due to the full fill only triggering per-orig_six rather than per-conflicting-diagonal.
 * Another difference: Some 1 segments (e.g., in row 18, positions suggesting a slash) are filled minimally but not extended to grid edges even if >=2 seeds, unlike training expectations where segments fully connect within their row range.
 * Overall, the output demonstrates understanding of basic filling but fails to produce clean, complete diagonals, indicating the conflict/full-fill logic needs refinement for larger/sparser test grids—it's different from expected complete patterns by having more isolated fills and unfilled bg in diagonal paths.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 17:01:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a diagonal-filling puzzle on a grid with a background color (detected from top-left cell, e.g., 3) and seed cells marked as 1 or 6. The goal is to fill entire segments (or full diagonals in conflict cases) along backslash (r - c constant) and slash (r + c constant) diagonals with the seed color if there are at least two seeds on that diagonal, overwriting only background or (in conflicts) opposing seeds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell value (e.g., 3); do not assume it's 0 or fixed—detect dynamically.
 * Seeds are only 1s and 6s; extract their positions first, then group by diagonal keys: backslash uses (r - c), slash uses (r + c).
 * Fill only segments with >=2 seeds: compute min_r and max_r from the seed rows in the group, and fill the contiguous diagonal segment between them, overwriting only background (not opposing seeds initially).
 * Process 1s first (both diagonal types), then 6s (both types), to prioritize 1 fills.
 * Conflicts arise when a 6 is on a diagonal that already has a filled 1-segment: for such 6s, perform a full perpendicular fill (e.g., if conflict on backslash, full-fill the slash diagonal passing through the 6, overwriting 1s).
 * Full fills for conflicts span the entire possible diagonal within grid bounds (e.g., for slash, min_r = max(0, s - (ncols-1)), max_r = min(nrows-1, s)).
 * Do not overwrite non-background/non-target cells during initial fills; only overwrite in conflict resolutions.
 * Grid is rectangular (nrows x ncols); handle edge cases like short diagonals or single seeds (no fill).
 * Subtlety: Grouping appends rows (r), not positions, since diagonals are row-sorted; ensure fill functions iterate r and compute c correctly.
 * No filling for isolated seeds (<2 on diagonal); preserve them as-is.
 * Deepcopy the grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Easy to miss: Conflict detection uses sets of keys from 1-groups with >=2; only check per-6 position's diagonals.
 * No other colors or rules (e.g., no horizontal/vertical fills, no counting lengths beyond >=2 threshold).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) successfully passed all 5 training examples, demonstrating correct implementation of seed extraction, diagonal grouping, segment filling for >=2 seeds, and conflict resolution via perpendicular full fills.
 * No prior attempts shown, but the core logic (prioritizing 1s, then 6s, handling overwrites only in conflicts) worked perfectly for training cases, including edge cases like short segments or multiple diagonals per color.
 * No misses in training: all outputs matched expected filled diagonals without extraneous overwrites.
 * Functions like detect_bg, extract_seeds, group_by_backslash/slash, fill_backslash/slash, fill_segments, and handle_conflicts are all essential and correct—reuse them as the foundation.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided utilities align with the puzzle (e.g., no irrelevant blob detection or horizontal fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 25x21 grid (inferred from 25 lines of 21 values each) with background 3s mostly preserved, and 1s/6s filled along diagonal segments and full lines where applicable.
 * It looks correct overall: visible diagonal runs of 1s (e.g., around row 2 col 2, row 3 col 3) and 6s (e.g., longer slash in rows 0-1 cols 8-9), with apparent conflict resolutions like full slash fills overwriting 1s (e.g., vertical-ish 6s in col 17 rows 12-21).
 * Specific observed effects: Many short 1-segments filled (e.g., 2-3 cells), longer 6-runs (4+ cells), and full edge-to-edge 6-diagonals (e.g., backslash in row 8 col 0 to row 12 col 4), which match rules for >=2 seeds and conflicts.
 * No obvious errors: No isolated seeds filled, no non-diagonal fills, overwrites seem targeted (e.g., 1s turned to 6s in conflict areas like row 17 col 9-10).
 * Subtle match: Background 3s remain unfilled where no seeds qualify; grid bounds respected (no out-of-bounds fills).
 * It aligns with expected output based on mentally simulating rules—e.g., a 6 at row 0 col 8 likely triggers a segment fill, and conflicts propagate perpendicularly without overfilling.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the interactions, connections, and effects that are consistent across **every** train example (1 through 5). These are based on obvious, repeatable patterns in positions, colors, and properties (e.g., bbox coordinates, holes, pixels) between inputs and outputs. I focused solely on elements that interact or affect each other, such as small shapes influencing paths or the background. Irrelevant elements (e.g., the uniform background color change mentioned in the query, which does not appear in the data) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., pink chain extensions, which occur in train 1, 2, and 4 but not 3 or 5) are not included. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained consistently (e.g., due to splits), it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Small Blue Shapes ↔ Small Blue Shapes (Path Connection via Position)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small blue shapes (color: blue, holes=0, pixels=1, bbox as single points).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: When two or more small blue shapes are present and at least one pair is aligned diagonally (i.e., the absolute difference in x-coordinates |Δx| equals the absolute difference in y-coordinates |Δy|, and |Δx| > 0), they interact by forming a connected diagonal chain in the output. Intermediate positions along the shortest diagonal path (stepping ±1 in x and ±1 in y each step, matching the sign of Δx and Δy) are filled with new small blue shapes (same properties: holes=0, pixels=1). This adds new blue shapes equal to the path length minus the input blues on that path (e.g., for |Δx|=|Δy|=n, adds n-1 blues if no interruptions). The path direction is determined by the positions (bbox coordinates) of the input blues.
     - Consistent in every train: Train 1 (|Δx|=|Δy|=6, adds 3 blues skipping pinks); Train 2 (|Δx|=|Δy|=5, adds 3 blues skipping 1 pink); Train 3 (|Δx|=|Δy|=6, adds 5 blues, no skips); Train 4 (one pair with |Δx|=|Δy|=9, adds 7 blues skipping 1 pink; other blues not aligned, so no path for them); Train 5 (|Δx|=|Δy|=5, adds 4 blues, no skips).
   - **Properties Affected**: Position (bbox) of input blues determines path start/end and thus new blue positions; no change to color, holes, or pixels of existing blues.
   - **No Interaction If**: No aligned pair (e.g., in train 4, two blues have no aligned partner, so they remain isolated without added blues connecting them).

#### 2. **Small Pink Shapes ↔ Small Blue Path Formation (Interruption via Position)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small pink shapes (color: pink, holes=0, pixels=1, bbox as single points) and the diagonal paths formed by blue shapes (as in #1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: If a small pink shape's position (bbox) lies exactly on the diagonal path between aligned input blue shapes, it interrupts the blue chain: no new blue shape is added at that position, but the pink remains unchanged, and the blue chain continues on adjacent positions. This maintains the overall connection between the blues without altering the pink or breaking the path logic.
     - Consistent in every train where applicable: Train 1 (2 pinks on path, skips add 3 blues instead of 5); Train 2 (1 pink on path, skips add 3 blues instead of 5); Train 3 (pink not on path, no interruption); Train 4 (1 pink on one blue path, skips add 7 blues instead of 8; no pinks on other potential paths); Train 5 (no pinks, no interruption).
   - **Properties Affected**: Position (bbox) of pink determines if/where it interrupts; no change to pink's color, holes, pixels, or position. Affects number of added blues (reduces by number of interrupting pinks).
   - **No Effect If**: Pink position not on a blue path (e.g., train 3 pink at [7,6], off the [7,1] to [1,7] path).

#### 3. **Input Small Shapes (Blue and Pink) ↔ Output Preservation (No Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: All input small shapes (blue or pink; holes=0, pixels=1, bbox as single points).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: All input small shapes (regardless of color) are preserved unchanged in the output: exact same position (bbox coordinates), color, holes=0, and pixels=1. No input small shape is removed, moved, resized, or recolored. This is a direct effect of their presence in the input affecting the output composition.
     - Consistent in every train: All input blues and pinks (e.g., train 1: 2 blues + 5 pinks preserved; train 3: 2 blues + 1 pink preserved; train 5: 2 blues preserved, no pinks).
   - **Properties Affected**: None (preservation means no transformation); their positions indirectly affect #1 and #2.

#### 4. **Added Small Shapes (Blue and Pink) ↔ Large Background Shape (Pixel and Hole Modification)**
   - **Components Involved**: New small shapes added in output (blue or pink; from #1 or preservation in #3; holes=0, pixels=1) and the large background shape (variable color like orange/maroon/yellow; holes ≥0, large bbox covering [0,0,W,H], large pixels >>1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Added small shapes (from blue paths or preservation) interact with the background by being "carved" into it: the background's total pixel count decreases by the number of added small shapes (each subtracts 1 pixel from background). The background color remains unchanged. In non-split cases, the background's hole count increases by exactly the number of added blue shapes (pinks do not affect holes).
     - Consistent in every train for pixel decrease: Train 1 (adds ~17 small, background total pixels 174 → 152, -22; approximate due to split); Train 2 (adds 10 small, 85 → 75, -10); Train 3 (adds 5 blues, 105 → 100, -5); Train 4 (adds ~20 small, 232 → 151 + 63 = 214, -18; approximate due to split); Train 5 (adds 4 blues, 79 → 75, -4).
     - Consistent in every non-split train for holes: Train 3 (adds 5 blues, holes 3 → 8, +5); Train 5 (adds 4 blues, 2 → 6, +4). (No added pinks affect holes in these.)
   - **Properties Affected**: Background pixels decrease (position of added smalls determines subtraction locations, but not explicitly mappable); background holes increase by added blues (in non-split cases). Background bbox may shrink or split (see unknown below).
   - **Unknown Transformation**: In split cases (train 1, 2, 4), background splits into 2–4 components (same color, smaller bboxes, some overlapping), total pixels still decrease but hole changes are inconsistent (e.g., train 2: holes 3 → 5 total, +2 despite +3 added blues; train 1: 6 → 5 total, -1). Condition for splitting unknown (e.g., occurs with multiple paths or pinks, but not when only blues and |Δx|=|Δy| small).

No other interactions are consistent across all examples (e.g., no consistent pink-to-pink paths, as they vary or absent; no color changes; no effects from shape silhouettes/edges beyond positions; no movement of existing shapes). Grid-like distribution is observed but not an interaction (just spatial pattern, no causal effect).

[2025-10-01 17:05:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids where background cells (e.g., 5, 8, or 3) are filled along diagonal lines (backslash r-c and slash r+c directions) based on clusters of 1s and 6s, extending segments only if they meet a minimum length threshold (e.g., >=2 cells), with 6s taking priority and overwriting 1s or background, while isolated 1s or 6s may remain unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Diagonals are strictly defined: backslash uses r - c constant (decreasing slope), slash uses r + c constant (increasing slope); filling must respect grid boundaries and only extend within valid rows/columns.
 * Segments are filled only if a group has >=2 matching cells (1s or 6s); isolated singles do not extend, leaving them as-is (e.g., expected outputs show scattered 1s where no extension occurs).
 * Prioritization: 6s overwrite 1s (and background) even on conflicting diagonals; 1s do not overwrite anything except background, and only extend their own segments without affecting 6s.
 * Full grid-spanning fills for 6s on diagonals that conflict with 1s (e.g., if a diagonal has both, extend 6s across the entire possible diagonal range, overwriting 1s).
 * Background detection: Assumes top-left cell as bg, but must handle varying bg values across examples (5, 8, 3); overwrites only bg or (conditionally) 1s, never other numbers.
 * Contiguous vs. full extension: Fills are along the min-max row range of the group, not necessarily the entire diagonal; however, in conflicts, extend to full diagonal bounds (e.g., max(0, diff) to min(nrows-1, ncols-1 + diff) for backslash).
 * Subtle omissions: Do not fill non-bg/non-1 cells; preserve isolated 1s/6s; handle multiple overlapping diagonals without infinite loops (process 1s first, then 6s).
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., 15x12, 8x11, 21x11); 1s and 6s may be sparse or clustered; no filling if <2 in group.
 * Overwrite flags: Use optional overwrite_1=True only for 6s to replace existing 1s, but False for 1s to avoid self-overwrite or affecting 6s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def fill_backslash(grid: List[List[int]], diff: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, color: int, bg: int, nrows: int, ncols: int, overwrite_1: bool = False) -> None:
    # Fills backslash diagonal (r - c = diff) from min_r to max_r with color, overwriting bg or (if flag) 1s; bounds-checked.
    for r in range(max(0, min_r), min(nrows, max_r + 1)):
        c = r - diff
        if 0 <= c < ncols:
            cell = grid[r][c]
            if cell == bg or (overwrite_1 and cell == 1):
                grid[r][c] = color
```

```python
def fill_slash(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, color: int, bg: int, nrows: int, ncols: int, overwrite_1: bool = False) -> None:
    # Fills slash diagonal (r + c = s) from min_r to max_r with color, overwriting bg or (if flag) 1s; bounds-checked.
    for r in range(max(0, min_r), min(nrows, max_r + 1)):
        c = s - r
        if 0 <= c < ncols:
            cell = grid[r][c]
            if cell == bg or (overwrite_1 and cell == 1):
                grid[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identified core diagonal grouping via defaultdict on r-c (backslash) and r+c (slash), and extracted orig_ones/orig_sixes lists for targeting specific colors.
 * Correctly processed 1s first (no overwrite), then 6s (with overwrite_1=True), which worked for Train 3 and 5 where no major conflicts occurred.
 * The full-fill logic for conflicting diagonals (e.g., checking back_1_keys/slash_1_keys and extending 6s to full bounds) partially handled prioritization but over-applied in Train 1, filling extra 6s (e.g., generated row 2 has 6s at cols 0 and 9, but expected has none there; instead expected has isolated 1s like row 3 col 1).
 * In Train 1, generated a simple descending 6-diagonal from (2,0) but missed scattered 1s (e.g., expected row 3 col 1=1, row 4 col 2=1, row 6 col 4=1) and complex 6/1 mixes (e.g., expected row 0 col 8=6, row 1 col 7=6, but generated ignores them); also extra 5s where expected has 6s (e.g., generated row 13 col 4=6 but expected row 13 col 4=6 is correct, wait no—mismatch in row 13 col 11=6 generated vs expected row 13 col 11=5? Wait, grids differ in structure).
 * Train 2 generated a backslash 6-diagonal from bottom-left upward but missed 1s entirely (e.g., expected row 1 col 6=1, row 2 col 5=1, row 4 col 3=1; generated has only 6s and 8s, no 1s preserved); overfilled 6s (e.g., generated row 0 col 7=6 but expected row 0 col 1=6 instead).
 * Train 4 generated some 1s (e.g., row 3 col 12=1) but misplaced 6s (e.g., generated row 0 col 0=6 but expected row 0 all 8s; generated row 1 col 8=6 but expected row 1 col 8=6 correct, but row 10 col 1=6 vs expected row 10 col 1=6? Mismatches like generated row 14 col 3=1 but expected row 14 col 3=1 correct, but overall extra 6s in row 1 col 1=6 vs expected row 1 col 8=6 and isolated 1s missed like row 2 col 2=1).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" beyond simple lists; the deepcopy and bg detection are helpful but assume uniform bg—unhelpful if bg varies within grid (not the case here).
 * The conflict full-fill overextended in Train 1/4, filling beyond segment min-max (e.g., in Train 4, generated row 14 col 14=6 but expected has 6 at col 14=6? But structure shows generated has extra fills like row 3 col 3=6 vs expected sparse).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: it correctly extends 6-clusters into diagonals (e.g., row 0 col 0=6 extends down-right backslash; row 6 col 20=6 seems extended from a cluster), preserves some isolated 1s (e.g., row 1 col 9=1, row 1 col 17=1, row 2 col 16=1), and uses 3 as bg without overwriting non-targets.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: some 6-fills seem overextended (e.g., row 14 col 11=6 and col 12=6 might be from a short cluster but filled fully, potentially missing priority checks; compare to Train 1 where similar overfill ignored isolated 1s—here row 23 col 11=1 is preserved but may need extension if clustered). Isolated 1s like row 23 col 11=1 look right, but potential misses in slash directions (e.g., row 7 col 14=6 and row 8 col 15=6? Wait, generated has row 7 col 19=6 but sparse—unclear without expected, but pattern suggests underfilling some 1-clusters >=2, as in Train 2 where 1s vanished). Overall, it captures diagonal extension but likely mishandles conflicts/short segments, leaving potential unfilled >=2 1s (e.g., row 1 has two 1s far apart, not grouped/filled).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with background cells (likely 3 in the test case) and seed cells marked as 1 or 6, where the goal is to complete diagonal line segments (both backslash r-c constant and slash r+c constant) by filling in background cells along those diagonals if certain conditions are met, such as having at least two seeds on the same diagonal, while handling conflicts between 1s and 6s by prioritizing or fully extending 6s in overlapping cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Diagonals are strictly backslash (constant r - c) or slash (constant r + c); filling must stay within grid bounds and only overwrite background cells, not existing seeds or other colors.
 * For both 1s and 6s, segment filling triggers only if there are at least 2 seeds on the exact same diagonal line; isolated single seeds do not propagate.
 * Conflicts arise when a 6's diagonal overlaps with a 1's filled segment; in such cases, 6s may need full diagonal extension across the entire possible grid span for that diagonal, overriding background but respecting existing fills.
 * Background color (bg) is dynamically detected (e.g., grid[0][0]), and fills only target bg cells to avoid overwriting other content.
 * Order matters: process 1s first (both backslash and slash), then 6s, and finally handle 6 full fills based on conflicts with 1s' diagonals; this prevents 1s from blocking 6 extensions unintentionally.
 * Subtlety: Full fills for 6s in conflicts compute the entire possible row range for the diagonal (e.g., for slash, min_r = max(0, s - (ncols-1)), max_r = min(nrows-1, s)), ensuring complete lines even if seeds are sparse.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals can be short or partial; don't assume full grid span unless conflicting; also, multiple segments on the same diagonal type don't merge unless they share the exact diff/sum key.
 * Collect original seed positions before any filling to avoid modifying the list mid-process.
 * Grid is rectangular (nrows x ncols), and deep copy is essential to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential overfill: If a cell is filled by one diagonal but belongs to another's path, it won't be refilled if already non-bg, but conflicts might require re-evaluation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed all 5 training examples, indicating strong handling of basic segment filling for 1s and 6s on non-conflicting diagonals.
 * What worked: Grouping seeds by diagonal keys (diff for backslash, sum for slash) using defaultdict(list) correctly identifies segments with >=2 seeds, and the fill functions properly extend only bg cells within bounds.
 * What worked: Detecting bg dynamically and using deep copy prevents input mutation; processing 1s before 6s avoids premature blocking.
 * What didn't work: The full fill logic for conflicting 6s (extending entire diagonal if a 6's diff/sum overlaps a 1's filled diagonal) may overextend in cases where the conflict is local rather than global, potentially filling beyond intended segments (though this didn't fail training).
 * Subtle issue: Conflicting_diffs/sums are collected only from segments with >=2, but single 6s in conflict might not trigger full fill correctly if their exact position isn't checked against the set.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but if a function ignored single seeds entirely (e.g., no propagation for isolates), it would be broken— this attempt correctly leaves isolates unfilled.
 * Overall, core diagonal filling is demonstrated, but test case may reveal edge cases in conflict resolution or large grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 25x21 grid (25 rows of 21 integers each), mostly filled with 3 (likely bg), with scattered 1s and 6s forming partial diagonal patterns (e.g., visible short backslashes of 6s in rows 0-4, slashes of 1s in rows 5-10).
 * It makes partial sense as an extension of seeds: clusters like 6s on diff=constant in upper-left and 1s on slashes in mid-grid suggest segment filling worked, but some lines look incomplete (e.g., row 0 has isolated 6 at end, row 5 has a 1-6 mix that might indicate unresolved conflict).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected full diagonal extensions for conflicting 6s are missing in places (e.g., a 6 in row 6 col 2 should likely fill its entire backslash if conflicting with a 1 segment, but nearby cells remain 3); this differs from expected by leaving gaps in what should be solid lines, possibly due to the full fill only triggering per-orig_six rather than per-conflicting-diagonal.
 * Another difference: Some 1 segments (e.g., in row 18, positions suggesting a slash) are filled minimally but not extended to grid edges even if >=2 seeds, unlike training expectations where segments fully connect within their row range.
 * Overall, the output demonstrates understanding of basic filling but fails to produce clean, complete diagonals, indicating the conflict/full-fill logic needs refinement for larger/sparser test grids—it's different from expected complete patterns by having more isolated fills and unfilled bg in diagonal paths.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a diagonal-filling puzzle on a grid with a background color (detected from top-left cell, e.g., 3) and seed cells marked as 1 or 6. The goal is to fill entire segments (or full diagonals in conflict cases) along backslash (r - c constant) and slash (r + c constant) diagonals with the seed color if there are at least two seeds on that diagonal, overwriting only background or (in conflicts) opposing seeds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell value (e.g., 3); do not assume it's 0 or fixed—detect dynamically.
 * Seeds are only 1s and 6s; extract their positions first, then group by diagonal keys: backslash uses (r - c), slash uses (r + c).
 * Fill only segments with >=2 seeds: compute min_r and max_r from the seed rows in the group, and fill the contiguous diagonal segment between them, overwriting only background (not opposing seeds initially).
 * Process 1s first (both diagonal types), then 6s (both types), to prioritize 1 fills.
 * Conflicts arise when a 6 is on a diagonal that already has a filled 1-segment: for such 6s, perform a full perpendicular fill (e.g., if conflict on backslash, full-fill the slash diagonal passing through the 6, overwriting 1s).
 * Full fills for conflicts span the entire possible diagonal within grid bounds (e.g., for slash, min_r = max(0, s - (ncols-1)), max_r = min(nrows-1, s)).
 * Do not overwrite non-background/non-target cells during initial fills; only overwrite in conflict resolutions.
 * Grid is rectangular (nrows x ncols); handle edge cases like short diagonals or single seeds (no fill).
 * Subtlety: Grouping appends rows (r), not positions, since diagonals are row-sorted; ensure fill functions iterate r and compute c correctly.
 * No filling for isolated seeds (<2 on diagonal); preserve them as-is.
 * Deepcopy the grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Easy to miss: Conflict detection uses sets of keys from 1-groups with >=2; only check per-6 position's diagonals.
 * No other colors or rules (e.g., no horizontal/vertical fills, no counting lengths beyond >=2 threshold).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) successfully passed all 5 training examples, demonstrating correct implementation of seed extraction, diagonal grouping, segment filling for >=2 seeds, and conflict resolution via perpendicular full fills.
 * No prior attempts shown, but the core logic (prioritizing 1s, then 6s, handling overwrites only in conflicts) worked perfectly for training cases, including edge cases like short segments or multiple diagonals per color.
 * No misses in training: all outputs matched expected filled diagonals without extraneous overwrites.
 * Functions like detect_bg, extract_seeds, group_by_backslash/slash, fill_backslash/slash, fill_segments, and handle_conflicts are all essential and correct—reuse them as the foundation.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided utilities align with the puzzle (e.g., no irrelevant blob detection or horizontal fills).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 25x21 grid (inferred from 25 lines of 21 values each) with background 3s mostly preserved, and 1s/6s filled along diagonal segments and full lines where applicable.
 * It looks correct overall: visible diagonal runs of 1s (e.g., around row 2 col 2, row 3 col 3) and 6s (e.g., longer slash in rows 0-1 cols 8-9), with apparent conflict resolutions like full slash fills overwriting 1s (e.g., vertical-ish 6s in col 17 rows 12-21).
 * Specific observed effects: Many short 1-segments filled (e.g., 2-3 cells), longer 6-runs (4+ cells), and full edge-to-edge 6-diagonals (e.g., backslash in row 8 col 0 to row 12 col 4), which match rules for >=2 seeds and conflicts.
 * No obvious errors: No isolated seeds filled, no non-diagonal fills, overwrites seem targeted (e.g., 1s turned to 6s in conflict areas like row 17 col 9-10).
 * Subtle match: Background 3s remain unfilled where no seeds qualify; grid bounds respected (no out-of-bounds fills).
 * It aligns with expected output based on mentally simulating rules—e.g., a 6 at row 0 col 8 likely triggers a segment fill, and conflicts propagate perpendicularly without overfilling.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the interactions, connections, and effects that are consistent across **every** train example (1 through 5). These are based on obvious, repeatable patterns in positions, colors, and properties (e.g., bbox coordinates, holes, pixels) between inputs and outputs. I focused solely on elements that interact or affect each other, such as small shapes influencing paths or the background. Irrelevant elements (e.g., the uniform background color change mentioned in the query, which does not appear in the data) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., pink chain extensions, which occur in train 1, 2, and 4 but not 3 or 5) are not included. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained consistently (e.g., due to splits), it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Small Blue Shapes ↔ Small Blue Shapes (Path Connection via Position)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small blue shapes (color: blue, holes=0, pixels=1, bbox as single points).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: When two or more small blue shapes are present and at least one pair is aligned diagonally (i.e., the absolute difference in x-coordinates |Δx| equals the absolute difference in y-coordinates |Δy|, and |Δx| > 0), they interact by forming a connected diagonal chain in the output. Intermediate positions along the shortest diagonal path (stepping ±1 in x and ±1 in y each step, matching the sign of Δx and Δy) are filled with new small blue shapes (same properties: holes=0, pixels=1). This adds new blue shapes equal to the path length minus the input blues on that path (e.g., for |Δx|=|Δy|=n, adds n-1 blues if no interruptions). The path direction is determined by the positions (bbox coordinates) of the input blues.
     - Consistent in every train: Train 1 (|Δx|=|Δy|=6, adds 3 blues skipping pinks); Train 2 (|Δx|=|Δy|=5, adds 3 blues skipping 1 pink); Train 3 (|Δx|=|Δy|=6, adds 5 blues, no skips); Train 4 (one pair with |Δx|=|Δy|=9, adds 7 blues skipping 1 pink; other blues not aligned, so no path for them); Train 5 (|Δx|=|Δy|=5, adds 4 blues, no skips).
   - **Properties Affected**: Position (bbox) of input blues determines path start/end and thus new blue positions; no change to color, holes, or pixels of existing blues.
   - **No Interaction If**: No aligned pair (e.g., in train 4, two blues have no aligned partner, so they remain isolated without added blues connecting them).

#### 2. **Small Pink Shapes ↔ Small Blue Path Formation (Interruption via Position)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small pink shapes (color: pink, holes=0, pixels=1, bbox as single points) and the diagonal paths formed by blue shapes (as in #1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: If a small pink shape's position (bbox) lies exactly on the diagonal path between aligned input blue shapes, it interrupts the blue chain: no new blue shape is added at that position, but the pink remains unchanged, and the blue chain continues on adjacent positions. This maintains the overall connection between the blues without altering the pink or breaking the path logic.
     - Consistent in every train where applicable: Train 1 (2 pinks on path, skips add 3 blues instead of 5); Train 2 (1 pink on path, skips add 3 blues instead of 5); Train 3 (pink not on path, no interruption); Train 4 (1 pink on one blue path, skips add 7 blues instead of 8; no pinks on other potential paths); Train 5 (no pinks, no interruption).
   - **Properties Affected**: Position (bbox) of pink determines if/where it interrupts; no change to pink's color, holes, pixels, or position. Affects number of added blues (reduces by number of interrupting pinks).
   - **No Effect If**: Pink position not on a blue path (e.g., train 3 pink at [7,6], off the [7,1] to [1,7] path).

#### 3. **Input Small Shapes (Blue and Pink) ↔ Output Preservation (No Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: All input small shapes (blue or pink; holes=0, pixels=1, bbox as single points).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: All input small shapes (regardless of color) are preserved unchanged in the output: exact same position (bbox coordinates), color, holes=0, and pixels=1. No input small shape is removed, moved, resized, or recolored. This is a direct effect of their presence in the input affecting the output composition.
     - Consistent in every train: All input blues and pinks (e.g., train 1: 2 blues + 5 pinks preserved; train 3: 2 blues + 1 pink preserved; train 5: 2 blues preserved, no pinks).
   - **Properties Affected**: None (preservation means no transformation); their positions indirectly affect #1 and #2.

#### 4. **Added Small Shapes (Blue and Pink) ↔ Large Background Shape (Pixel and Hole Modification)**
   - **Components Involved**: New small shapes added in output (blue or pink; from #1 or preservation in #3; holes=0, pixels=1) and the large background shape (variable color like orange/maroon/yellow; holes ≥0, large bbox covering [0,0,W,H], large pixels >>1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Added small shapes (from blue paths or preservation) interact with the background by being "carved" into it: the background's total pixel count decreases by the number of added small shapes (each subtracts 1 pixel from background). The background color remains unchanged. In non-split cases, the background's hole count increases by exactly the number of added blue shapes (pinks do not affect holes).
     - Consistent in every train for pixel decrease: Train 1 (adds ~17 small, background total pixels 174 → 152, -22; approximate due to split); Train 2 (adds 10 small, 85 → 75, -10); Train 3 (adds 5 blues, 105 → 100, -5); Train 4 (adds ~20 small, 232 → 151 + 63 = 214, -18; approximate due to split); Train 5 (adds 4 blues, 79 → 75, -4).
     - Consistent in every non-split train for holes: Train 3 (adds 5 blues, holes 3 → 8, +5); Train 5 (adds 4 blues, 2 → 6, +4). (No added pinks affect holes in these.)
   - **Properties Affected**: Background pixels decrease (position of added smalls determines subtraction locations, but not explicitly mappable); background holes increase by added blues (in non-split cases). Background bbox may shrink or split (see unknown below).
   - **Unknown Transformation**: In split cases (train 1, 2, 4), background splits into 2–4 components (same color, smaller bboxes, some overlapping), total pixels still decrease but hole changes are inconsistent (e.g., train 2: holes 3 → 5 total, +2 despite +3 added blues; train 1: 6 → 5 total, -1). Condition for splitting unknown (e.g., occurs with multiple paths or pinks, but not when only blues and |Δx|=|Δy| small).

No other interactions are consistent across all examples (e.g., no consistent pink-to-pink paths, as they vary or absent; no color changes; no effects from shape silhouettes/edges beyond positions; no movement of existing shapes). Grid-like distribution is observed but not an interaction (just spatial pattern, no causal effect).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 17:09:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (detected as the top-left cell value, e.g., 3) and seed positions marked as 1 or 6, where the goal is to propagate and fill entire diagonals (both backslash r-c and slash r+c directions) with the corresponding color if multiple seeds (>=2) align on that diagonal, while handling priority conflicts where 6 takes precedence over 1 by overwriting.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is simple (top-left cell) but assumes uniform background; grids are rectangular, and fills only overwrite background or (in conflict cases) 1s, but not other 6s or existing fills unless specified.
 * Diagonals are grouped by key: backslash uses (r - c), slash uses (r + c); only groups with len(rs) >= 2 trigger fills, and fills cover the min_r to max_r segment of the diagonal, clipped to grid bounds.
 * Process order matters: Fill 1s on backslash, then slash (without overwriting each other or 6s); then fill 6s similarly; finally, for each 6 seed on a diagonal that had >=2 1s (conflicting keys tracked), perform a full perpendicular diagonal fill with 6, overwriting 1s (but not background-only areas).
 * Subtlety: Conflict handling only triggers for 6 positions individually if their diagonal key matches a 1-group key, and it fills the *full* extent of the perpendicular diagonal (e.g., for a backslash-conflicting 6, full slash; vice versa), not just segments—this can propagate 6 aggressively across the grid.
 * Fills do not overwrite existing same-color seeds or opposite colors except in explicit conflict overwrite_1=True cases; no merging of partial fills or handling of isolated single seeds.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; zero rows returns as-is; diagonal extents must be calculated precisely (e.g., for slash full fill, min_r = max(0, s - (ncols-1)), max_r = min(nrows-1, s)) to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * No rotation, reflection, or non-diagonal propagation; assumes integer grid values only 1,6, and bg.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping diagonals might leave artifacts if not all conflicts are caught; full conflict fills could overwrite non-conflicting 1s if perpendicular spans them; no post-processing for isolated 1s after overwrites.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; no prior iterations shown, but the core logic of diagonal grouping and segmented fills worked perfectly for all 5 training examples (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of basic propagation rules.
 * Conflict handling with full perpendicular fills and 1-overwriting seems to have succeeded in training cases without side effects.
 * No misses noted in training, but potential subtlety in full-fill bounds for conflicts (e.g., max_r calculations) could be untested edges.
 * All functions like extract_seeds, group_by_*, fill_* are essential and correct; deepcopy ensures input grid immutability.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions; the program structure (process 1s then 6s then conflicts) is relevant and avoids unnecessary complexity like blob detection or non-diagonal logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 25x21 grid (25 rows of 21 integers each) with background 3, scattered 1s and 6s forming diagonal patterns, e.g., visible backslash lines of 6s in rows 0-4 cols 8-12, slash lines of 1s in rows 5-10, and conflict-overwritten areas like row 6 col 2=6 overriding potential 1s.
 * It looks correct and makes sense: Fills align with expected diagonal propagations (e.g., multiple 6 seeds on r-c=-5 trigger backslash fill; 1s on r+c=10 trigger slash), and conflict areas show 6 dominance (e.g., full slash fills overwriting 1 segments in mid-grid). No obvious artifacts like unfilled >=2 groups or bound overflows; patterns are consistent with rules without isolated seeds propagating.
 * Expected output should match this if test input has similar seed alignments—mentally simulating (assuming input has sparse 1/6 on 3-bg), the fills extend logically (e.g., row 8 col 0=6 starts a backslash group), and conflicts (e.g., 6 at row 2 col 6 on a 1-backslash) trigger full perpendiculars without mismatches. It aligns with puzzle rules, so no updates needed yet.
