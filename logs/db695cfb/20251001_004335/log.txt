=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:43:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:57:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with colors representing background (likely 3, the most common), paths (color 1, forming diagonal lines in / and \ directions), and blockers (color 6, placed on or near paths). The goal is to complete incomplete diagonal paths by filling gaps with 1 where background exists, and then extend any blockers (6) on those paths perpendicularly (i.e., if a 6 is on a / path, extend it along the \ diagonal, and vice versa) by filling the entire perpendicular diagonal with 6 in background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 3), and only background cells can be filled/overwritten.
 * Paths (1) are strictly diagonal: group existing 1's by diagonal index (/ uses r - c, \ uses r + c), and if a group has 2+ points, fill all background cells along the continuous segment between min/max r in that diagonal.
 * Blockers (6) are extended only if they appear on a completed/extended path segment of 1's; extensions are full diagonals in the perpendicular direction (full / extends to full \, and vice versa), but only filling background cells—do not overwrite existing non-background.
 * Subtlety: Extensions happen after path filling, and only for paths with 6+ length? (code uses 6 as perp_color, but comment says "6 blockers on 1 paths"—this might mean extend if path has 6+ cells, or if 6 is the blocker; unclear, but code treats 6 as the color to detect/extend).
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals may not span the full grid; filling is only between min/max of existing points in a group, not the entire possible diagonal.
 * Perp extensions can chain or overlap, but code attempts to fill entire perp lines from detected 6 positions on paths—however, this risks overfilling if not conditioned properly.
 * Grid dimensions vary (test appears ~25x21 based on output row lengths); handle empty grids gracefully.
 * No overwriting of existing 1's or 6's; only background.
 * Potential for multiple passes? Code does one pass of fill then extend, but interactions might require iteration if extensions create new paths/blockers (though not evident in training).

                            grid[rr][cc] = perp_color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handled all 5 training examples (CORRECT), likely because training cases only required diagonal filling without needing perp extensions, or extensions weren't triggered due to the bug.
 * fill_diagonals function worked well for completing / and \ paths in training, correctly grouping by diagonal index and filling gaps only in background cells between min/max points.
 * extend_perp function is broken: it checks if path cells (1) equal perp_color (6), which is impossible, so no extensions occur— this didn't affect training but will fail cases needing blocker extensions.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or counts attempted, but not needed; puzzle is rule-based filling, not object detection.
 * Code uses deepcopy for safety, which is helpful to avoid mutating input.
 * No iteration between fill and extend; assumes one pass suffices, which worked for training but may miss interactions in complex cases.
 * No handling for multiple colors or non-1/6 paths; assumes 1=paths, 6=blockers fixed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 25x21 grid (based on row lengths of 21 elements each) with background 3 dominant, scattered 1's forming partial diagonals, and some 6's placed, but appears incomplete—many diagonals have gaps not filled (e.g., row 1 has isolated 6's and 1's without full segments), and no evident full perp extensions (e.g., no long \ lines of 6's crossing / paths of 1's).
 * Expected: After filling, paths of 1's should be continuous diagonals without background gaps; then, any 6 on those should extend to full perp diagonals of 6's (potentially creating barriers). Generated output has some filled 1's (e.g., row 2 has a 1 at col 10, row 3 at col 3) but looks patchy, with 6's not extended (e.g., row 1 col 9=6 is isolated, no full \ or / of 6's from it).
 * Does not make sense as correct: Lacks perp extensions entirely (due to bug), so if test input has 6's on paths needing extension, output misses them—e.g., visible 6's in rows 1-5 don't propagate perpendicularly, leaving potential paths unblocked. Gaps in 1's (e.g., row 6 has 1's at col 3 and 6, but not filled between if on diagonal) suggest partial but not full diagonal completion.
 * Specific differences: Output has more isolated 1's and 6's than expected continuous lines; e.g., a / diagonal around rows 2-4 cols 10-12 has 1's but surrounding backgrounds not filled, and nearby 6's (row 2 col 12) not extended to a full \ of 6's.
