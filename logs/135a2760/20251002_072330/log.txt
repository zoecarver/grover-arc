=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 07:23:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 07:33:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving row-based pattern completion, where each row has a background color (B), side indicators (often 2's marking boundaries), and a central range that should be filled with a repeating unit pattern consisting of groups of a main color (C) separated by background, based on the most common run length (K) observed in existing non-background, non-indicator cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B is always extracted from the first cell of the row (grid_row[0]), and it dominates as the separator in patterns.
 * Side indicators are at positions 1 and w-2; if both are 2, the pattern range shrinks to 2 to w-3 (avoiding outer sides), otherwise it's 1 to w-2— this handles cases where sides might be part of the pattern or strictly boundaries.
 * Main color C is the most frequent color in the pattern range excluding B and 2's; if none exists, skip the row.
 * Group size K is the mode (most frequent) length of consecutive runs of C in the range; in ties, pick the maximum K to favor longer groups, which seems to align with puzzle emphasis on prominent repeats.
 * The repeating unit is strictly [C] * K + [B], creating a period of K+1; no other colors or variations in the unit.
 * Phase selection maximizes matches to the existing row segment (not overwriting everything blindly, but aligning to preserve observed parts), using a simple cyclic shift and count of agreements.
 * Overwrite only the pattern range with the generated pattern; leave sides and background intact.
 * Subtlety: 2's are treated as placeholders or boundaries, ignored in frequency and runs— they don't count as C or B, so rows with many 2's might skip if no C is found.
 * Edge cases: If no runs of C, fallback K=1 (but rare); empty range skips row; all-B rows stay unchanged.
 * Puzzle assumes per-row independence—no column or global constraints mentioned.
 * Potential miss: If input has mixed colors beyond B/C/2, C selection might pick wrong if frequencies tie (though max freq handles it); phase might not perfectly fit if input is noisy or incomplete.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve existing matches to avoid over-destruction; handle variable widths; ties in mode favor max K for "strongest" pattern.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def get_background(grid_row: List[int]) -> int:
    """Extract the background color B from the first cell of the row."""
    return grid_row[0]
```

```python

        if val != B and val != 2:
            freq[val] += 1
    if not freq:
        return None

    if not runs:
        return 1  # Fallback, though shouldn't occur
    run_freq = collections.Counter(runs)
    max_f = run_freq.most_common(1)[0][1]
    possible_ks = [k for k, v in run_freq.items() if v == max_f]
    return max(possible_ks)
```

```python
def find_best_phase(grid_row: List[int], start: int, unit: List[int], period: int, num: int) -> int:
    """Find the phase with the maximum matches to the input row segment."""
    best_phase = 0

    for p in range(period):

            pat = unit[(j + p) % period]
            if pat == grid_row[start + j]:
                count += 1
        if count > best_count or (count == best_count and p < best_phase):
            best_count = count
            best_phase = p
    return best_phase
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid understanding of row-independent pattern completion with repeating units.
 * Worked: Background extraction, range determination based on sides, C selection via frequency (excluding 2's), K via mode runs with max tiebreaker, phase alignment to preserve matches, and targeted overwrite.
 * Didn't work: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes input has partial patterns; if input is fully blank or all 2's in range, it skips correctly, but might overfit if test has irregular runs.
 * The phase selection favors lowest phase in ties, which is a minor heuristic but helps consistency.
 * Run length calculation is precise (consecutive only), avoiding false groups.
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are targeted; nothing broken, but get_group_size fallback to 1 might be too arbitrary if no C runs (though C existence check precedes it).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output produces a highly repetitive grid with B=8, C=3 patterns: top/bottom rows all 8's (skipped as expected if no C), some rows with groups of six 3's separated by single 8's (e.g., row 2: repeating [3]*6 + [8]), and alternating single 3's separated by 8's in other rows (e.g., row 3: 8,3,8,3,... ending in 8).
 * It looks partially correct and makes sense for a puzzle emphasizing striped/repeating motifs, as it consistently applies the unit [3]*K + [8] with K=6 for grouped rows (likely from observed runs) and K=1 for alternating (single 3's as mode).
 * However, the output does not look fully correct: many rows (e.g., 4,6,7,8,10-12,14-16,18-20,22-24,26-27) end with two 8's (e.g., ...,3,8,8), suggesting the range end or phase alignment clips unevenly, which differs from expected symmetric patterns—possibly the input had 2's at sides causing shrunk range, but output overwrites without preserving potential boundary symmetry.
 * Repetition across rows (e.g., rows 4 and 6 identical) implies the program treats each row independently but might over-apply the same K/phase if input rows are similar; this could be wrong if test expects varied per-row C or K based on subtle input differences (unknown why, but output lacks diversity).
 * Bottom row mirrors row 2 but inverted in grouping, which seems intentional but might mismatch if puzzle rules require global consistency (e.g., no column alignment considered).
 * Overall, test output demonstrates pattern application but appears to homogenize too much—expected output likely has more variation or exact matches to partial input hints, not full overwrites; the all-8 rows are correct (no pattern to complete).

Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 07:54:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 29x29 based on the test input) that represents pixel art or a rendered image with numbers as pixel values (e.g., 8 as background, other digits as foreground elements like shapes or anomalies). The goal is to apply fixes to correct rendering errors, anomalies, or misplacements in objects (e.g., bays, nines, background shifts, and ones) while preserving the intended visual structure, but the program must handle varying grid sizes across inputs without index errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid dimensions vary: training examples likely have different sizes (e.g., fewer rows or columns), causing index out of range errors when accessing fixed positions like grid[24][3] or ranges up to 28; always validate bounds or use dynamic sizing based on len(grid) and len(grid[0]).
 * Anomalies include specific positional fixes: e.g., a "first bay" at row 24, column 3 needing value 2; "nines" where a 9 followed by 8 in columns 24-25 should swap to 9 in column 25; background shifts in specific rows (6,10,14,18,22,26) setting columns 16 and 19 to 8 and 4; "broken" background in rows 13 and 23 setting column 17 to 4.
 * "Ones" anomalies: in columns 9-12 of rows 2-26, consolidate scattered 1s to column 11, replacing others with 8 (background), but only if any 1 is present in those columns—subtle risk of over-replacing if conditions aren't precise.
 * Puzzle rules imply a structured image (e.g., repeating patterns in rows for shapes like bays or bars, with 3s/4s/9s forming objects); fixes should not alter valid foreground (e.g., don't touch 2s or 3s unintentionally) and must maintain symmetry or repetition seen in test input (e.g., alternating row patterns with 2s, 4s, 9s).
 * Subtle elements: Background is mostly 8s; anomalies might be rendering glitches in a larger scene (e.g., a ship bay or machinery); ensure fixes don't create new anomalies, like mismatched row lengths or overwriting non-anomalous pixels; consider row 0 and 28 as solid background borders.
 * No object extraction needed yet, but future fixes might require identifying "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-8 values) to avoid global changes; training errors suggest the puzzle tests robustness to input size variations.
 * All considerations: Preserve input grid by copying; apply fixes sequentially but idempotently (e.g., fix_nines checks conditions before changing); test input shows vertical repetition every 3 rows (e.g., patterns of 2s in columns 3-4, 1s in column 11, 4s/9s in columns 16-20 and 24-25), so fixes should enhance rather than disrupt this.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No custom types defined in attempt, but could be useful for representing anomalies
from typing import List, Tuple

class AnomalyFix:
    def __init__(self, row: int, col: int, new_value: int):
        self.row = row
        self.col = col
        self.new_value = new_value
```

# Helpful for safe access: prevents index errors in varying grid sizes
def safe_set(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, value: int) -> bool:
    if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):
        grid[r][c] = value
        return True
    return False

# From attempt: fix_nines is somewhat helpful for conditional swaps but assumes fixed columns 24-25
def fix_nines(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(1, rows - 1):  # Dynamic range to avoid out-of-bounds
        if cols > 25 and grid[r][24] == 9 and grid[r][25] == 8:
            grid[r][25] = 9
    return grid

# fix_ones is partially helpful for consolidating but over-applies replacements without full condition check
def fix_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(2, min(27, rows)):
        if cols > 12 and any(grid[r][c] == 1 for c in range(9, 13)):
            grid[r][11] = 1
            for c in [9, 10, 12]:
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    grid[r][c] = 8
    return grid
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) crashed on training examples 1 and 2 due to list index out of range, likely from hard-coded indices (e.g., grid[24][3], range(1,28), range(29)) assuming a fixed 29x29 grid, while training inputs are smaller—shows lack of dynamic sizing.
 * fix_first_bay is broken/unhelpful: hard-codes row 24, col 3 to 2, which fails on smaller grids; not general and assumes specific anomaly position without validation.
 * fix_nines worked conceptually for test (swapped some 8->9 in col 25 where needed) but assumes cols 24-25 exist; didn't crash test but irrelevant/unhelpful for training due to bounds.
 * fix_background_anomalies partially worked on test (set some 8s/4s in specified rows/cols) but hard-codes rows {6,10,14,18,22,26} and {13,23}, cols 16/17/19—causes errors on smaller grids; over-applies without checking if those rows exist, and "shifted/broken" logic seems arbitrary without puzzle context.
 * fix_ones applied consolidations in test (e.g., moved 1s to col 11, set others to 8) but condition is incomplete (sets col 11=1 even if already set, and replaces extras); didn't crash test but would on training; unhelpful as it assumes cols 9-12 and rows 2-26.
 * Overall, program copies grid correctly and sequences fixes, but no error handling—essential for puzzle with variable inputs; missed that fixes should be conditional on grid size and content to avoid side effects.
 * No object extraction function attempted, but it could be essential for identifying anomalies dynamically (e.g., find connected 1s or 9s) rather than position-based hacks.
 * Train 1 and 2: Complete failure due to bounds errors; expected clean execution and corrected grids, but got crashes—difference is total non-execution vs. partial fixes needed.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of anomaly types (bays, nines, background, ones) but ignores input variability.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: it preserved the overall structure (e.g., top/bottom 8 borders, repeating 3s in col 1, 2s in cols 3-4 for some rows, 1s consolidated to col 11, some 9s in cols 24-25, 4s in cols 16-20), and applied fixes like setting background to 8s in shifted rows and fixing some 4s in broken rows—looks like it's attempting to clean up a machinery or bay image.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: e.g., in rows like 4 and 7 (0-indexed), col 18-19 should likely remain 4s for object integrity but got partial overwrites to 8/4 inconsistently; 9s in cols 24-25 are fixed in some places (8->9) but not all (e.g., row 4 has 9,9 already, but fix_nines might redundantly touch); ones are over-consolidated (all scattered 1s forced to col 11=1, extras to 8, but original test has 1 only in col 11, so unnecessary changes could distort shapes); first bay fix at [24][3]=2 might have altered a valid 8 or 3.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should match a "clean" version of the input without anomalies (e.g., perfect symmetry in repeating rows, no stray 1s or shifted backgrounds), but generated has lingering inconsistencies (e.g., row 2 has 1 in col 11 unchanged, but nearby 4s/8s in cols 16-20 not fully aligned with patterns); it's different because fixes are position-specific hacks rather than rule-based (e.g., why rows 6/10/etc. specifically? Unknown if that's puzzle-derived or guessed).
 * Test ran without error (good), but output isn't perfect—missing holistic check for visual coherence (e.g., does the "bay" now render correctly?); account for test's vertical repetition (every 3 rows: type A with 2s and 8s, type B with 2s and 4s, type C with 8s and 4s) by making fixes pattern-aware to handle similar cases.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving row-based pattern completion, where each row has a background color (B), side indicators (often 2's marking boundaries), and a central range that should be filled with a repeating unit pattern consisting of groups of a main color (C) separated by background, based on the most common run length (K) observed in existing non-background, non-indicator cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B is always extracted from the first cell of the row (grid_row[0]), and it dominates as the separator in patterns.
 * Side indicators are at positions 1 and w-2; if both are 2, the pattern range shrinks to 2 to w-3 (avoiding outer sides), otherwise it's 1 to w-2— this handles cases where sides might be part of the pattern or strictly boundaries.
 * Main color C is the most frequent color in the pattern range excluding B and 2's; if none exists, skip the row.
 * Group size K is the mode (most frequent) length of consecutive runs of C in the range; in ties, pick the maximum K to favor longer groups, which seems to align with puzzle emphasis on prominent repeats.
 * The repeating unit is strictly [C] * K + [B], creating a period of K+1; no other colors or variations in the unit.
 * Phase selection maximizes matches to the existing row segment (not overwriting everything blindly, but aligning to preserve observed parts), using a simple cyclic shift and count of agreements.
 * Overwrite only the pattern range with the generated pattern; leave sides and background intact.
 * Subtlety: 2's are treated as placeholders or boundaries, ignored in frequency and runs— they don't count as C or B, so rows with many 2's might skip if no C is found.
 * Edge cases: If no runs of C, fallback K=1 (but rare); empty range skips row; all-B rows stay unchanged.
 * Puzzle assumes per-row independence—no column or global constraints mentioned.
 * Potential miss: If input has mixed colors beyond B/C/2, C selection might pick wrong if frequencies tie (though max freq handles it); phase might not perfectly fit if input is noisy or incomplete.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve existing matches to avoid over-destruction; handle variable widths; ties in mode favor max K for "strongest" pattern.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid understanding of row-independent pattern completion with repeating units.
 * Worked: Background extraction, range determination based on sides, C selection via frequency (excluding 2's), K via mode runs with max tiebreaker, phase alignment to preserve matches, and targeted overwrite.
 * Didn't work: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes input has partial patterns; if input is fully blank or all 2's in range, it skips correctly, but might overfit if test has irregular runs.
 * The phase selection favors lowest phase in ties, which is a minor heuristic but helps consistency.
 * Run length calculation is precise (consecutive only), avoiding false groups.
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are targeted; nothing broken, but get_group_size fallback to 1 might be too arbitrary if no C runs (though C existence check precedes it).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output produces a highly repetitive grid with B=8, C=3 patterns: top/bottom rows all 8's (skipped as expected if no C), some rows with groups of six 3's separated by single 8's (e.g., row 2: repeating [3]*6 + [8]), and alternating single 3's separated by 8's in other rows (e.g., row 3: 8,3,8,3,... ending in 8).
 * It looks partially correct and makes sense for a puzzle emphasizing striped/repeating motifs, as it consistently applies the unit [3]*K + [8] with K=6 for grouped rows (likely from observed runs) and K=1 for alternating (single 3's as mode).
 * However, the output does not look fully correct: many rows (e.g., 4,6,7,8,10-12,14-16,18-20,22-24,26-27) end with two 8's (e.g., ...,3,8,8), suggesting the range end or phase alignment clips unevenly, which differs from expected symmetric patterns—possibly the input had 2's at sides causing shrunk range, but output overwrites without preserving potential boundary symmetry.
 * Repetition across rows (e.g., rows 4 and 6 identical) implies the program treats each row independently but might over-apply the same K/phase if input rows are similar; this could be wrong if test expects varied per-row C or K based on subtle input differences (unknown why, but output lacks diversity).
 * Bottom row mirrors row 2 but inverted in grouping, which seems intentional but might mismatch if puzzle rules require global consistency (e.g., no column alignment considered).
 * Overall, test output demonstrates pattern application but appears to homogenize too much—expected output likely has more variation or exact matches to partial input hints, not full overwrites; the all-8 rows are correct (no pattern to complete).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:05:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a structured image like a building, ship, or architectural diagram) where numbers symbolize elements such as walls (8), windows or panels (3), decks or floors (4), bays or openings (2), lights or accents (1), and other details (9). The goal is to complete repeating patterns in rows based on side indicators (e.g., 2 for open patterns), consolidate or fill specific elements in designated columns/rows, and ensure symmetry or consistency across the grid while treating 8 as a neutral background or wall that can be overwritten or preserved.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are processed individually for pattern completion only if the second (index 1) and second-last (index -2) cells are both 2, indicating "open" sides for patterning; otherwise, the pattern range shifts inward (1 to width-2 vs. 2 to width-3) to respect borders.
 * Patterns are repeating units of K consecutive instances of the main color C (most frequent non-border non-2 value in the range), followed by a single border color B (from row[0]); K is the mode run length of C, with ties broken by maximum K—subtlety: if no runs, fallback to K=1, which could overfill sparse areas.
 * Best phase alignment maximizes matches to existing cells before overwriting, preserving partial patterns but potentially forcing uniform repeats that ignore vertical consistency or global structure.
 * Fixes are conditional (e.g., only if top-left is 8, suggesting a "walled" grid type) and target specific rows (2-26 for most, 1-27 for bays): consolidate 1s to column 11 (and set others to 8) if any in 9-12; move 9s from 24 to 25 (setting 24 to 8); fill 16-19 with 4s if not already; consolidate 2s to columns 3-4 (setting others in 2-5 to 8) if any in 2-5—subtlety: these assume fixed column indices, ignoring grid width variations, and overwrite to 8, which could erase intended details if misapplied.
 * Global considerations: Grid is copied to avoid mutating input; width assumed consistent (29 columns in test); patterns assume horizontal repetition only, no vertical propagation; 8 acts as erasable filler but is used as separator in units; potential for overfilling if input has noise (e.g., stray 3s leading to C=3 everywhere); symmetry not enforced, but test output shows near-mirroring on sides; rows 0 and 28 are untouched (all 8s, likely top/bottom borders).
 * Easy-to-miss: Border B from row[0] may vary per row, allowing row-specific colors; no handling for empty ranges or all-2/ all-B rows; fixes don't check for conflicts (e.g., filling 4s over a pattern); no extraction of "objects" like full structures, just row-wise ops—could miss holistic elements like connected components.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary submission): No prior versions shown, but code includes fallbacks (e.g., None for C returns early) that prevent crashes but may leave rows incomplete.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
import collections

def get_pattern_range(left: int, right: int, width: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Determine the start and end indices for pattern cells based on side values."""
    if left == 2 and right == 2:
        return 2, width - 3
    return 1, width - 2
```
(This is helpful for conditional range adjustment based on side indicators.)

```python
def get_main_color(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, B: int) -> Optional[int]:
    """Find the main color C: most frequent non-B, non-2 color in the range."""
    freq = collections.Counter()
    for c in range(start, end + 1):
        val = row[c]
        if val != B and val != 2:
            freq[val] += 1
    if not freq:
        return None
    return max(freq, key=freq.get)
```
(This is core for identifying dominant pattern color C, excluding borders and specials.)

```python
def get_group_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, C: int) -> int:
    """Compute the mode group size K for consecutive runs of C in the range. In case of tie, choose the maximum K."""
    runs = []
    i = start
    while i <= end:
        if row[i] == C:
            length = 0
            while i <= end and row[i] == C:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            runs.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    if not runs:
        return 1  # Fallback, though shouldn't occur
    run_freq = collections.Counter(runs)
    max_f = run_freq.most_common(1)[0][1]
    possible_ks = [k for k, v in run_freq.items() if v == max_f]
    return max(possible_ks)
```
(This accurately computes run-length mode for pattern grouping, with tiebreaker—essential for unit construction.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], start: int, unit: List[int], period: int, num: int) -> int:
    """Find the phase with the maximum matches to the input row segment."""
    best_phase = 0
    best_count = -1
    for p in range(period):
        count = 0
        for j in range(num):
            pat = unit[(j + p) % period]
            if pat == row[start + j]:
                count += 1
        if count > best_count or (count == best_count and p < best_phase):
            best_count = count
            best_phase = p
    return best_phase
```
(This aligns the repeating unit to existing data, preserving matches—key for natural completion.)

(The fix functions like fix_ones, fix_nines, fix_fours, fix_bays are helpful for targeted consolidations but are column-specific and may need generalization for variable widths.)

(No object extraction functions present; could add one to identify connected components of colors like 3s for "windows" to enforce vertical alignment, e.g.:)
```python
def extract_windows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (row_start, col, height)
    """Extract connected vertical runs of 3s as window objects."""
    windows = []
    # Implementation to scan columns for vertical 3-runs, ignoring 8s/others
    return windows
```
(This would be helpful for future attempts to handle vertical patterns, which current code misses.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; no earlier versions detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 fully (correct outputs), demonstrating understanding of row-wise pattern repetition and fixes.
 * Worked well: Pattern completion via unit repetition and phase alignment correctly fills open-sided rows with consistent groups (e.g., [3]*K + [8]); fixes properly consolidate specials (1s to col 11, 2s to 3-4, etc.) without side effects in training.
 * Did not work/partial: No vertical consistency enforced, so horizontal fills may misalign columns (e.g., 3s not stacking into full windows); assumes B=row[0] uniform, but if borders vary, patterns could clash; fallback K=1 may create unwanted singles in sparse rows; no handling for non-8 backgrounds or grids without top-left 8 (skips fixes).
 * Subtle misses: Overwriting ignores potential pre-existing vertical objects (e.g., multi-row 4s or 3s); column-hardcoded fixes (e.g., 9-12 for 1s) fail if width <25+; no symmetry check, leading to asymmetric fills if input is noisy.
 * Function complete_single_row is core and helpful; get_pattern_range handles side conditions well.
 * Functions like fix_ones/fix_nines are helpful but narrow—broken if columns exceed grid width (no bounds check beyond continue); not general for other specials.
 * No unhelpful functions; all are relevant, but pattern logic assumes C !=2/B, missing cases where 2 is part of pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output produces a highly repetitive grid: rows 0/28 all 8s (untouched borders); row 1/27 have groups of six 3s separated by single 8s (suggesting K=6 for C=3, B=8, full repeat across open range); rows 2-26 alternate between two patterns—type A (e.g., row 2: starts 8,3,8,3,... up to col 15=3, then 4x4s in 16-19, then 8,3,8,3,... ending 8, implying K=1 singles) and type B (e.g., row 3: starts 8,8,3,8,... then 4s, then 3,8,3,... ending 8,8, shifted phase or range).
 * Effects observed: fix_fours applied uniformly (4s in cols 16-19 for rows 2-26, overwriting any non-4); no 1s/9s/2s visible (suggesting consolidation to 8 or positions, or absent in input); left/right sides near-mirror but with phase shifts (e.g., type A has 16 singles of 3 before 4s, type B has 15 with double-8 starts/ends); overall creates a "faceted" wall with window slits (single 3s) and a central deck block (4s), bookended by denser window rows.
 * Does not look fully correct: Repetition is too rigid—alternating row types suggest inconsistent side values (some rows have row[1]=3 or 8, shifting range/phase), but if input had uniform 2-sides, all rows should match (over-application?); right side post-4s has 8,3 repeats but shorter (8 cells vs. left's 16), breaking symmetry (expected mirror for building-like puzzle); no vertical stacking (e.g., 3s don't align into columns of windows, just horizontal scratches); groups of six 3s in rows 1/27 fit a header/footer, but singles elsewhere imply wrong K detection (mode tie or sparse input leading to max K=1 fallback?); without input grid, can't confirm, but output feels "noisy" not structured—likely misses vertical rules or object-based filling (e.g., bays as 2s should stack, but fixed to 8s/3s).
 * Differences from expected: Expected a more coherent structure (e.g., uniform window columns of 3s across rows, symmetric bays at cols 3-4 with 2s preserved/filled vertically, 4s only where intended not blanket); generated has fragmented 3s (singles vs. groups), no visible 2s/1s/9s (over-erased?), and repetitive but misaligned rows—probably incorrect phase/K or missing global alignment; subtle: if input had partial patterns, phase matching worked locally but created vertical mismatches (e.g., col 2: 3 in row2, 8 in row3).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:05:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 29x29 based on the test input) that represents pixel art or a rendered image with numbers as pixel values (e.g., 8 as background, other digits as foreground elements like shapes or anomalies). The goal is to apply fixes to correct rendering errors, anomalies, or misplacements in objects (e.g., bays, nines, background shifts, and ones) while preserving the intended visual structure, but the program must handle varying grid sizes across inputs without index errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid dimensions vary: training examples likely have different sizes (e.g., fewer rows or columns), causing index out of range errors when accessing fixed positions like grid[24][3] or ranges up to 28; always validate bounds or use dynamic sizing based on len(grid) and len(grid[0]).
 * Anomalies include specific positional fixes: e.g., a "first bay" at row 24, column 3 needing value 2; "nines" where a 9 followed by 8 in columns 24-25 should swap to 9 in column 25; background shifts in specific rows (6,10,14,18,22,26) setting columns 16 and 19 to 8 and 4; "broken" background in rows 13 and 23 setting column 17 to 4.
 * "Ones" anomalies: in columns 9-12 of rows 2-26, consolidate scattered 1s to column 11, replacing others with 8 (background), but only if any 1 is present in those columns—subtle risk of over-replacing if conditions aren't precise.
 * Puzzle rules imply a structured image (e.g., repeating patterns in rows for shapes like bays or bars, with 3s/4s/9s forming objects); fixes should not alter valid foreground (e.g., don't touch 2s or 3s unintentionally) and must maintain symmetry or repetition seen in test input (e.g., alternating row patterns with 2s, 4s, 9s).
 * Subtle elements: Background is mostly 8s; anomalies might be rendering glitches in a larger scene (e.g., a ship bay or machinery); ensure fixes don't create new anomalies, like mismatched row lengths or overwriting non-anomalous pixels; consider row 0 and 28 as solid background borders.
 * No object extraction needed yet, but future fixes might require identifying "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-8 values) to avoid global changes; training errors suggest the puzzle tests robustness to input size variations.
 * All considerations: Preserve input grid by copying; apply fixes sequentially but idempotently (e.g., fix_nines checks conditions before changing); test input shows vertical repetition every 3 rows (e.g., patterns of 2s in columns 3-4, 1s in column 11, 4s/9s in columns 16-20 and 24-25), so fixes should enhance rather than disrupt this.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No custom types defined in attempt, but could be useful for representing anomalies
from typing import List, Tuple

class AnomalyFix:
    def __init__(self, row: int, col: int, new_value: int):
        self.row = row
        self.col = col
        self.new_value = new_value
```

```python
# Helpful for safe access: prevents index errors in varying grid sizes
def safe_set(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, value: int) -> bool:
    if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):
        grid[r][c] = value
        return True
    return False

# From attempt: fix_nines is somewhat helpful for conditional swaps but assumes fixed columns 24-25
def fix_nines(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(1, rows - 1):  # Dynamic range to avoid out-of-bounds
        if cols > 25 and grid[r][24] == 9 and grid[r][25] == 8:
            grid[r][25] = 9
    return grid

# fix_ones is partially helpful for consolidating but over-applies replacements without full condition check
def fix_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(2, min(27, rows)):
        if cols > 12 and any(grid[r][c] == 1 for c in range(9, 13)):
            grid[r][11] = 1
            for c in [9, 10, 12]:
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    grid[r][c] = 8
    return grid
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) crashed on training examples 1 and 2 due to list index out of range, likely from hard-coded indices (e.g., grid[24][3], range(1,28), range(29)) assuming a fixed 29x29 grid, while training inputs are smaller—shows lack of dynamic sizing.
 * fix_first_bay is broken/unhelpful: hard-codes row 24, col 3 to 2, which fails on smaller grids; not general and assumes specific anomaly position without validation.
 * fix_nines worked conceptually for test (swapped some 8->9 in col 25 where needed) but assumes cols 24-25 exist; didn't crash test but irrelevant/unhelpful for training due to bounds.
 * fix_background_anomalies partially worked on test (set some 8s/4s in specified rows/cols) but hard-codes rows {6,10,14,18,22,26} and {13,23}, cols 16/17/19—causes errors on smaller grids; over-applies without checking if those rows exist, and "shifted/broken" logic seems arbitrary without puzzle context.
 * fix_ones applied consolidations in test (e.g., moved 1s to col 11, set others to 8) but condition is incomplete (sets col 11=1 even if already set, and replaces extras); didn't crash test but would on training; unhelpful as it assumes cols 9-12 and rows 2-26.
 * Overall, program copies grid correctly and sequences fixes, but no error handling—essential for puzzle with variable inputs; missed that fixes should be conditional on grid size and content to avoid side effects.
 * No object extraction function attempted, but it could be essential for identifying anomalies dynamically (e.g., find connected 1s or 9s) rather than position-based hacks.
 * Train 1 and 2: Complete failure due to bounds errors; expected clean execution and corrected grids, but got crashes—difference is total non-execution vs. partial fixes needed.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of anomaly types (bays, nines, background, ones) but ignores input variability.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: it preserved the overall structure (e.g., top/bottom 8 borders, repeating 3s in col 1, 2s in cols 3-4 for some rows, 1s consolidated to col 11, some 9s in cols 24-25, 4s in cols 16-20), and applied fixes like setting background to 8s in shifted rows and fixing some 4s in broken rows—looks like it's attempting to clean up a machinery or bay image.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: e.g., in rows like 4 and 7 (0-indexed), col 18-19 should likely remain 4s for object integrity but got partial overwrites to 8/4 inconsistently; 9s in cols 24-25 are fixed in some places (8->9) but not all (e.g., row 4 has 9,9 already, but fix_nines might redundantly touch); ones are over-consolidated (all scattered 1s forced to col 11=1, extras to 8, but original test has 1 only in col 11, so unnecessary changes could distort shapes); first bay fix at [24][3]=2 might have altered a valid 8 or 3.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should match a "clean" version of the input without anomalies (e.g., perfect symmetry in repeating rows, no stray 1s or shifted backgrounds), but generated has lingering inconsistencies (e.g., row 2 has 1 in col 11 unchanged, but nearby 4s/8s in cols 16-20 not fully aligned with patterns); it's different because fixes are position-specific hacks rather than rule-based (e.g., why rows 6/10/etc. specifically? Unknown if that's puzzle-derived or guessed).
 * Test ran without error (good), but output isn't perfect—missing holistic check for visual coherence (e.g., does the "bay" now render correctly?); account for test's vertical repetition (every 3 rows: type A with 2s and 8s, type B with 2s and 4s, type C with 8s and 4s) by making fixes pattern-aware to handle similar cases.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving row-based pattern completion, where each row has a background color (B), side indicators (often 2's marking boundaries), and a central range that should be filled with a repeating unit pattern consisting of groups of a main color (C) separated by background, based on the most common run length (K) observed in existing non-background, non-indicator cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B is always extracted from the first cell of the row (grid_row[0]), and it dominates as the separator in patterns.
 * Side indicators are at positions 1 and w-2; if both are 2, the pattern range shrinks to 2 to w-3 (avoiding outer sides), otherwise it's 1 to w-2— this handles cases where sides might be part of the pattern or strictly boundaries.
 * Main color C is the most frequent color in the pattern range excluding B and 2's; if none exists, skip the row.
 * Group size K is the mode (most frequent) length of consecutive runs of C in the range; in ties, pick the maximum K to favor longer groups, which seems to align with puzzle emphasis on prominent repeats.
 * The repeating unit is strictly [C] * K + [B], creating a period of K+1; no other colors or variations in the unit.
 * Phase selection maximizes matches to the existing row segment (not overwriting everything blindly, but aligning to preserve observed parts), using a simple cyclic shift and count of agreements.
 * Overwrite only the pattern range with the generated pattern; leave sides and background intact.
 * Subtlety: 2's are treated as placeholders or boundaries, ignored in frequency and runs— they don't count as C or B, so rows with many 2's might skip if no C is found.
 * Edge cases: If no runs of C, fallback K=1 (but rare); empty range skips row; all-B rows stay unchanged.
 * Puzzle assumes per-row independence—no column or global constraints mentioned.
 * Potential miss: If input has mixed colors beyond B/C/2, C selection might pick wrong if frequencies tie (though max freq handles it); phase might not perfectly fit if input is noisy or incomplete.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve existing matches to avoid over-destruction; handle variable widths; ties in mode favor max K for "strongest" pattern.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid understanding of row-independent pattern completion with repeating units.
 * Worked: Background extraction, range determination based on sides, C selection via frequency (excluding 2's), K via mode runs with max tiebreaker, phase alignment to preserve matches, and targeted overwrite.
 * Didn't work: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes input has partial patterns; if input is fully blank or all 2's in range, it skips correctly, but might overfit if test has irregular runs.
 * The phase selection favors lowest phase in ties, which is a minor heuristic but helps consistency.
 * Run length calculation is precise (consecutive only), avoiding false groups.
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are targeted; nothing broken, but get_group_size fallback to 1 might be too arbitrary if no C runs (though C existence check precedes it).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output produces a highly repetitive grid with B=8, C=3 patterns: top/bottom rows all 8's (skipped as expected if no C), some rows with groups of six 3's separated by single 8's (e.g., row 2: repeating [3]*6 + [8]), and alternating single 3's separated by 8's in other rows (e.g., row 3: 8,3,8,3,... ending in 8).
 * It looks partially correct and makes sense for a puzzle emphasizing striped/repeating motifs, as it consistently applies the unit [3]*K + [8] with K=6 for grouped rows (likely from observed runs) and K=1 for alternating (single 3's as mode).
 * However, the output does not look fully correct: many rows (e.g., 4,6,7,8,10-12,14-16,18-20,22-24,26-27) end with two 8's (e.g., ...,3,8,8), suggesting the range end or phase alignment clips unevenly, which differs from expected symmetric patterns—possibly the input had 2's at sides causing shrunk range, but output overwrites without preserving potential boundary symmetry.
 * Repetition across rows (e.g., rows 4 and 6 identical) implies the program treats each row independently but might over-apply the same K/phase if input rows are similar; this could be wrong if test expects varied per-row C or K based on subtle input differences (unknown why, but output lacks diversity).
 * Bottom row mirrors row 2 but inverted in grouping, which seems intentional but might mismatch if puzzle rules require global consistency (e.g., no column alignment considered).
 * Overall, test output demonstrates pattern application but appears to homogenize too much—expected output likely has more variation or exact matches to partial input hints, not full overwrites; the all-8 rows are correct (no pattern to complete).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a structured image like a building, ship, or architectural diagram) where numbers symbolize elements such as walls (8), windows or panels (3), decks or floors (4), bays or openings (2), lights or accents (1), and other details (9). The goal is to complete repeating patterns in rows based on side indicators (e.g., 2 for open patterns), consolidate or fill specific elements in designated columns/rows, and ensure symmetry or consistency across the grid while treating 8 as a neutral background or wall that can be overwritten or preserved.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are processed individually for pattern completion only if the second (index 1) and second-last (index -2) cells are both 2, indicating "open" sides for patterning; otherwise, the pattern range shifts inward (1 to width-2 vs. 2 to width-3) to respect borders.
 * Patterns are repeating units of K consecutive instances of the main color C (most frequent non-border non-2 value in the range), followed by a single border color B (from row[0]); K is the mode run length of C, with ties broken by maximum K—subtlety: if no runs, fallback to K=1, which could overfill sparse areas.
 * Best phase alignment maximizes matches to existing cells before overwriting, preserving partial patterns but potentially forcing uniform repeats that ignore vertical consistency or global structure.
 * Fixes are conditional (e.g., only if top-left is 8, suggesting a "walled" grid type) and target specific rows (2-26 for most, 1-27 for bays): consolidate 1s to column 11 (and set others to 8) if any in 9-12; move 9s from 24 to 25 (setting 24 to 8); fill 16-19 with 4s if not already; consolidate 2s to columns 3-4 (setting others in 2-5 to 8) if any in 2-5—subtlety: these assume fixed column indices, ignoring grid width variations, and overwrite to 8, which could erase intended details if misapplied.
 * Global considerations: Grid is copied to avoid mutating input; width assumed consistent (29 columns in test); patterns assume horizontal repetition only, no vertical propagation; 8 acts as erasable filler but is used as separator in units; potential for overfilling if input has noise (e.g., stray 3s leading to C=3 everywhere); symmetry not enforced, but test output shows near-mirroring on sides; rows 0 and 28 are untouched (all 8s, likely top/bottom borders).
 * Easy-to-miss: Border B from row[0] may vary per row, allowing row-specific colors; no handling for empty ranges or all-2/ all-B rows; fixes don't check for conflicts (e.g., filling 4s over a pattern); no extraction of "objects" like full structures, just row-wise ops—could miss holistic elements like connected components.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary submission): No prior versions shown, but code includes fallbacks (e.g., None for C returns early) that prevent crashes but may leave rows incomplete.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
import collections

def get_pattern_range(left: int, right: int, width: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Determine the start and end indices for pattern cells based on side values."""
    if left == 2 and right == 2:
        return 2, width - 3
    return 1, width - 2
```
(This is helpful for conditional range adjustment based on side indicators.)

```python
def get_main_color(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, B: int) -> Optional[int]:
    """Find the main color C: most frequent non-B, non-2 color in the range."""
    freq = collections.Counter()
    for c in range(start, end + 1):
        val = row[c]
        if val != B and val != 2:
            freq[val] += 1
    if not freq:
        return None
    return max(freq, key=freq.get)
```
(This is core for identifying dominant pattern color C, excluding borders and specials.)

```python
def get_group_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, C: int) -> int:
    """Compute the mode group size K for consecutive runs of C in the range. In case of tie, choose the maximum K."""
    runs = []
    i = start
    while i <= end:
        if row[i] == C:
            length = 0
            while i <= end and row[i] == C:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            runs.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    if not runs:
        return 1  # Fallback, though shouldn't occur
    run_freq = collections.Counter(runs)
    max_f = run_freq.most_common(1)[0][1]
    possible_ks = [k for k, v in run_freq.items() if v == max_f]
    return max(possible_ks)
```
(This accurately computes run-length mode for pattern grouping, with tiebreaker—essential for unit construction.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], start: int, unit: List[int], period: int, num: int) -> int:
    """Find the phase with the maximum matches to the input row segment."""
    best_phase = 0
    best_count = -1
    for p in range(period):
        count = 0
        for j in range(num):
            pat = unit[(j + p) % period]
            if pat == row[start + j]:
                count += 1
        if count > best_count or (count == best_count and p < best_phase):
            best_count = count
            best_phase = p
    return best_phase
```
(This aligns the repeating unit to existing data, preserving matches—key for natural completion.)

(The fix functions like fix_ones, fix_nines, fix_fours, fix_bays are helpful for targeted consolidations but are column-specific and may need generalization for variable widths.)

(No object extraction functions present; could add one to identify connected components of colors like 3s for "windows" to enforce vertical alignment, e.g.:)
```python
def extract_windows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (row_start, col, height)
    """Extract connected vertical runs of 3s as window objects."""
    windows = []
    # Implementation to scan columns for vertical 3-runs, ignoring 8s/others
    return windows
```
(This would be helpful for future attempts to handle vertical patterns, which current code misses.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; no earlier versions detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 fully (correct outputs), demonstrating understanding of row-wise pattern repetition and fixes.
 * Worked well: Pattern completion via unit repetition and phase alignment correctly fills open-sided rows with consistent groups (e.g., [3]*K + [8]); fixes properly consolidate specials (1s to col 11, 2s to 3-4, etc.) without side effects in training.
 * Did not work/partial: No vertical consistency enforced, so horizontal fills may misalign columns (e.g., 3s not stacking into full windows); assumes B=row[0] uniform, but if borders vary, patterns could clash; fallback K=1 may create unwanted singles in sparse rows; no handling for non-8 backgrounds or grids without top-left 8 (skips fixes).
 * Subtle misses: Overwriting ignores potential pre-existing vertical objects (e.g., multi-row 4s or 3s); column-hardcoded fixes (e.g., 9-12 for 1s) fail if width <25+; no symmetry check, leading to asymmetric fills if input is noisy.
 * Function complete_single_row is core and helpful; get_pattern_range handles side conditions well.
 * Functions like fix_ones/fix_nines are helpful but narrow—broken if columns exceed grid width (no bounds check beyond continue); not general for other specials.
 * No unhelpful functions; all are relevant, but pattern logic assumes C !=2/B, missing cases where 2 is part of pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output produces a highly repetitive grid: rows 0/28 all 8s (untouched borders); row 1/27 have groups of six 3s separated by single 8s (suggesting K=6 for C=3, B=8, full repeat across open range); rows 2-26 alternate between two patterns—type A (e.g., row 2: starts 8,3,8,3,... up to col 15=3, then 4x4s in 16-19, then 8,3,8,3,... ending 8, implying K=1 singles) and type B (e.g., row 3: starts 8,8,3,8,... then 4s, then 3,8,3,... ending 8,8, shifted phase or range).
 * Effects observed: fix_fours applied uniformly (4s in cols 16-19 for rows 2-26, overwriting any non-4); no 1s/9s/2s visible (suggesting consolidation to 8 or positions, or absent in input); left/right sides near-mirror but with phase shifts (e.g., type A has 16 singles of 3 before 4s, type B has 15 with double-8 starts/ends); overall creates a "faceted" wall with window slits (single 3s) and a central deck block (4s), bookended by denser window rows.
 * Does not look fully correct: Repetition is too rigid—alternating row types suggest inconsistent side values (some rows have row[1]=3 or 8, shifting range/phase), but if input had uniform 2-sides, all rows should match (over-application?); right side post-4s has 8,3 repeats but shorter (8 cells vs. left's 16), breaking symmetry (expected mirror for building-like puzzle); no vertical stacking (e.g., 3s don't align into columns of windows, just horizontal scratches); groups of six 3s in rows 1/27 fit a header/footer, but singles elsewhere imply wrong K detection (mode tie or sparse input leading to max K=1 fallback?); without input grid, can't confirm, but output feels "noisy" not structured—likely misses vertical rules or object-based filling (e.g., bays as 2s should stack, but fixed to 8s/3s).
 * Differences from expected: Expected a more coherent structure (e.g., uniform window columns of 3s across rows, symmetric bays at cols 3-4 with 2s preserved/filled vertically, 4s only where intended not blanket); generated has fragmented 3s (singles vs. groups), no visible 2s/1s/9s (over-erased?), and repetitive but misaligned rows—probably incorrect phase/K or missing global alignment; subtle: if input had partial patterns, phase matching worked locally but created vertical mismatches (e.g., col 2: 3 in row2, 8 in row3).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 08:18:55] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves completing and correcting a grid representing a visual pattern, likely a pixel-art style image such as a landscape or architectural scene, where a background color (B, often 8) is filled in, and foreground elements like repeating structures (e.g., walls or patterns with 3's), bays (2's), windows (1's), solid blocks (4's), and edge details (9's) are detected and enforced across rows to match an expected symmetric or periodic design. The goal is to apply rule-based fixes and pattern completions to transform an incomplete or noisy input grid into a clean, consistent output that adheres to implicit structural rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B (e.g., 8) dominates borders and separators; never overwrite confirmed B positions unless part of a specific fix like bays or nines.
 * Rows often follow periodic patterns, such as repeating units of K instances of a color C followed by B (e.g., [3]*6 + [8]); detect the most frequent run length K for the dominant non-B color in the middle section, excluding sides and low-frequency colors like 2.
 * Side elements (positions 1 and w-2) may indicate asymmetric patterns; if they match and differ from B, treat one side as a pattern guide but exclude it from frequency counts to avoid skewing.
 * Thresholds are critical: only apply pattern completion if the dominant color appears in at least 25% of the middle section and matches at least 75% of positions in the best phase; otherwise, skip to avoid overfilling.
 * Specific positional fixes: For wide grids (w >=25), enforce 1's in windows (cols 9-13, centering at 11), convert bay-adjacent 1's/2's to B, fill bays (cols 2-5 with 2's in 3-4, B in 2/5), set solid 4's in cols 16-19, and adjust nines (e.g., if col24=9 and col25=8, swap to B/9).
 * Subtleties include handling variable row widths (check c < w), applying fixes selectively to non-border rows (e.g., r=2 to 26 for some, r=1+ for others), and running pattern completion last on all rows to override or refine fixes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Run lengths must consider only consecutive groups of C, and select the largest possible K among those with max frequency; phases are modulo the unit period (K+1), and best phase prioritizes higher match count then lowest p.
 * Vertical consistency isn't directly handled, but row-wise fixes imply global structure (e.g., alternating row types: solid 3's, patterned with 2/1/4/9, solid 8's).
 * Exclude {B,2} from pattern detection to focus on main structure (3's); if sides are a valid C, exclude it too.
 * For short rows (w<3), do nothing; empty freq means no pattern to complete.
 * Fixes like fix_ones only trigger if 1's exist in target range and w>11; similar conditional logic for others to avoid invalid changes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import collections

def get_group_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, C: int) -> int:
    # Counts the maximum run length of consecutive C's in the range; useful for detecting periodic K in patterns.
    runs = []
    i = start
    while i <= end:
        if row[i] == C:
            length = 0
            while i <= end and row[i] == C:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            runs.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    if not runs:
        return 0
    run_freq = collections.Counter(runs)
    max_f = max(run_freq.values())
    possible_ks = [k for k, v in run_freq.items() if v == max_f]
    return max(possible_ks)
```

```python
def complete_pattern(row: List[int]) -> None:
    # Core function for filling middle section (start to end) with best periodic unit [C]*K + [B], selected via frequency and run analysis.
    # Includes phase shifting for best fit; thresholds prevent over-application.
    # (Full implementation as in the provided program; helpful for handling repeating structures like 3's separated by 8's.)
```

```python
def fix_ones(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, B: int) -> None:
    # Enforces window 1's in cols 9-13 for wide grids, converting extras to B; triggers only if 1's present.
    w = len(grid[0])
    has = any(grid[r][c] == 1 for c in range(9, 13) if c < w)
    if has and 11 < w:
        grid[r][11] = 1
        for c in [9, 10, 12]:
            if c < w and grid[r][c] == 1:
                grid[r][c] = B

def fix_bays(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, B: int) -> None:
    # Fills bay structure in cols 2-5 with 2's in core, B on edges; triggers if any 2's in 2-5.
    w = len(grid[0])
    has = any(grid[r][c] == 2 for c in range(2, 6) if c < w)
    if has:
        for c in [3, 4]:
            if c < w:
                grid[r][c] = 2
        for c in [2, 5]:
            if c < w and grid[r][c] == 2:
                grid[r][c] = B

def fix_nines(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, B: int) -> None:
    # Corrects edge detail: if col24=9 and col25=8, set to B/9 (likely a swap for consistency).
    w = len(grid[0])
    if w > 25 and grid[r][24] == 9 and grid[r][25] == 8:
        grid[r][24] = B
        grid[r][25] = 9

def fix_fours(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> None:
    # Unconditionally fills solid block in cols 16-19 with 4's for all rows.
    w = len(grid[0])
    for c in range(16, 20):
        if c < w:
            grid[r][c] = 4
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating strong handling of basic pattern repetition and positional fixes for those cases.
 * complete_pattern worked well for filling long runs of 3's separated by 8's, as seen in row 1 and 27 of test output matching expected periodic structure.
 * fix_fours successfully enforced 4's in cols 16-19 across all patterned rows, creating consistent solid blocks.
 * fix_bays and fix_ones applied selectively, preserving 2's in some rows (e.g., rows 3,4,6,7) where bays are present, and centering 1's at col 11 while clearing extras.
 * fix_nines corrected specific 9/8 swaps in rows like 4,7,8,12,16,20,24,25, creating [...,8,9,8,...] patterns.
 * However, pattern completion didn't fully symmetrize all rows: e.g., row 3 has asymmetric 1 at col11 and 4's starting at col16, but trailing 3/8's don't mirror leading ones perfectly; unknown if input had noise here.
 * Some rows (e.g., 5,8,9) show 9's in varying positions (col25 or both 24-25), suggesting fix_nines triggered inconsistently or input varied vertically.
 * get_group_size is helpful and accurate for K detection (e.g., max run of 6 for 3's), but could miss if runs are fragmented below threshold.
 * Overall program structure (pre-fix for w>=25, then complete_pattern on all) is solid, but lacks vertical propagation (e.g., aligning 2's or 9's across rows).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though fix_nines is narrow (only triggers on exact 9-8 pair).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and structured, forming a coherent pattern: top/bottom solid 8's, alternating rows of solid 3's (rows 1,27) and detailed patterned rows with left bays (2's in 3-4, B edges), windows (1 at 11), blocks (4's 16-19), and right details (9's near 24-25), separated by vertical 8's and 3's—resembling a row of buildings or a bay window scene.
 * It makes sense as a completed puzzle: periodicity in 3's (groups of 6), consistent fixes (e.g., all patterned rows have 4's filled, 1's centered, bays where input had 2's), and no obvious overfills since thresholds skipped low-match areas.
 * Subtle differences from ideal: Vertical inconsistency in 9's (e.g., row 3 has no 9's, row 4 has at 24-25? Wait, output shows row4: ...8,3,8 with 9's? Actually, parsing shows row4 ends [8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,... wait no—output is flattened, but row5 has 9's at ~24-25, row6 none; this may be intentional for variation or input-driven, not a clear error.
 * No major mismatches noted (e.g., no stray 1's outside 11, bays properly edged with B); it demonstrates core rules like pattern filling and positional enforcement, though if expected output is fully symmetric vertically, it differs slightly in 9/2 placements (unknown without original input, but appears rule-compliant).
 * To handle test fully, ensure fix_nines applies more broadly if 9's appear without exact 8 pair, or add vertical averaging for details.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:18:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 29x29 based on the test input) that represents pixel art or a rendered image with numbers as pixel values (e.g., 8 as background, other digits as foreground elements like shapes or anomalies). The goal is to apply fixes to correct rendering errors, anomalies, or misplacements in objects (e.g., bays, nines, background shifts, and ones) while preserving the intended visual structure, but the program must handle varying grid sizes across inputs without index errors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid dimensions vary: training examples likely have different sizes (e.g., fewer rows or columns), causing index out of range errors when accessing fixed positions like grid[24][3] or ranges up to 28; always validate bounds or use dynamic sizing based on len(grid) and len(grid[0]).
 * Anomalies include specific positional fixes: e.g., a "first bay" at row 24, column 3 needing value 2; "nines" where a 9 followed by 8 in columns 24-25 should swap to 9 in column 25; background shifts in specific rows (6,10,14,18,22,26) setting columns 16 and 19 to 8 and 4; "broken" background in rows 13 and 23 setting column 17 to 4.
 * "Ones" anomalies: in columns 9-12 of rows 2-26, consolidate scattered 1s to column 11, replacing others with 8 (background), but only if any 1 is present in those columns—subtle risk of over-replacing if conditions aren't precise.
 * Puzzle rules imply a structured image (e.g., repeating patterns in rows for shapes like bays or bars, with 3s/4s/9s forming objects); fixes should not alter valid foreground (e.g., don't touch 2s or 3s unintentionally) and must maintain symmetry or repetition seen in test input (e.g., alternating row patterns with 2s, 4s, 9s).
 * Subtle elements: Background is mostly 8s; anomalies might be rendering glitches in a larger scene (e.g., a ship bay or machinery); ensure fixes don't create new anomalies, like mismatched row lengths or overwriting non-anomalous pixels; consider row 0 and 28 as solid background borders.
 * No object extraction needed yet, but future fixes might require identifying "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-8 values) to avoid global changes; training errors suggest the puzzle tests robustness to input size variations.
 * All considerations: Preserve input grid by copying; apply fixes sequentially but idempotently (e.g., fix_nines checks conditions before changing); test input shows vertical repetition every 3 rows (e.g., patterns of 2s in columns 3-4, 1s in column 11, 4s/9s in columns 16-20 and 24-25), so fixes should enhance rather than disrupt this.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No custom types defined in attempt, but could be useful for representing anomalies
from typing import List, Tuple

class AnomalyFix:
    def __init__(self, row: int, col: int, new_value: int):
        self.row = row
        self.col = col
        self.new_value = new_value
```

```python
# Helpful for safe access: prevents index errors in varying grid sizes
def safe_set(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, value: int) -> bool:
    if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):
        grid[r][c] = value
        return True
    return False

# From attempt: fix_nines is somewhat helpful for conditional swaps but assumes fixed columns 24-25
def fix_nines(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(1, rows - 1):  # Dynamic range to avoid out-of-bounds
        if cols > 25 and grid[r][24] == 9 and grid[r][25] == 8:
            grid[r][25] = 9
    return grid

# fix_ones is partially helpful for consolidating but over-applies replacements without full condition check
def fix_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(2, min(27, rows)):
        if cols > 12 and any(grid[r][c] == 1 for c in range(9, 13)):
            grid[r][11] = 1
            for c in [9, 10, 12]:
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    grid[r][c] = 8
    return grid
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) crashed on training examples 1 and 2 due to list index out of range, likely from hard-coded indices (e.g., grid[24][3], range(1,28), range(29)) assuming a fixed 29x29 grid, while training inputs are smaller—shows lack of dynamic sizing.
 * fix_first_bay is broken/unhelpful: hard-codes row 24, col 3 to 2, which fails on smaller grids; not general and assumes specific anomaly position without validation.
 * fix_nines worked conceptually for test (swapped some 8->9 in col 25 where needed) but assumes cols 24-25 exist; didn't crash test but irrelevant/unhelpful for training due to bounds.
 * fix_background_anomalies partially worked on test (set some 8s/4s in specified rows/cols) but hard-codes rows {6,10,14,18,22,26} and {13,23}, cols 16/17/19—causes errors on smaller grids; over-applies without checking if those rows exist, and "shifted/broken" logic seems arbitrary without puzzle context.
 * fix_ones applied consolidations in test (e.g., moved 1s to col 11, set others to 8) but condition is incomplete (sets col 11=1 even if already set, and replaces extras); didn't crash test but would on training; unhelpful as it assumes cols 9-12 and rows 2-26.
 * Overall, program copies grid correctly and sequences fixes, but no error handling—essential for puzzle with variable inputs; missed that fixes should be conditional on grid size and content to avoid side effects.
 * No object extraction function attempted, but it could be essential for identifying anomalies dynamically (e.g., find connected 1s or 9s) rather than position-based hacks.
 * Train 1 and 2: Complete failure due to bounds errors; expected clean execution and corrected grids, but got crashes—difference is total non-execution vs. partial fixes needed.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of anomaly types (bays, nines, background, ones) but ignores input variability.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: it preserved the overall structure (e.g., top/bottom 8 borders, repeating 3s in col 1, 2s in cols 3-4 for some rows, 1s consolidated to col 11, some 9s in cols 24-25, 4s in cols 16-20), and applied fixes like setting background to 8s in shifted rows and fixing some 4s in broken rows—looks like it's attempting to clean up a machinery or bay image.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: e.g., in rows like 4 and 7 (0-indexed), col 18-19 should likely remain 4s for object integrity but got partial overwrites to 8/4 inconsistently; 9s in cols 24-25 are fixed in some places (8->9) but not all (e.g., row 4 has 9,9 already, but fix_nines might redundantly touch); ones are over-consolidated (all scattered 1s forced to col 11=1, extras to 8, but original test has 1 only in col 11, so unnecessary changes could distort shapes); first bay fix at [24][3]=2 might have altered a valid 8 or 3.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should match a "clean" version of the input without anomalies (e.g., perfect symmetry in repeating rows, no stray 1s or shifted backgrounds), but generated has lingering inconsistencies (e.g., row 2 has 1 in col 11 unchanged, but nearby 4s/8s in cols 16-20 not fully aligned with patterns); it's different because fixes are position-specific hacks rather than rule-based (e.g., why rows 6/10/etc. specifically? Unknown if that's puzzle-derived or guessed).
 * Test ran without error (good), but output isn't perfect—missing holistic check for visual coherence (e.g., does the "bay" now render correctly?); account for test's vertical repetition (every 3 rows: type A with 2s and 8s, type B with 2s and 4s, type C with 8s and 4s) by making fixes pattern-aware to handle similar cases.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving row-based pattern completion, where each row has a background color (B), side indicators (often 2's marking boundaries), and a central range that should be filled with a repeating unit pattern consisting of groups of a main color (C) separated by background, based on the most common run length (K) observed in existing non-background, non-indicator cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B is always extracted from the first cell of the row (grid_row[0]), and it dominates as the separator in patterns.
 * Side indicators are at positions 1 and w-2; if both are 2, the pattern range shrinks to 2 to w-3 (avoiding outer sides), otherwise it's 1 to w-2— this handles cases where sides might be part of the pattern or strictly boundaries.
 * Main color C is the most frequent color in the pattern range excluding B and 2's; if none exists, skip the row.
 * Group size K is the mode (most frequent) length of consecutive runs of C in the range; in ties, pick the maximum K to favor longer groups, which seems to align with puzzle emphasis on prominent repeats.
 * The repeating unit is strictly [C] * K + [B], creating a period of K+1; no other colors or variations in the unit.
 * Phase selection maximizes matches to the existing row segment (not overwriting everything blindly, but aligning to preserve observed parts), using a simple cyclic shift and count of agreements.
 * Overwrite only the pattern range with the generated pattern; leave sides and background intact.
 * Subtlety: 2's are treated as placeholders or boundaries, ignored in frequency and runs— they don't count as C or B, so rows with many 2's might skip if no C is found.
 * Edge cases: If no runs of C, fallback K=1 (but rare); empty range skips row; all-B rows stay unchanged.
 * Puzzle assumes per-row independence—no column or global constraints mentioned.
 * Potential miss: If input has mixed colors beyond B/C/2, C selection might pick wrong if frequencies tie (though max freq handles it); phase might not perfectly fit if input is noisy or incomplete.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve existing matches to avoid over-destruction; handle variable widths; ties in mode favor max K for "strongest" pattern.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating solid understanding of row-independent pattern completion with repeating units.
 * Worked: Background extraction, range determination based on sides, C selection via frequency (excluding 2's), K via mode runs with max tiebreaker, phase alignment to preserve matches, and targeted overwrite.
 * Didn't work: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes input has partial patterns; if input is fully blank or all 2's in range, it skips correctly, but might overfit if test has irregular runs.
 * The phase selection favors lowest phase in ties, which is a minor heuristic but helps consistency.
 * Run length calculation is precise (consecutive only), avoiding false groups.
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are targeted; nothing broken, but get_group_size fallback to 1 might be too arbitrary if no C runs (though C existence check precedes it).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output produces a highly repetitive grid with B=8, C=3 patterns: top/bottom rows all 8's (skipped as expected if no C), some rows with groups of six 3's separated by single 8's (e.g., row 2: repeating [3]*6 + [8]), and alternating single 3's separated by 8's in other rows (e.g., row 3: 8,3,8,3,... ending in 8).
 * It looks partially correct and makes sense for a puzzle emphasizing striped/repeating motifs, as it consistently applies the unit [3]*K + [8] with K=6 for grouped rows (likely from observed runs) and K=1 for alternating (single 3's as mode).
 * However, the output does not look fully correct: many rows (e.g., 4,6,7,8,10-12,14-16,18-20,22-24,26-27) end with two 8's (e.g., ...,3,8,8), suggesting the range end or phase alignment clips unevenly, which differs from expected symmetric patterns—possibly the input had 2's at sides causing shrunk range, but output overwrites without preserving potential boundary symmetry.
 * Repetition across rows (e.g., rows 4 and 6 identical) implies the program treats each row independently but might over-apply the same K/phase if input rows are similar; this could be wrong if test expects varied per-row C or K based on subtle input differences (unknown why, but output lacks diversity).
 * Bottom row mirrors row 2 but inverted in grouping, which seems intentional but might mismatch if puzzle rules require global consistency (e.g., no column alignment considered).
 * Overall, test output demonstrates pattern application but appears to homogenize too much—expected output likely has more variation or exact matches to partial input hints, not full overwrites; the all-8 rows are correct (no pattern to complete).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a structured image like a building, ship, or architectural diagram) where numbers symbolize elements such as walls (8), windows or panels (3), decks or floors (4), bays or openings (2), lights or accents (1), and other details (9). The goal is to complete repeating patterns in rows based on side indicators (e.g., 2 for open patterns), consolidate or fill specific elements in designated columns/rows, and ensure symmetry or consistency across the grid while treating 8 as a neutral background or wall that can be overwritten or preserved.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are processed individually for pattern completion only if the second (index 1) and second-last (index -2) cells are both 2, indicating "open" sides for patterning; otherwise, the pattern range shifts inward (1 to width-2 vs. 2 to width-3) to respect borders.
 * Patterns are repeating units of K consecutive instances of the main color C (most frequent non-border non-2 value in the range), followed by a single border color B (from row[0]); K is the mode run length of C, with ties broken by maximum K—subtlety: if no runs, fallback to K=1, which could overfill sparse areas.
 * Best phase alignment maximizes matches to existing cells before overwriting, preserving partial patterns but potentially forcing uniform repeats that ignore vertical consistency or global structure.
 * Fixes are conditional (e.g., only if top-left is 8, suggesting a "walled" grid type) and target specific rows (2-26 for most, 1-27 for bays): consolidate 1s to column 11 (and set others to 8) if any in 9-12; move 9s from 24 to 25 (setting 24 to 8); fill 16-19 with 4s if not already; consolidate 2s to columns 3-4 (setting others in 2-5 to 8) if any in 2-5—subtlety: these assume fixed column indices, ignoring grid width variations, and overwrite to 8, which could erase intended details if misapplied.
 * Global considerations: Grid is copied to avoid mutating input; width assumed consistent (29 columns in test); patterns assume horizontal repetition only, no vertical propagation; 8 acts as erasable filler but is used as separator in units; potential for overfilling if input has noise (e.g., stray 3s leading to C=3 everywhere); symmetry not enforced, but test output shows near-mirroring on sides; rows 0 and 28 are untouched (all 8s, likely top/bottom borders).
 * Easy-to-miss: Border B from row[0] may vary per row, allowing row-specific colors; no handling for empty ranges or all-2/ all-B rows; fixes don't check for conflicts (e.g., filling 4s over a pattern); no extraction of "objects" like full structures, just row-wise ops—could miss holistic elements like connected components.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary submission): No prior versions shown, but code includes fallbacks (e.g., None for C returns early) that prevent crashes but may leave rows incomplete.

    """Determine the start and end indices for pattern cells based on side values."""
    if left == 2 and right == 2:
        return 2, width - 3
    return 1, width - 2
```
(This is helpful for conditional range adjustment based on side indicators.)

    for c in range(start, end + 1):
        val = row[c]
        if val != B and val != 2:
            freq[val] += 1
    if not freq:
        return None
    return max(freq, key=freq.get)
```
(This is core for identifying dominant pattern color C, excluding borders and specials.)

    """Compute the mode group size K for consecutive runs of C in the range. In case of tie, choose the maximum K."""
    runs = []
    i = start
    while i <= end:
        if row[i] == C:
            length = 0
            while i <= end and row[i] == C:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            runs.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    if not runs:
        return 1  # Fallback, though shouldn't occur
    run_freq = collections.Counter(runs)
    max_f = run_freq.most_common(1)[0][1]
    possible_ks = [k for k, v in run_freq.items() if v == max_f]
    return max(possible_ks)
```
(This accurately computes run-length mode for pattern grouping, with tiebreaker—essential for unit construction.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], start: int, unit: List[int], period: int, num: int) -> int:
    """Find the phase with the maximum matches to the input row segment."""
    best_phase = 0
    best_count = -1
    for p in range(period):
        count = 0
        for j in range(num):
            pat = unit[(j + p) % period]
            if pat == row[start + j]:
                count += 1
        if count > best_count or (count == best_count and p < best_phase):
            best_count = count
            best_phase = p
    return best_phase
```
(This aligns the repeating unit to existing data, preserving matches—key for natural completion.)

(The fix functions like fix_ones, fix_nines, fix_fours, fix_bays are helpful for targeted consolidations but are column-specific and may need generalization for variable widths.)

(No object extraction functions present; could add one to identify connected components of colors like 3s for "windows" to enforce vertical alignment, e.g.:)
```python
def extract_windows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (row_start, col, height)
    """Extract connected vertical runs of 3s as window objects."""
    windows = []
    # Implementation to scan columns for vertical 3-runs, ignoring 8s/others
    return windows
```
(This would be helpful for future attempts to handle vertical patterns, which current code misses.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; no earlier versions detailed, but it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 fully (correct outputs), demonstrating understanding of row-wise pattern repetition and fixes.
 * Worked well: Pattern completion via unit repetition and phase alignment correctly fills open-sided rows with consistent groups (e.g., [3]*K + [8]); fixes properly consolidate specials (1s to col 11, 2s to 3-4, etc.) without side effects in training.
 * Did not work/partial: No vertical consistency enforced, so horizontal fills may misalign columns (e.g., 3s not stacking into full windows); assumes B=row[0] uniform, but if borders vary, patterns could clash; fallback K=1 may create unwanted singles in sparse rows; no handling for non-8 backgrounds or grids without top-left 8 (skips fixes).
 * Subtle misses: Overwriting ignores potential pre-existing vertical objects (e.g., multi-row 4s or 3s); column-hardcoded fixes (e.g., 9-12 for 1s) fail if width <25+; no symmetry check, leading to asymmetric fills if input is noisy.
 * Function complete_single_row is core and helpful; get_pattern_range handles side conditions well.
 * Functions like fix_ones/fix_nines are helpful but narrow—broken if columns exceed grid width (no bounds check beyond continue); not general for other specials.
 * No unhelpful functions; all are relevant, but pattern logic assumes C !=2/B, missing cases where 2 is part of pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output produces a highly repetitive grid: rows 0/28 all 8s (untouched borders); row 1/27 have groups of six 3s separated by single 8s (suggesting K=6 for C=3, B=8, full repeat across open range); rows 2-26 alternate between two patterns—type A (e.g., row 2: starts 8,3,8,3,... up to col 15=3, then 4x4s in 16-19, then 8,3,8,3,... ending 8, implying K=1 singles) and type B (e.g., row 3: starts 8,8,3,8,... then 4s, then 3,8,3,... ending 8,8, shifted phase or range).
 * Effects observed: fix_fours applied uniformly (4s in cols 16-19 for rows 2-26, overwriting any non-4); no 1s/9s/2s visible (suggesting consolidation to 8 or positions, or absent in input); left/right sides near-mirror but with phase shifts (e.g., type A has 16 singles of 3 before 4s, type B has 15 with double-8 starts/ends); overall creates a "faceted" wall with window slits (single 3s) and a central deck block (4s), bookended by denser window rows.
 * Does not look fully correct: Repetition is too rigid—alternating row types suggest inconsistent side values (some rows have row[1]=3 or 8, shifting range/phase), but if input had uniform 2-sides, all rows should match (over-application?); right side post-4s has 8,3 repeats but shorter (8 cells vs. left's 16), breaking symmetry (expected mirror for building-like puzzle); no vertical stacking (e.g., 3s don't align into columns of windows, just horizontal scratches); groups of six 3s in rows 1/27 fit a header/footer, but singles elsewhere imply wrong K detection (mode tie or sparse input leading to max K=1 fallback?); without input grid, can't confirm, but output feels "noisy" not structured—likely misses vertical rules or object-based filling (e.g., bays as 2s should stack, but fixed to 8s/3s).
 * Differences from expected: Expected a more coherent structure (e.g., uniform window columns of 3s across rows, symmetric bays at cols 3-4 with 2s preserved/filled vertically, 4s only where intended not blanket); generated has fragmented 3s (singles vs. groups), no visible 2s/1s/9s (over-erased?), and repetitive but misaligned rows—probably incorrect phase/K or missing global alignment; subtle: if input had partial patterns, phase matching worked locally but created vertical mismatches (e.g., col 2: 3 in row2, 8 in row3).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves completing and correcting a grid representing a visual pattern, likely a pixel-art style image such as a landscape or architectural scene, where a background color (B, often 8) is filled in, and foreground elements like repeating structures (e.g., walls or patterns with 3's), bays (2's), windows (1's), solid blocks (4's), and edge details (9's) are detected and enforced across rows to match an expected symmetric or periodic design. The goal is to apply rule-based fixes and pattern completions to transform an incomplete or noisy input grid into a clean, consistent output that adheres to implicit structural rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B (e.g., 8) dominates borders and separators; never overwrite confirmed B positions unless part of a specific fix like bays or nines.
 * Rows often follow periodic patterns, such as repeating units of K instances of a color C followed by B (e.g., [3]*6 + [8]); detect the most frequent run length K for the dominant non-B color in the middle section, excluding sides and low-frequency colors like 2.
 * Side elements (positions 1 and w-2) may indicate asymmetric patterns; if they match and differ from B, treat one side as a pattern guide but exclude it from frequency counts to avoid skewing.
 * Thresholds are critical: only apply pattern completion if the dominant color appears in at least 25% of the middle section and matches at least 75% of positions in the best phase; otherwise, skip to avoid overfilling.
 * Specific positional fixes: For wide grids (w >=25), enforce 1's in windows (cols 9-13, centering at 11), convert bay-adjacent 1's/2's to B, fill bays (cols 2-5 with 2's in 3-4, B in 2/5), set solid 4's in cols 16-19, and adjust nines (e.g., if col24=9 and col25=8, swap to B/9).
 * Subtleties include handling variable row widths (check c < w), applying fixes selectively to non-border rows (e.g., r=2 to 26 for some, r=1+ for others), and running pattern completion last on all rows to override or refine fixes.
 * Easy-to-miss: Run lengths must consider only consecutive groups of C, and select the largest possible K among those with max frequency; phases are modulo the unit period (K+1), and best phase prioritizes higher match count then lowest p.
 * Vertical consistency isn't directly handled, but row-wise fixes imply global structure (e.g., alternating row types: solid 3's, patterned with 2/1/4/9, solid 8's).
 * Exclude {B,2} from pattern detection to focus on main structure (3's); if sides are a valid C, exclude it too.
 * For short rows (w<3), do nothing; empty freq means no pattern to complete.
 * Fixes like fix_ones only trigger if 1's exist in target range and w>11; similar conditional logic for others to avoid invalid changes.

 * fix_bays and fix_ones applied selectively, preserving 2's in some rows (e.g., rows 3,4,6,7) where bays are present, and centering 1's at col 11 while clearing extras.
 * fix_nines corrected specific 9/8 swaps in rows like 4,7,8,12,16,20,24,25, creating [...,8,9,8,...] patterns.
 * However, pattern completion didn't fully symmetrize all rows: e.g., row 3 has asymmetric 1 at col11 and 4's starting at col16, but trailing 3/8's don't mirror leading ones perfectly; unknown if input had noise here.
 * Some rows (e.g., 5,8,9) show 9's in varying positions (col25 or both 24-25), suggesting fix_nines triggered inconsistently or input varied vertically.
 * get_group_size is helpful and accurate for K detection (e.g., max run of 6 for 3's), but could miss if runs are fragmented below threshold.
 * Overall program structure (pre-fix for w>=25, then complete_pattern on all) is solid, but lacks vertical propagation (e.g., aligning 2's or 9's across rows).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though fix_nines is narrow (only triggers on exact 9-8 pair).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and structured, forming a coherent pattern: top/bottom solid 8's, alternating rows of solid 3's (rows 1,27) and detailed patterned rows with left bays (2's in 3-4, B edges), windows (1 at 11), blocks (4's 16-19), and right details (9's near 24-25), separated by vertical 8's and 3's—resembling a row of buildings or a bay window scene.
 * It makes sense as a completed puzzle: periodicity in 3's (groups of 6), consistent fixes (e.g., all patterned rows have 4's filled, 1's centered, bays where input had 2's), and no obvious overfills since thresholds skipped low-match areas.
 * Subtle differences from ideal: Vertical inconsistency in 9's (e.g., row 3 has no 9's, row 4 has at 24-25? Wait, output shows row4: ...8,3,8 with 9's? Actually, parsing shows row4 ends [8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,... wait no—output is flattened, but row5 has 9's at ~24-25, row6 none; this may be intentional for variation or input-driven, not a clear error.
 * No major mismatches noted (e.g., no stray 1's outside 11, bays properly edged with B); it demonstrates core rules like pattern filling and positional enforcement, though if expected output is fully symmetric vertically, it differs slightly in 9/2 placements (unknown without original input, but appears rule-compliant).
 * To handle test fully, ensure fix_nines applies more broadly if 9's appear without exact 8 pair, or add vertical averaging for details.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

[2025-10-02 08:27:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual pattern-completion puzzle on a grid where each row starts and ends with a background color (often 8), and the task is to fill or correct the middle sections with repeating patterns of a primary color (C) separated by background (B=8), while preserving special elements like 2s (possibly bays or windows), 1s, 4s, and 9s (which appear to represent numeric labels or fixed features in a larger image, such as a ship or structure diagram). The program processes rows iteratively, applying general pattern detection and specific positional fixes to enforce consistency across similar rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are processed independently but with global height/width awareness; borders (columns 0 and w-1) are always background (8), and edges (columns 1 and w-2) may preserve 2s if detected as "bays."
 * Pattern completion identifies a main non-background, non-2 color (C) in the core (columns 2 to w-3 or adjusted), requires it to appear in at least 25% of cells, computes the most frequent run length (K) of C groups, and fits a repeating unit of K Cs followed by one B, using the best phase shift for at least 75% match before overwriting.
 * Specific fixes are conditional on width (w) thresholds and row position: e.g., bays (2s in columns 2-5) trigger filling around them with B and 2s; 1s in columns 9-12 trigger surrounding Bs; 9s in 24-25 trigger partial B fill; 4s in 16-19 are force-filled; a special 2 in row 24, column 3 if starting with 8.
 * Fixes only apply if row starts with 8 and is not on edges (r 1 to h-2), and w >=25 for most; they run before and after pattern completion to handle interactions.
 * Subtle elements: Ignore 2s and B in main color detection; handle empty runs by defaulting K=1; phase selection prefers lower p on ties; patterns may vary slightly per row (e.g., inserting 1s or 9s disrupts uniformity, requiring targeted fixes); all-8 rows (top/bottom) remain untouched; 0s seem like unfilled placeholders to be overwritten by patterns.
 * Easy-to-miss: Overwriting must avoid fixed specials (e.g., don't touch confirmed 1/4/9 positions); frequency thresholds prevent overzealous filling on low-C rows; run length uses max frequency of run sizes, taking the largest such K; input may have partial patterns, so completion assumes repetition unless specials intervene.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): No multi-row interactions (e.g., vertical alignment) are handled, which might be needed if patterns span rows; 0s are treated as fillable but not distinguished from other non-C; no error handling for invalid grids.

        return True
    return False

    if left == 2 and right == 2:
        return 2, width - 3
    return 1, width - 2

def get_main_color(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, B: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # Finds the most frequent non-B, non-2 color in a row segment. Returns None if none found. Core for identifying C.

        val = row[c]
        if val != B and val != 2:
            freq[val] += 1
    if not freq:
        return None
    return max(freq, key=freq.get)

def get_group_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, C: int) -> int:
    # Computes the largest most-frequent run length of C in the segment. Defaults to 1 if no runs. Key for pattern unit length.

        if row[i] == C:
            length = 0

                length += 1

    max_f = run_freq.most_common(1)[0][1]
    possible_ks = [k for k, v in run_freq.items() if v == max_f]
    return max(possible_ks)

def find_best_phase(row: List[int], start: int, unit: List[int], period: int, num: int) -> int:

        count = 0
        for j in range(num):

```

```python
# Specific fix functions (e.g., fix_bays, fix_ones, etc.) are helpful for targeted corrections around specials like 1,4,9 but are hardcoded to positions, limiting generality.
def fix_bays(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, w: int, B: int):
    if w < 6:
        return
    has_bay = any(safe_set(grid, r, c, 0) and grid[r][c] == 2 for c in range(2, 6))  # Note: safe_set sets to 0 unnecessarily here, potential bug.
    if not has_bay:
        return
    safe_set(grid, r, 2, B)
    safe_set(grid, r, 3, 2)
    safe_set(grid, r, 4, 2)
    safe_set(grid, r, 5, B)

# Similar for fix_ones, fix_nines, fix_fours: Position-specific, w-thresholded fills around detected specials.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 by correctly applying pattern completion and fixes to produce uniform repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s or 4s separated by 8s) while preserving specials.
 * Pattern completion works well for main body (e.g., filling 0s with C/B repeats if >75% match), but specific fixes are brittle—e.g., fix_bays checks for 2s but sets to 0 in the any() which may alter the grid unexpectedly; fix_ones/fix_nines assume exact positions (9-12, 24-25) without scanning.
 * apply_specific_fixes skips non-8 starting rows or edge rows, which is good for borders but misses potential patterns elsewhere; running fixes twice (before/after completion) helps iterate but may over-apply if not idempotent.
 * get_group_size correctly handles runs but defaults to K=1 on no runs, which could force unwanted single-C patterns; phase finding is solid but only counts exact matches, ignoring partial disruptions like 1s.
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., bays as groups of 2s or numbers as fixed blobs) beyond simple checks— a more general object detector (e.g., finding connected 1/9 components) might help, but current positional hacks suffice for training.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The has_bay check in fix_bays uses safe_set to 0, which modifies the grid during detection (buggy, don't reuse as-is); get_pattern_range assumes left/right are edge values but doesn't dynamically detect 2s beyond input args.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: Top/bottom rows are all 8s (correct, untouched borders); most middle rows show consistent patterns like left bay (3,0x4,3), then 8-separated sections with 3s (possibly C=3, K=1-6 varying), a 1 in column 11, 4s in 16-19, and right sections with 8s and occasional 9s in 25, ending with 3,8— this aligns with pattern completion filling 0s and fixes enforcing 1/4/9/2 placements.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Inconsistencies across rows, e.g., row 1 has solid 3s in columns 9-13 and 23-27 (no disruptions), while rows 2+ insert 8s/1/8 around column 11 (fix_ones applied), but row 24 uniquely has 2 in column 3 (from fix_first_bay) and 0s lingering in 4-5 (not fully filled by pattern?); some rows have 9 in 25, others 8 (fix_nines applied selectively, but why not uniform?); right side column 26-27 varies (8,3 vs 9,8,3), suggesting incomplete pattern propagation or threshold failure (e.g., <25% C or <75% match skipped filling). Expected: More uniform repetition (e.g., all similar rows should have identical 3/8 patterns except fixed specials), no residual 0s, and vertical alignment (e.g., 9s stacking consistently if labeling a feature). Differences: Lingering 0s indicate pattern_completion skipped some rows (unknown why—perhaps low freq_c); non-uniform 9 placements suggest has_nine detection misses partial cases; overall, it demonstrates core repeating pattern understanding but fails subtle uniformity and full overwrite.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:27:51] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of obvious and consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in **both** train pairs. I focused only on consistent patterns across **every** example, ignoring one-off or inconsistent elements (e.g., vertical stacking in Train 2 lower rows does not appear in Train 1, so excluded; large frame components like the outer Green or Red with holes=1 remain unchanged and do not interact). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted—only direct, observable effects like color changes or splitting based on position/properties. Unknowns (e.g., exact choice of alternating color when neighbors are ambiguous) are noted as such.

- **Horizontal position within a row affects color transformation in connected same-color components**: In both train pairs, pixels in the same row (e.g., y=2 in Train 1; y=2/3, y=7/8, y=17/18 in Train 2) that form a horizontal run (connected bbox spanning multiple x positions, pixels >1) trigger a split. The internal pixel(s) at specific positions (e.g., middle of odd-length run) change color, breaking the component into smaller ones (e.g., Green run of 3 pixels at [7,2,9,2] splits to Green1 at x=7, new Blue1 at x=8, Green1 at x=9 in Train 1; Blue run of ~3 pixels at [8,7,10,8] splits to Blue1 at x=8, new Yellow1 at x=9, Blue1 at x=10 in Train 2). This is consistent for runs >1 pixel wide; no vertical runs show this effect.

- **Neighboring component color affects the new color in split runs**: The inserted/changed color in a split run matches the color of the immediate horizontal neighbor outside the run, enforcing local alternation (e.g., Blue neighbors cause Green run to insert Blue in Train 1; Yellow neighbors cause Blue run to insert Yellow in Train 2; similar for Light Blue run inserting Yellow next to Yellow neighbors in Train 2). This interaction is consistent in both trains for horizontal runs only; the "alternating" pair (e.g., Blue-Green or Blue-Yellow) varies by row but always derives from neighbors. Unknown: Exact rule if neighbors on both sides differ (not observed in trains).

- **Run length (via pixels and bbox width) affects splitting pattern**: Components with bbox width >1 and pixels indicating horizontal connectivity (e.g., pixels ≈ width for 1-high run) consistently split into length-1 sub-components via color change (e.g., 3-pixel run splits to three 1-pixel components in Train 1; 4-pixel connected Blue [width 3, height 2] splits to multiple 1-pixel in Train 2 y=7/8). Vertical extent (height >1) does not trigger splitting unless horizontally connected (e.g., 2-high blocks in Train 2 top row split horizontally but retain height). No effect on isolated 1-pixel or 1-wide components. Consistent in both trains; total pixels preserved post-split, but holes=0 unchanged.

- **Block structure (e.g., 2-wide vs. 1-wide in multi-row strips) interacts with position to adjust adjacent blocks**: In Train 2 top row (y=2-3), a 2-wide Yellow block (bbox width=2, pixels=4, invalid for 1-wide pattern) interacts with the following 2-wide Green block, causing color changes in specific columns: second Yellow column changes to Green (merging temporarily), and second Green column changes to Yellow (splitting off a new 1-wide Yellow). Result: Y2 G2 → Y1 G2 Y1, preserving total width and pixels but enforcing 2-wide Green / 1-wide Yellow pattern. This block-level horizontal interaction is not in Train 1 (no multi-wide blocks), but the pixel-level splitting (point 1) is analogous and consistent. Unknown: Trigger for "invalid" block size (assumed 1-wide max for Yellow, 2-wide max for Green based on pre-split pattern).

- **Containment by frame components affects isolation of inner interactions**: Inner horizontal elements (small Blue/Green/Yellow/Light Blue components, bbox inside Red or large Yellow frame) interact only within their row and are unaffected by frame properties (e.g., frames' holes=1 or large bbox do not change and do not alter inner pixels). This isolation is consistent in both trains—interactions stay horizontal and inner, with no spillover to frames or vertical direction. No color/position effect from frame on inners observed.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., hole count does not affect transformations in either train; vertical position does not trigger changes; Maroon components in Train 2 merge horizontally but not consistently with Train 1's lack of Maroon). For the test input, similar horizontal run-splitting could apply within columns, but vertical stacking shows no consistent transformation across trains, so marked unknown.

[2025-10-02 08:31:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of obvious and consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in **both** train pairs. I focused only on consistent patterns across **every** example, ignoring one-off or inconsistent elements (e.g., vertical stacking in Train 2 lower rows does not appear in Train 1, so excluded; large frame components like the outer Green or Red with holes=1 remain unchanged and do not interact). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted—only direct, observable effects like color changes or splitting based on position/properties. Unknowns (e.g., exact choice of alternating color when neighbors are ambiguous) are noted as such.

- **Horizontal position within a row affects color transformation in connected same-color components**: In both train pairs, pixels in the same row (e.g., y=2 in Train 1; y=2/3, y=7/8, y=17/18 in Train 2) that form a horizontal run (connected bbox spanning multiple x positions, pixels >1) trigger a split. The internal pixel(s) at specific positions (e.g., middle of odd-length run) change color, breaking the component into smaller ones (e.g., Green run of 3 pixels at [7,2,9,2] splits to Green1 at x=7, new Blue1 at x=8, Green1 at x=9 in Train 1; Blue run of ~3 pixels at [8,7,10,8] splits to Blue1 at x=8, new Yellow1 at x=9, Blue1 at x=10 in Train 2). This is consistent for runs >1 pixel wide; no vertical runs show this effect.

- **Neighboring component color affects the new color in split runs**: The inserted/changed color in a split run matches the color of the immediate horizontal neighbor outside the run, enforcing local alternation (e.g., Blue neighbors cause Green run to insert Blue in Train 1; Yellow neighbors cause Blue run to insert Yellow in Train 2; similar for Light Blue run inserting Yellow next to Yellow neighbors in Train 2). This interaction is consistent in both trains for horizontal runs only; the "alternating" pair (e.g., Blue-Green or Blue-Yellow) varies by row but always derives from neighbors. Unknown: Exact rule if neighbors on both sides differ (not observed in trains).

- **Run length (via pixels and bbox width) affects splitting pattern**: Components with bbox width >1 and pixels indicating horizontal connectivity (e.g., pixels ≈ width for 1-high run) consistently split into length-1 sub-components via color change (e.g., 3-pixel run splits to three 1-pixel components in Train 1; 4-pixel connected Blue [width 3, height 2] splits to multiple 1-pixel in Train 2 y=7/8). Vertical extent (height >1) does not trigger splitting unless horizontally connected (e.g., 2-high blocks in Train 2 top row split horizontally but retain height). No effect on isolated 1-pixel or 1-wide components. Consistent in both trains; total pixels preserved post-split, but holes=0 unchanged.

- **Block structure (e.g., 2-wide vs. 1-wide in multi-row strips) interacts with position to adjust adjacent blocks**: In Train 2 top row (y=2-3), a 2-wide Yellow block (bbox width=2, pixels=4, invalid for 1-wide pattern) interacts with the following 2-wide Green block, causing color changes in specific columns: second Yellow column changes to Green (merging temporarily), and second Green column changes to Yellow (splitting off a new 1-wide Yellow). Result: Y2 G2 → Y1 G2 Y1, preserving total width and pixels but enforcing 2-wide Green / 1-wide Yellow pattern. This block-level horizontal interaction is not in Train 1 (no multi-wide blocks), but the pixel-level splitting (point 1) is analogous and consistent. Unknown: Trigger for "invalid" block size (assumed 1-wide max for Yellow, 2-wide max for Green based on pre-split pattern).

- **Containment by frame components affects isolation of inner interactions**: Inner horizontal elements (small Blue/Green/Yellow/Light Blue components, bbox inside Red or large Yellow frame) interact only within their row and are unaffected by frame properties (e.g., frames' holes=1 or large bbox do not change and do not alter inner pixels). This isolation is consistent in both trains—interactions stay horizontal and inner, with no spillover to frames or vertical direction. No color/position effect from frame on inners observed.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., hole count does not affect transformations in either train; vertical position does not trigger changes; Maroon components in Train 2 merge horizontally but not consistently with Train 1's lack of Maroon). For the test input, similar horizontal run-splitting could apply within columns, but vertical stacking shows no consistent transformation across trains, so marked unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 08:43:38] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid puzzle involving pattern correction in a 2D array of integers representing colors, where the goal is to enforce structured rules like solid borders, maximum run lengths for specific colors (e.g., 1 and 9 limited to length 1, 2 and 3 to 2, 8 to 3), single-pixel separators (color 4), and alternating patterns (between 1 and 3) in inner regions without separators, all while preserving overall shapes like frames or sections divided by borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (often color 2 or 4) must be solid and unbroken runs of exact lengths (e.g., all 2's in inner frames of example 1, all 4's in outer frames of example 2); inserting separators (4) into them breaks this and is a common failure.
 * Inner regions between borders should alternate strictly between 1 and 3 if no 4 separator is present, starting from the leftmost inner color, but only apply to 1/3 pixels—do not alter other colors or borders.
 * Separators (4) should be single pixels; runs of 2+ should be reduced by changing one 4 to merge with an adjacent main run (preferring the side that hits the exact max run length k for that color), but avoid creating new issues like over-long runs or border breaks.
 * Main color runs (1,2,3,8,9) must not exceed their max lengths (1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 8:3, 9:1); excess should insert a single 4 separator at the (k+1)th position, but only in inner areas—not borders.
 * Subtle: Vertical alignment matters implicitly (e.g., patterns in example 2 show symmetric sections like pairs of rows with 3's or 1's separated by 4's); horizontal fixes shouldn't disrupt vertical consistency.
 * Grids have frame-like structures: outer solid colors, inner divided into sections with repeating motifs (e.g., 1-4-1-4 for color 1 in example 2, 3-3-4 for color 3).
 * Colors like 8 and 9 follow run rules but appear in specific motif sections (e.g., 8-8-8-4 repeats); assume max_runs dict is fixed but confirm via examples.
 * Easy to miss: No changes to border colors (2 or 4 runs); alternating only skips non-1/3; merging separators prefers exact k-match but falls back safely; process order matters (alternating first, then separators, then main runs).
 * Across attempts: No vertical processing yet— all fixes are row-wise, but examples suggest vertical symmetry (e.g., duplicated row pairs in example 2); potential need for column-wise checks.
 * Other considerations: Inputs may have invalid colors (e.g., test has potential negatives?); output must use only positive 1-9,4,2—no negatives or zeros.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict
from copy import deepcopy

def flip_color(c: int) -> int:
    """Flips between 1 and 3 via 4 - c; useful for alternating enforcement but assumes c in {1,3}—broken if c=4 or other."""
    return 4 - c
```

```python
def find_inner_bounds(row: List[int], border_color: int = 2) -> tuple:
    """Finds start/end between border color positions; helpful for isolating inner regions but assumes exactly two borders—fails if more/fewer or non-2 borders (e.g., 4 in ex2)."""
    borders = [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == border_color]
    if len(borders) >= 2:
        return borders[0] + 1, borders[-1] - 1
    return 0, len(row) - 1
```

```python
def get_adjacent_run_length(row: List[int], pos: int, direction: int, sep_color: int) -> tuple:
    """Computes run length and color adjacent to a position; essential for separator merging logic, correctly handles direction but assumes no nested separators."""
    c = row[pos]
    if c == sep_color:
        return 0, None
    length = 1
    step = 1 if direction > 0 else -1
    p = pos + step
    while 0 <= p < len(row) and row[p] == c:
        length += 1
        p += step
    return length, c
```

*The fix_alternating_regions, fix_separator_runs, and fix_main_runs functions are partially helpful for row-wise enforcement but are broken in combination: they insert 4's into borders (ex1 row1/3), fail to merge properly (ex2 keeps extra 4's in 2-runs), and produce invalid -4's in test (likely from flip_color on invalid input or deepcopy bug). Do not reuse without fixes for border protection and vertical checks. No object extraction functions present or needed—puzzle is rule-based correction, not object detection.*

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt models core run length limits and separator fixes correctly in theory (e.g., max_runs dict matches ex2 patterns like 3-3-4, 8-8-8-4, 1-4-1) but fails execution: inserts unwanted 4's into solid 2-borders in ex1 (generated row1: [3,2,2,4,...] vs expected all 2's inner), leaving extra 4's in ex2 (e.g., row2: keeps 4 in 2-run vs expected solid 2's).
 * Alternating fix works partially for no-sep rows (e.g., ex1 row2/4 inner becomes alternating but skips borders correctly) but over-applies or skips in mixed cases.
 * Separator run fix prefers k-match merging but falls back poorly, creating border breaks (ex1) or no changes (ex2 row2 has 4 where expected 2).
 * Main run fix inserts 4's correctly for excess but after separator fix, so order amplifies errors (e.g., ex2 row7 keeps 4-1-4 but expected 1-4-1 with singles).
 * No vertical processing, missing symmetry in ex2 (e.g., duplicated rows not aligned).
 * flip_color is helpful but unhelpful/broken for non-1/3 inputs, leading to potential crashes (though not seen here).
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of horizontal rules but not full grid structure; train1 mismatches border solidity for unknown reason (possibly inner_bounds assuming border=2 but ex2 uses 4); train2 keeps too many 4's in frames for unknown reason (fallback logic not triggering).
 * find_inner_bounds is essential but limited to border=2—extend for 4.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and is clearly broken: contains invalid negative values like -4 (e.g., row1: [8,8,-4,8,...]), which shouldn't exist (colors are 1-9,2,4); this suggests a bug like flip_color on invalid input or arithmetic error in fixes, making the entire output nonsensical.
 * Patterns are chaotic (e.g., row2 has alternating -4 and 8 but expected likely structured 8-runs of 3 separated by 4's, with 3/1/9 motifs in inner sections per ex2 style); no solid borders or symmetry visible.
 * Missing key elements like single 4 separators and exact run lengths (e.g., 8-runs exceed 3 without proper splits; 1/9 not isolated); does not resemble expected frame-with-sections (test input hints at large 8-border with inner 3/1/8/9 patterns, but output garbles it).
 * To handle test, must prevent negatives (sanitize inputs?), enforce vertical row-pair symmetry, and protect large 8-borders from insertions.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:43:51] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both train 1 and train 2) and do not vary or appear inconsistently. I focused only on components with clear, repeated interactions (e.g., via position, color, bbox overlap/proximity, holes, or pixel counts) that affect each other. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone single pixels with no adjacent changes) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation explanation is provided. Where a connection's mechanism cannot be clearly tied to consistent properties without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Large Enclosing Frames and Internal Small Elements**
   - **Components Involved**: Large colored regions with `holes > 0` (typically 1 or more), large bbox spanning the grid edges (e.g., x from 0-12 or 0-28, y from 0-4 or 0-28), and high pixel counts (e.g., 32-193 pixels). Colors: Green, Red, Yellow, Maroon. These act as frames or borders.
     - Examples: Train 1 Green (`holes=1, bbox=[0,0,12,4], pixels=32`), Red (`holes=1, bbox=[1,1,11,3], pixels=24`); Train 2 Red (`holes=1, bbox=[1,1,20,4], pixels=44` and similar horizontal strips), Yellow (`holes=4, bbox=[0,0,21,20], pixels=142`), Maroon (multiple large instances).
   - **Internal Elements**: Small pixelated components (pixels=1-9, `holes=0`) inside the bbox, such as single or multi-pixel blocks of Blue, Green, Yellow, Light Blue.
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Enclosure and boundary definition. The large frames' bbox and position fully contain the internal small elements' bboxes, constraining their y-range (e.g., small elements at fixed y=2 in train 1 within y=0-4 frame; horizontal strips in train 2 at y=1-4, 6-9, etc., containing alternating patterns). Pixel counts of internals remain stable unless affected by other interactions (see below), but their positions are bounded by frame edges/holes. This enclosure is consistent and does not change between input/output in either train.
   - **Properties Linking Them**: Bbox overlap (internals fully nested), holes in frames (indicating cutouts for internals), position (frames define grid limits, internals fill interior rows/columns).
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in both trains; frames do not transform but consistently affect internal positioning.

#### 2. **Multi-Pixel Blocks and Adjacent Single-Pixel Elements of Contrasting Colors**
   - **Components Involved**: Horizontal multi-pixel blocks (`holes=0`, pixels ≥3, bbox width ≥3 in x, often height=1 or 2) of one color, positioned between single-pixel (or narrow vertical) elements (`pixels=1-2`, `holes=0`, bbox size 1x1 or 1x2) of a different color.
     - Block Colors: Green (train 1: `pixels=3, bbox=[7,2,9,2]`), Light Blue (train 2: `pixels=5, bbox=[8,17,10,18]`).
     - Adjacent Single Colors: Blue (flanking Green in train 1), Yellow (flanking Light Blue in train 2).
     - Examples: Train 1 Green block at x=7-9 (y=2) between Blue at x=6 and x=10; Train 2 Light Blue at x=8-10 (y=17-18) between Yellow at x=7 and x=11.
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Splitting and insertion based on proximity. The multi-pixel block's position and pixel count interact with the adjacent singles' color and positions, resulting in the block being divided (pixel count reduced per sub-block) and a single pixel of the adjacent color inserted at the midpoint of the block's x-range. This adjusts bboxes: original block splits into smaller blocks (e.g., pixels=1 each in train 1; pixels=2 each in train 2 for vertical adjustment), with insertion creating a new single-pixel element at the center x.
     - Effect: Pixel counts redistribute (e.g., 3 → 1+1+1 in train 1; 5 → 2+2+2 with insertion in train 2, approximating split). Positions shift slightly for sub-blocks (e.g., original x=7-9 → x=7, x=9 with insert at x=8).
   - **Properties Linking Them**: Position (block flanked by adjacents within 1-4 x-units), color contrast (block color ≠ adjacent color), pixel count (multi ≥3 triggers split), bbox (horizontal alignment in same y-range).
   - **Consistency Note**: Occurs in both trains with identical flanking pattern (same color on both sides of block). Does not apply to vertical-only or isolated singles. No such split in non-flanked blocks.

#### 3. **Red Horizontal Strips and Enclosed Alternating Patterns**
   - **Components Involved**: Large Red strips (`holes=1`, bbox with fixed height ~3 units, wide x-span like [1,1,20,4], pixels ~44), enclosing alternating small elements.
     - Enclosed Elements: Pairs or sequences of small Green/Yellow (train 2 top: Green blocks `pixels=4, bbox width=2` alternating with Yellow `pixels=2, bbox width=1 vertical`) or Blue/Yellow (train 2 middle: singles at y=7-8).
     - Examples: Train 2 Red [1,1,20,4] enclosing Green-Yellow-Green-... at y=2-3; Red [1,6,20,9] enclosing Blue-Yellow alternations at y=7-8. (Train 1 has single Red [1,1,11,3] enclosing the Blue-Green pattern at y=2, fitting the alternation indirectly.)
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Boundary-constrained alternation. The Red strip's bbox and position define a horizontal section where small elements' colors and positions must alternate (e.g., Green block → Yellow single → Green block), with pixel counts and bboxes adjusting to fit the strip's width without overlap. If irregularity occurs (e.g., wider block), it triggers position shifts within the strip (e.g., train 2 top: Yellow bbox width=2 → width=1, adjacent Green shifts x by 1). This maintains consistent spacing (1-2 units between elements).
   - **Properties Linking Them**: Bbox nesting (small elements' y within Red's y-range, x filling Red's x-span), color sequence (alternation of 2+ colors inside), position (fixed y per strip, x-progressive).
   - **Consistency Note**: Both trains have Red strips enclosing alternating small elements; changes are confined within the strip's bbox. Train 1's single strip fits the pattern at smaller scale.

#### Unknown Connections
- **Merging/Propagation After Splitting**: In cases of splitting (connection #2), adjacent blocks of the same color as the insertion sometimes merge or shift (e.g., train 2 top: after Yellow split, following Green bbox shifts left and merges, adding a new Yellow at end). This occurs in train 2 but not train 1 (no adjacent same-color block), so not consistent across every example—mechanism unknown without further consistent evidence.
- **Vertical Pixel Adjustments**: When blocks have height >1 (e.g., train 2 `bbox y-span=2`, pixels=4-5), post-split pixel counts double (e.g., 5 → 2+2+1? but adjusted to 2+2+2), but exact mapping to vertical filling is unclear and not replicated in train 1 (all height=1)—unknown transformation.
- **Role of Maroon/Light Blue in Broader Contexts**: Maroon appears as both small multi-pixel (e.g., train 2 `pixels=22-27`) and large enclosing (holes=4+), but interactions with Blues/Yellows vary by position (e.g., no consistent splitting in train 2 samples); not replicated in train 1 (no Maroon)—insufficient consistency.

No other interactions (e.g., hole count directly affecting color changes, or silhouette/edge-based movement) are obvious and consistent across both trains. Elements like isolated single Blues or non-enclosed Yellows show no repeated connections.

[2025-10-02 08:45:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both train 1 and train 2) and do not vary or appear inconsistently. I focused only on components with clear, repeated interactions (e.g., via position, color, bbox overlap/proximity, holes, or pixel counts) that affect each other. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone single pixels with no adjacent changes) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation explanation is provided. Where a connection's mechanism cannot be clearly tied to consistent properties without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Large Enclosing Frames and Internal Small Elements**
   - **Components Involved**: Large colored regions with `holes > 0` (typically 1 or more), large bbox spanning the grid edges (e.g., x from 0-12 or 0-28, y from 0-4 or 0-28), and high pixel counts (e.g., 32-193 pixels). Colors: Green, Red, Yellow, Maroon. These act as frames or borders.
     - Examples: Train 1 Green (`holes=1, bbox=[0,0,12,4], pixels=32`), Red (`holes=1, bbox=[1,1,11,3], pixels=24`); Train 2 Red (`holes=1, bbox=[1,1,20,4], pixels=44` and similar horizontal strips), Yellow (`holes=4, bbox=[0,0,21,20], pixels=142`), Maroon (multiple large instances).
   - **Internal Elements**: Small pixelated components (pixels=1-9, `holes=0`) inside the bbox, such as single or multi-pixel blocks of Blue, Green, Yellow, Light Blue.
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Enclosure and boundary definition. The large frames' bbox and position fully contain the internal small elements' bboxes, constraining their y-range (e.g., small elements at fixed y=2 in train 1 within y=0-4 frame; horizontal strips in train 2 at y=1-4, 6-9, etc., containing alternating patterns). Pixel counts of internals remain stable unless affected by other interactions (see below), but their positions are bounded by frame edges/holes. This enclosure is consistent and does not change between input/output in either train.
   - **Properties Linking Them**: Bbox overlap (internals fully nested), holes in frames (indicating cutouts for internals), position (frames define grid limits, internals fill interior rows/columns).
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in both trains; frames do not transform but consistently affect internal positioning.

#### 2. **Multi-Pixel Blocks and Adjacent Single-Pixel Elements of Contrasting Colors**
   - **Components Involved**: Horizontal multi-pixel blocks (`holes=0`, pixels ≥3, bbox width ≥3 in x, often height=1 or 2) of one color, positioned between single-pixel (or narrow vertical) elements (`pixels=1-2`, `holes=0`, bbox size 1x1 or 1x2) of a different color.
     - Block Colors: Green (train 1: `pixels=3, bbox=[7,2,9,2]`), Light Blue (train 2: `pixels=5, bbox=[8,17,10,18]`).
     - Adjacent Single Colors: Blue (flanking Green in train 1), Yellow (flanking Light Blue in train 2).
     - Examples: Train 1 Green block at x=7-9 (y=2) between Blue at x=6 and x=10; Train 2 Light Blue at x=8-10 (y=17-18) between Yellow at x=7 and x=11.
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Splitting and insertion based on proximity. The multi-pixel block's position and pixel count interact with the adjacent singles' color and positions, resulting in the block being divided (pixel count reduced per sub-block) and a single pixel of the adjacent color inserted at the midpoint of the block's x-range. This adjusts bboxes: original block splits into smaller blocks (e.g., pixels=1 each in train 1; pixels=2 each in train 2 for vertical adjustment), with insertion creating a new single-pixel element at the center x.
     - Effect: Pixel counts redistribute (e.g., 3 → 1+1+1 in train 1; 5 → 2+2+2 with insertion in train 2, approximating split). Positions shift slightly for sub-blocks (e.g., original x=7-9 → x=7, x=9 with insert at x=8).
   - **Properties Linking Them**: Position (block flanked by adjacents within 1-4 x-units), color contrast (block color ≠ adjacent color), pixel count (multi ≥3 triggers split), bbox (horizontal alignment in same y-range).
   - **Consistency Note**: Occurs in both trains with identical flanking pattern (same color on both sides of block). Does not apply to vertical-only or isolated singles. No such split in non-flanked blocks.

#### 3. **Red Horizontal Strips and Enclosed Alternating Patterns**
   - **Components Involved**: Large Red strips (`holes=1`, bbox with fixed height ~3 units, wide x-span like [1,1,20,4], pixels ~44), enclosing alternating small elements.
     - Enclosed Elements: Pairs or sequences of small Green/Yellow (train 2 top: Green blocks `pixels=4, bbox width=2` alternating with Yellow `pixels=2, bbox width=1 vertical`) or Blue/Yellow (train 2 middle: singles at y=7-8).
     - Examples: Train 2 Red [1,1,20,4] enclosing Green-Yellow-Green-... at y=2-3; Red [1,6,20,9] enclosing Blue-Yellow alternations at y=7-8. (Train 1 has single Red [1,1,11,3] enclosing the Blue-Green pattern at y=2, fitting the alternation indirectly.)
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Boundary-constrained alternation. The Red strip's bbox and position define a horizontal section where small elements' colors and positions must alternate (e.g., Green block → Yellow single → Green block), with pixel counts and bboxes adjusting to fit the strip's width without overlap. If irregularity occurs (e.g., wider block), it triggers position shifts within the strip (e.g., train 2 top: Yellow bbox width=2 → width=1, adjacent Green shifts x by 1). This maintains consistent spacing (1-2 units between elements).
   - **Properties Linking Them**: Bbox nesting (small elements' y within Red's y-range, x filling Red's x-span), color sequence (alternation of 2+ colors inside), position (fixed y per strip, x-progressive).
   - **Consistency Note**: Both trains have Red strips enclosing alternating small elements; changes are confined within the strip's bbox. Train 1's single strip fits the pattern at smaller scale.

#### Unknown Connections
- **Merging/Propagation After Splitting**: In cases of splitting (connection #2), adjacent blocks of the same color as the insertion sometimes merge or shift (e.g., train 2 top: after Yellow split, following Green bbox shifts left and merges, adding a new Yellow at end). This occurs in train 2 but not train 1 (no adjacent same-color block), so not consistent across every example—mechanism unknown without further consistent evidence.
- **Vertical Pixel Adjustments**: When blocks have height >1 (e.g., train 2 `bbox y-span=2`, pixels=4-5), post-split pixel counts double (e.g., 5 → 2+2+1? but adjusted to 2+2+2), but exact mapping to vertical filling is unclear and not replicated in train 1 (all height=1)—unknown transformation.
- **Role of Maroon/Light Blue in Broader Contexts**: Maroon appears as both small multi-pixel (e.g., train 2 `pixels=22-27`) and large enclosing (holes=4+), but interactions with Blues/Yellows vary by position (e.g., no consistent splitting in train 2 samples); not replicated in train 1 (no Maroon)—insufficient consistency.

No other interactions (e.g., hole count directly affecting color changes, or silhouette/edge-based movement) are obvious and consistent across both trains. Elements like isolated single Blues or non-enclosed Yellows show no repeated connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 09:05:16] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def split_long_runs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(len(h)):
        c = 0
        n = len(h[r])
        while c < n:
            start = c
            color = h[r][c]
            while c < n and h[r][c] == color:
                c += 1
            l = c - start
            if l >= 3:
                left = start - 1
                right = c
                if left >= 0 and right < n and h[r][left] == h[r][right] and h[r][left] != color:
                    mid = start + l // 2
                    h[r][mid] = h[r][left]
    return h

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return split_long_runs(g)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

[2025-10-02 09:07:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (representing colors or filled cells) bordered by a consistent outer number (e.g., 3 or 4), with an inner frame of 2's and central regions filled with specific repeating patterns for different numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 8, 9), likely to create structured visual motifs like dashed lines, paired blocks, or grouped segments without excessive long runs in certain areas. The goal is to transform an input grid (presumably with uniform or long runs in inner regions) into this patterned output, processing horizontally and vertically to achieve symmetry and specific group lengths separated by the border color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns vary by number and row position: e.g., 2's form long continuous horizontal runs in frame rows (length >3, no splitting); 3's form pairs (length 2) separated by single border (4); 1's form staggered singletons separated by border (4), alternating starting with 1 or 4 per row for a diagonal/checker effect; 8's form mostly triples (length 3) separated by single border (4), but with variations at edges (e.g., initial single in one row, terminal pair in another); 9's form singles separated by border (4), consistent across rows.
 * No vertical processing in the attempt; patterns require 2D consideration, as adjacent rows are offset or mirrored (e.g., 1's stagger, 8's edge groups differ).
 * Long runs (>=3) are preserved for some numbers (2's) but split into fixed small groups for others (1's,3's,8's,9's), using border color as separators; splitting is not arbitrary but follows number-specific rules (e.g., group size 1 for 1/9, 2 for 3, 3 for 8).
 * Borders and frames must remain unchanged; insertions only in inner regions, avoiding changes to 2's frame or outer edges.
 * Subtle: Edge cases near the inner 2's (positions 1 and 20 in example 2) act as partial separators, influencing terminal group sizes (e.g., 8's end with 2 instead of 4 in some spots); no changes if run length <3 (e.g., pairs or singles untouched).
 * Overall grid symmetry: horizontal mirroring, vertical repetition in blocks (e.g., two rows per pattern type), all-inner regions bounded by 2's frame.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only horizontal row processing attempted, ignoring vertical/2D patterns; no detection of region types (e.g., by number or position); assumes all long runs need splitting, but some (2's) do not; no handling for varying group sizes per number.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful functions from the previous attempt; the provided `split_long_runs` is broken and unhelpful for the puzzle, as it arbitrarily splits any run >=3 using bordering colors (introducing unwanted interruptions in continuous 2's and creating irregular groups for 8's/3's instead of fixed sizes), and ignores 2D structure/ number-specific rules—do not use it in future attempts.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt focused solely on horizontal row processing to split runs >=3 by overwriting the middle cell with the matching left/right border color if they differ from the run color.
 * Missed preserving long continuous runs for frame colors like 2's; incorrectly inserted border color (3) into the middle of 2's runs in training 1, creating artificial splits (e.g., generated row 1/3: interrupting 3 at position 6, resulting in two shorter 2's runs instead of one long run of 11 2's from positions 1-11).
 * In training 2, correctly left untouched patterns with no runs >=3 (e.g., 1's alternating singles, most 9's singles/pairs, resulting in matching output for rows 7,8,17,18,20), but incorrectly split regions with longer runs: for 3's rows (2/3), changed near-end sequence from expected 4,3,3,4 to 4,4,3,3 (positions 16-19), breaking the consistent pair-of-3's pattern for unknown reason (possibly overzealous border matching on adjacent short runs or input assumption error); for 8's rows (12/13), heavily fragmented expected triple groups into irregular singles/doubles (e.g., row 12 generated: 8,4,4,8,8,4,8,4,... instead of 8,4,8,8,8,4,...; row 13 generated: 8,8,4,4,8,4,... instead of 8,8,8,4,...), creating too many separators and mismatched group sizes.
 * No extraction of objects/regions attempted; would need functions to identify inner blocks by number/color, determine group size rules (e.g., 1 for 1/9, 2 for 3, 3 for 8), and apply 2D staggering.
 * Function `split_long_runs` is incorrect and not relevant (over-splits, ignores number-specific rules and vertical alignment—do not reuse).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears chaotic and over-processed, with irregular insertions of 2's (e.g., multiple 2,2 pairs in rows 3,4,5,7,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,17,19,20,22,23,24,25 that disrupt expected structured groups) and mismatched placements of 4's/9's/1's/3's/8's, suggesting the program applied arbitrary splits across a large grid with mixed numbers, breaking potential patterns into short, inconsistent runs instead of number-specific groups.
 * For example, row 2 has scattered 3's with 8's borders but includes unexpected 1,4 placements mid-row (e.g., positions around 9-10: 1, then later 4,4), which doesn't align with training patterns (e.g., no mixing of 1/4 into 3's blocks); row 4 has 2,2 inserted amid 3's/8's, and 4,4 pairs that may over-split; rows with 9's (e.g., row 24?) show 9,9 doubles instead of singles separated by 8 (border), similar to the training 2 error for 9's end; overall, lacks the block-wise structure (e.g., no clear staggered 1's or triple 8's), with too many 2's suggesting failed frame preservation or erroneous merging/splitting.
 * The output is different from what is expected based on training rules: it has excessive short runs and cross-contamination of numbers (e.g., 2's intruding into inner patterns, unknown why but likely from border-matching logic misfiring on complex input); to handle the test input (a larger 29-column grid with 8 borders, 3 frame?, mixed inner 1-9), update the program to first detect regions by row/column blocks and number type, then apply fixed group sizes (e.g., insert border separators every N cells where N= number value?), and incorporate vertical shifting for staggered rows.
