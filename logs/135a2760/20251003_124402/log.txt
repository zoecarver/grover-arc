=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 12:44:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 13:01:52] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # The core function from the attempt: copies grid, identifies s as g[0][0], processes each row for eligibility,
    # detects single inner color c (skipping 2), determines period and pattern, finds best phase via match count,
    # and overwrites inner range with the phased pattern. Handles side color narrowing and skips invalid rows.
    # This is the primary solver; no separate types or extraction functions were used, but it implicitly "extracts"
    # per-row patterns via color sets and phase matching.
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return new_g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])

    for r in range(h):
        row = new_g[r]
        if row[0] != s or row[w - 1] != s:

        if row[1] == row[w - 2] and row[1] != s:
            side = row[1]
            istart = 2
            iend = w - 3

            continue
        c = next(iter(colors))
        if c == 2:
            continue
        period = period_dict.get(c, 2)
        pattern = [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
        best_matches = -1
        best_phase = 0
        for phase in range(period):
            matches = 0
            for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
            if matches > best_matches:
                best_matches = matches
                best_phase = phase
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            idx = (jj - istart + best_phase) % period
            new_g[r][jj] = pattern[idx]
    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 13:16:38] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p

def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern

def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 13:18:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

[2025-10-03 13:18:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # The core function from the attempt: copies grid, identifies s as g[0][0], processes each row for eligibility,
    # detects single inner color c (skipping 2), determines period and pattern, finds best phase via match count,
    # and overwrites inner range with the phased pattern. Handles side color narrowing and skips invalid rows.
    # This is the primary solver; no separate types or extraction functions were used, but it implicitly "extracts"
    # per-row patterns via color sets and phase matching.

            new_g[r][jj] = pattern[idx]
    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

[2025-10-03 13:39:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # The core function from the attempt: copies grid, identifies s as g[0][0], processes each row for eligibility,
    # detects single inner color c (skipping 2), determines period and pattern, finds best phase via match count,
    # and overwrites inner range with the phased pattern. Handles side color narrowing and skips invalid rows.
    # This is the primary solver; no separate types or extraction functions were used, but it implicitly "extracts"
    # per-row patterns via color sets and phase matching.
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]

        row = new_g[r]
        if row[0] != s or row[w - 1] != s:

            idx = (jj - istart + best_phase) % period
            new_g[r][jj] = pattern[idx]
    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

[2025-10-03 13:56:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

            best_matches = m
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase, best_matches
```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

[2025-10-03 13:56:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:10:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; simple and reliable if grid is consistent.)

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Checks for bordered rows; essential for identifying candidates, but misses partial borders.)

```python
def get_inner_range(row: List[int], s: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    w = len(row)
    if w < 3:
        return 1, 0
    if row[1] == 2 and row[w - 2] == 2:
        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Core for identifying the pattern color c; strict majority threshold is a good subtlety to avoid noise, using collections.Counter.)

```python
def get_period(c: int) -> int:
    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

[2025-10-03 14:11:17] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on analysis of the two train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both 1 and 2). I focused solely on elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation), ignoring isolated or irrelevant elements (e.g., standalone single-pixel components with no adjacent effects, or components outside the inner bars that do not change). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Where an interaction's exact mechanism cannot be explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown. Only consistent behaviors across both examples are included; inconsistent or one-off changes (e.g., specific pixel additions in one example but not the other) are excluded.

- **Large frame components (holes > 0) and their preservation**: Components with holes >=1 (e.g., Green holes=1, Red holes=1, Yellow holes=4 in train 2) consistently remain unchanged in color, holes count, bbox, and pixels from input to output. These do not interact with small components but are affected by their enclosing position (they bound the overall composition without alteration, suggesting positional enclosure as a static interaction that prevents transformation of internal elements).
  
- **Small bar components (holes=0) position -> color transformation in adjacent blocks**: Positions of adjacent small components (holes=0, located within red inner bars at consistent y-levels like y=2 or equivalent rows) of the same color consistently trigger color changes or insertions of an alternating color (e.g., Green blocks adjacent to Blue/Yellow in train 1 lead to Blue insertion; Yellow blocks adjacent to Green in train 2 lead to Green insertion or flip). This interaction affects only blocks spanning >=2 units in x-direction; single-unit components are unaffected. Exact rule for insertion/flip position is unknown.

- **Small bar components bbox width -> splitting/merging with color alternation**: When small components (holes=0) in the inner red bars have bbox width >=2 (indicating consecutive same-color units), they consistently interact by splitting (train 1: Green width=3 at x=7-9 splits into width=1 units with inserted alternating color) or partial remapping (train 2: Yellow width=2 at x=16-17 remapped with adjacent Green to alternate pattern). This preserves total pixels in the affected section but redistributes them into smaller bbox widths (<=2). Merging occurs only if adjacent same-color (train 2: separate Maroon components at y=12 merge into single bbox), but exact pixel adjustment post-merge is unknown.

- **Color palette consistency in bar interactions -> no new colors introduced**: Interactions between small bar components (holes=0, within red enclosures) consistently reuse only existing colors from the input palette (e.g., Blue-Green alternation in train 1; Green-Yellow in train 2 top bar; no introduction of new colors like Purple despite high-level mention). This suggests color property constrains transformations, limiting effects to palette members based on initial adjacent colors.

- **Red inner bar position -> bounding interaction with small components**: The Red components (holes=1, horizontal bbox like [1,1,11,3] in train 1 or [1,1,20,4] in train 2) consistently enclose and bound the positions of interacting small components (holes=0) without changing themselves. This positional enclosure affects small components by limiting transformation scope (changes occur only inside Red bbox; no spillover outside).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., hole count=0 components outside bars show no reliable effects; vertical stacks or gradients in train 2 do not consistently transform across examples; silhouette/edge properties like bbox height do not reliably affect movement or color in both). Elements like isolated Light Blue or Maroon singles in non-bar areas have no observed connections.

[2025-10-03 14:13:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on analysis of the two train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both 1 and 2). I focused solely on elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation), ignoring isolated or irrelevant elements (e.g., standalone single-pixel components with no adjacent effects, or components outside the inner bars that do not change). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Where an interaction's exact mechanism cannot be explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown. Only consistent behaviors across both examples are included; inconsistent or one-off changes (e.g., specific pixel additions in one example but not the other) are excluded.

- **Large frame components (holes > 0) and their preservation**: Components with holes >=1 (e.g., Green holes=1, Red holes=1, Yellow holes=4 in train 2) consistently remain unchanged in color, holes count, bbox, and pixels from input to output. These do not interact with small components but are affected by their enclosing position (they bound the overall composition without alteration, suggesting positional enclosure as a static interaction that prevents transformation of internal elements).
  
- **Small bar components (holes=0) position -> color transformation in adjacent blocks**: Positions of adjacent small components (holes=0, located within red inner bars at consistent y-levels like y=2 or equivalent rows) of the same color consistently trigger color changes or insertions of an alternating color (e.g., Green blocks adjacent to Blue/Yellow in train 1 lead to Blue insertion; Yellow blocks adjacent to Green in train 2 lead to Green insertion or flip). This interaction affects only blocks spanning >=2 units in x-direction; single-unit components are unaffected. Exact rule for insertion/flip position is unknown.

- **Small bar components bbox width -> splitting/merging with color alternation**: When small components (holes=0) in the inner red bars have bbox width >=2 (indicating consecutive same-color units), they consistently interact by splitting (train 1: Green width=3 at x=7-9 splits into width=1 units with inserted alternating color) or partial remapping (train 2: Yellow width=2 at x=16-17 remapped with adjacent Green to alternate pattern). This preserves total pixels in the affected section but redistributes them into smaller bbox widths (<=2). Merging occurs only if adjacent same-color (train 2: separate Maroon components at y=12 merge into single bbox), but exact pixel adjustment post-merge is unknown.

- **Color palette consistency in bar interactions -> no new colors introduced**: Interactions between small bar components (holes=0, within red enclosures) consistently reuse only existing colors from the input palette (e.g., Blue-Green alternation in train 1; Green-Yellow in train 2 top bar; no introduction of new colors like Purple despite high-level mention). This suggests color property constrains transformations, limiting effects to palette members based on initial adjacent colors.

- **Red inner bar position -> bounding interaction with small components**: The Red components (holes=1, horizontal bbox like [1,1,11,3] in train 1 or [1,1,20,4] in train 2) consistently enclose and bound the positions of interacting small components (holes=0) without changing themselves. This positional enclosure affects small components by limiting transformation scope (changes occur only inside Red bbox; no spillover outside).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., hole count=0 components outside bars show no reliable effects; vertical stacks or gradients in train 2 do not consistently transform across examples; silhouette/edge properties like bbox height do not reliably affect movement or color in both). Elements like isolated Light Blue or Maroon singles in non-bar areas have no observed connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:25:07] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
import math

# Wall detection: Identifies full-background columns including edges
def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == f for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```

```python
# Pattern fitting: For a sub-row, finds best periodic pattern based on dominant c and g_val
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> List[int]:
    u = g_val + 1
    best_dist = math.inf
    best_preserved = -1
    best_shift = math.inf
    best_pattern = None
    for shift in range(u):
        pattern = [0] * len(subinner)
        for ii in range(len(subinner)):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(len(subinner)))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(len(subinner)) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

[2025-10-03 14:25:20] Response:
- **Outer frames**: Large rectangular borders primarily in green, enclosing all internal elements; in the complex panel layout, borders vary by panel (green for first and second, yellow for third, blue for fourth with purple accents).
- **Inner frames**: Medium rectangular borders in red for simple examples, containing segmented content; in complex panels, absent or implied by pixel stacking.
- **Segmented bars (simple examples)**: Horizontal arrangements of short blue rectangles (3 in first image, 4 in second) separated by thin green spacers, centered within the red inner frame on a green background, suggesting progression or addition of elements.
- **Vertical panels (complex puzzle)**: Four tall, side-by-side columns within an overarching green and purple bordered structure:
  - First panel: Solid vertical stack of red pixel blocks (approximately 5 high), evoking a uniform bar or pillar.
  - Second panel: Wavy or serpentine blue pixel line (curved S-like path) against a darker (purple-tinted) background.
  - Third panel: Zigzag yellow pixel pattern (Z or lightning shape) in a structured grid.
  - Fourth panel: Blocky blue pixel forms (L or stepped shapes with protrusions) against purple.
- **Backgrounds and spacers**: Consistent green fills for separations and outer areas in simple examples; varied neutral or colored fills (e.g., purple, green) in complex panels to highlight pixel art.
- **Pixel art style**: All elements rendered in a blocky, grid-based aesthetic, with colors limited to primary hues (green, red, blue, yellow, purple) for contrast and pattern recognition.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 14:25:20] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Outer frames**: Large rectangular borders primarily in green, enclosing all internal elements; in the complex panel layout, borders vary by panel (green for first and second, yellow for third, blue for fourth with purple accents).
- **Inner frames**: Medium rectangular borders in red for simple examples, containing segmented content; in complex panels, absent or implied by pixel stacking.
- **Segmented bars (simple examples)**: Horizontal arrangements of short blue rectangles (3 in first image, 4 in second) separated by thin green spacers, centered within the red inner frame on a green background, suggesting progression or addition of elements.
- **Vertical panels (complex puzzle)**: Four tall, side-by-side columns within an overarching green and purple bordered structure:
  - First panel: Solid vertical stack of red pixel blocks (approximately 5 high), evoking a uniform bar or pillar.
  - Second panel: Wavy or serpentine blue pixel line (curved S-like path) against a darker (purple-tinted) background.
  - Third panel: Zigzag yellow pixel pattern (Z or lightning shape) in a structured grid.
  - Fourth panel: Blocky blue pixel forms (L or stepped shapes with protrusions) against purple.
- **Backgrounds and spacers**: Consistent green fills for separations and outer areas in simple examples; varied neutral or colored fills (e.g., purple, green) in complex panels to highlight pixel art.
- **Pixel art style**: All elements rendered in a blocky, grid-based aesthetic, with colors limited to primary hues (green, red, blue, yellow, purple) for contrast and pattern recognition.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (input 1/output 1 and input 2/output 2), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear and interact in **every** example (both trains). I ignored any non-consistent elements (e.g., maroon or light blue appear only in train 2; outer frame color varies as green/yellow but interaction type is consistent; vertical vs. horizontal layouts differ but enclosure interaction holds). No high-level interpretation or solution is provided. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel count adjustments in some splits) are noted as such. Connections are described as property A -> effect on property B, where evident from bbox, color, holes, or pixel changes.

1. **Red inner frame (holes=1, consistent bbox structure [1,start_y,width,end_y], pixels ~20-44) encloses alternating color blocks**:  
   - The red frame's bbox boundaries directly contain all small blue/green (train 1) or blue/yellow/green/yellow (train 2) blocks at specific y-levels (e.g., y=2 in train 1; y=2-3,7-8 in train 2).  
   - Interaction: Frame's holes=1 property indicates enclosure of internal content; content blocks do not overlap or escape the frame's x/y bounds in either input/output. No transformation of frame itself, but it consistently segments rows for independent block interactions.

2. **Green outer frame (holes=1 in train 1; analogous yellow outer with holes>1 in train 2) encloses red inner frame(s)**:  
   - Outer bbox ([0,0,width,height] style) fully surrounds red inner frame(s), with holes=1 (train 1) or holes=4 (train 2) correlating to number of enclosed red frames (1 in train 1, 4 in train 2).  
   - Interaction: Outer's position (full canvas) -> red frame positioning (nested inside); no color change, but pixel count of outer remains stable while internal transformations occur. Consistent across both as hierarchical enclosure (outer -> inner).

3. **Position (bbox y-coordinate) -> alternating color block creation/splitting**:  
   - Blocks at same y-level (e.g., y=2 in train 1; y=2 and y=7-8 in train 2) form horizontal sequences of alternating colors (blue/green in train 1; blue/yellow or green/yellow in train 2).  
   - Interaction: Adjacent blocks at same y with multi-pixel bbox width (>1 in x-direction) trigger splitting in output; e.g., green bbox width=3 at y=2 (train 1) -> split into width=1 segments; blue bbox width=3 at y=7-8 (train 2) -> split into width=1 segments. Consistent insertion of alternating color (e.g., position-based neighbor color) between split parts. Pixel count preserved or minimally adjusted (unknown exact rule for +1 pixel in train 2 blue split).

4. **Color (blue or green/yellow) + pixel count (>1) -> insertion of alternating color**:  
   - Multi-pixel blocks (pixels>1, holes=0) of one color in an alternating sequence (e.g., blue-green in train 1; blue-yellow in train 2 y=7-8) interact with neighboring opposite color.  
   - Interaction: Block color -> inserts opposite color block (e.g., multi-green -> inserts blue in train 1; multi-blue -> inserts yellow in train 2). Results in more single-pixel (pixels=1 or 2) blocks of alternating colors. Consistent in both examples for horizontal rows; no vertical interaction observed. Unknown: Why some splits preserve pixels exactly vs. minor increase.

5. **Bbox position (x-adjacent to multi-pixel block) -> transformation of spacer block**:  
   - Single-pixel blocks (e.g., blue at x=6/10 in train 1; yellow at x=7/11 in train 2) adjacent to multi-pixel spacers (green width=3 in train 1; blue width=3 in train 2) remain unchanged but define the alternating pattern.  
   - Interaction: Adjacent position -> triggers split of the multi-pixel block into alternating segments matching the sequence (e.g., x=6 blue + x=7-9 green -> x=6 blue + x=7 green + x=8 blue + x=9 green in train 1). Consistent extension of pattern length by 1 block in both.

No other connections (e.g., hole count changes, vertical position effects, or merges) are consistent across every example, as they appear only in train 2. Elements like small red squares or light blue do not interact consistently in train 1 (absent). No forced connections; test input not used for consistency check per instructions.

[2025-10-03 14:26:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (input 1/output 1 and input 2/output 2), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear and interact in **every** example (both trains). I ignored any non-consistent elements (e.g., maroon or light blue appear only in train 2; outer frame color varies as green/yellow but interaction type is consistent; vertical vs. horizontal layouts differ but enclosure interaction holds). No high-level interpretation or solution is provided. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel count adjustments in some splits) are noted as such. Connections are described as property A -> effect on property B, where evident from bbox, color, holes, or pixel changes.

1. **Red inner frame (holes=1, consistent bbox structure [1,start_y,width,end_y], pixels ~20-44) encloses alternating color blocks**:  
   - The red frame's bbox boundaries directly contain all small blue/green (train 1) or blue/yellow/green/yellow (train 2) blocks at specific y-levels (e.g., y=2 in train 1; y=2-3,7-8 in train 2).  
   - Interaction: Frame's holes=1 property indicates enclosure of internal content; content blocks do not overlap or escape the frame's x/y bounds in either input/output. No transformation of frame itself, but it consistently segments rows for independent block interactions.

2. **Green outer frame (holes=1 in train 1; analogous yellow outer with holes>1 in train 2) encloses red inner frame(s)**:  
   - Outer bbox ([0,0,width,height] style) fully surrounds red inner frame(s), with holes=1 (train 1) or holes=4 (train 2) correlating to number of enclosed red frames (1 in train 1, 4 in train 2).  
   - Interaction: Outer's position (full canvas) -> red frame positioning (nested inside); no color change, but pixel count of outer remains stable while internal transformations occur. Consistent across both as hierarchical enclosure (outer -> inner).

3. **Position (bbox y-coordinate) -> alternating color block creation/splitting**:  
   - Blocks at same y-level (e.g., y=2 in train 1; y=2 and y=7-8 in train 2) form horizontal sequences of alternating colors (blue/green in train 1; blue/yellow or green/yellow in train 2).  
   - Interaction: Adjacent blocks at same y with multi-pixel bbox width (>1 in x-direction) trigger splitting in output; e.g., green bbox width=3 at y=2 (train 1) -> split into width=1 segments; blue bbox width=3 at y=7-8 (train 2) -> split into width=1 segments. Consistent insertion of alternating color (e.g., position-based neighbor color) between split parts. Pixel count preserved or minimally adjusted (unknown exact rule for +1 pixel in train 2 blue split).

4. **Color (blue or green/yellow) + pixel count (>1) -> insertion of alternating color**:  
   - Multi-pixel blocks (pixels>1, holes=0) of one color in an alternating sequence (e.g., blue-green in train 1; blue-yellow in train 2 y=7-8) interact with neighboring opposite color.  
   - Interaction: Block color -> inserts opposite color block (e.g., multi-green -> inserts blue in train 1; multi-blue -> inserts yellow in train 2). Results in more single-pixel (pixels=1 or 2) blocks of alternating colors. Consistent in both examples for horizontal rows; no vertical interaction observed. Unknown: Why some splits preserve pixels exactly vs. minor increase.

5. **Bbox position (x-adjacent to multi-pixel block) -> transformation of spacer block**:  
   - Single-pixel blocks (e.g., blue at x=6/10 in train 1; yellow at x=7/11 in train 2) adjacent to multi-pixel spacers (green width=3 in train 1; blue width=3 in train 2) remain unchanged but define the alternating pattern.  
   - Interaction: Adjacent position -> triggers split of the multi-pixel block into alternating segments matching the sequence (e.g., x=6 blue + x=7-9 green -> x=6 blue + x=7 green + x=8 blue + x=9 green in train 1). Consistent extension of pattern length by 1 block in both.

No other connections (e.g., hole count changes, vertical position effects, or merges) are consistent across every example, as they appear only in train 2. Elements like small red squares or light blue do not interact consistently in train 1 (absent). No forced connections; test input not used for consistency check per instructions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

[2025-10-03 14:30:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Outer frame**: Green rectangular border enclosing the entire composition in all images.
- **Inner border**: Red rectangular frame within the green outer frame, containing internal elements (absent or varied in the third image's panels).
- **Internal dividers**: Horizontal green strips or spaces separating blue elements in the first two images; vertical green borders dividing panels in the third image.
- **Blue elements**: Small square or rectangular blue shapes arranged in rows (three in first image, four in second); wavy or angular blue lines and shapes in the third image's second and fourth panels.
- **Red elements**: Stacked small red squares in the third image's first panel; forms the inner border in first two images.
- **Yellow elements**: Angular, zigzag yellow shapes resembling letters or symbols (e.g., "N" or "Z" patterns) in the third image's third panel.
- **Purple elements**: Vertical purple border or background in the third image's fourth panel, with blue accents.
- **Overall structure**: Horizontal layout in first two images (simple grid-like pattern); vertical multi-panel layout in third image (four side-by-side sections with varied internal pixel-art motifs).

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements or properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** example (both train 1 and train 2). I focused only on low-level, direct interactions (e.g., how one property or component directly affects or is affected by another via position, color flip, or splitting). I ignored high-level patterns, irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated singles with no adjacent blocks), inconsistent interactions (e.g., specific block sizes like "2-wide only" in train 2 top row, which is not in train 1), and anything requiring puzzle-solving (e.g., semantic meaning of shapes or full transformations). If an interaction cannot be explained without assuming a solution (e.g., why a specific color is "opposite"), it is called out as unknown.

#### Consistent Interactions Across All Examples:
1. **Horizontal position (x-coordinate in a row) interacts with color of adjacent components to cause splitting or flipping**:
   - When a multi-pixel horizontal block (pixels >1, same color, adjacent in x at fixed y) is next to a single-pixel component of a different color, the block splits, and an internal pixel in the block flips color to match the adjacent component's color.
   - Example from train 1: Green block [7,2,9,2] pixels=3 (at y=2) is adjacent to Blue [6,2,6,2] pixels=1 (left) and Blue [10,2,10,2] pixels=1 (right); middle pixel at x=8 flips to Blue, splitting Green into [7,2,7,2] and [9,2,9,2].
   - Example from train 2: Blue block [8,7,10,8] pixels=4 (spans y=7-8, horizontal at y=7 x=8-10) is adjacent to Yellow [7,7,7,7] pixels=1 (left at y=7) and Yellow [11,7,11,7] pixels=1 (right at y=7); internal pixel at x=9 (y=7) flips to Yellow, splitting Blue into [8,7,8,7] and [10,7,10,7].
   - Effect: Maintains single-pixel separation; total pixels unchanged (one pixel flipped, no addition/removal). Consistent in both (happens in internal rows/sections).

2. **Color of a block interacts with neighboring block's color to determine flip target (unknown specific rule)**:
   - A pixel in a multi-pixel block flips to the color of the immediate adjacent block (left or right) when splitting occurs.
   - Example from train 1: Green block flips internal pixel to Blue (neighbor color).
   - Example from train 2: Blue block at y=7 flips internal to Yellow (neighbor color); Yellow block [16,2,17,3] pixels=4 adjacent to Green [18,2,19,3] pixels=4 flips edge pixel (x=17) to Green, and vice versa (x=19 Green flips to Yellow).
   - Effect: Creates new single-pixel components of the neighbor's color; holes and bbox adjust to singles (holes=0, pixels=1 or 2 for height>1). The exact choice of which pixel flips (e.g., middle vs. edge) is unknown without solving, but the flip to neighbor color is consistent.

3. **Bbox overlap or adjacency in x (horizontal) interacts with holes property to prevent merging**:
   - Components with overlapping or adjacent bbox in x (same y range) but different colors do not merge, even if pixels suggest proximity; instead, they trigger splitting/flipping in the larger one.
   - Example from train 1: No overlap, but adjacent bbox ([6,2,6,2] Blue and [7,2,9,2] Green) triggers split without changing holes (remains 0 for small components).
   - Example from train 2: Yellow [16,2,17,3] bbox adjacent/overlaps edge with Green [18,2,19,3] bbox (x=17-18 proximity at y=2-3); triggers flip without creating holes in new components (all holes=0 post-split).
   - Effect: Preserves separate components; big frames (e.g., Red inner with holes=1) are unaffected. Consistent isolation of internal small components from frames.

4. **Pixels count (>1 horizontal) interacts with position to create new components**:
   - Multi-pixel horizontal runs (bbox width >1, same y) adjacent to singles generate 1-2 new single-pixel components via flip/split, adjusting bbox to minimal size.
   - Example from train 1: 3-pixel Green run at x=7-9 (y=2) creates 2 new components (Blue [8,2,8,2] pixels=1, Green [9,2,9,2] pixels=1) from original 1 component.
   - Example from train 2: 2-wide Yellow run at x=16-17 (y=2-3, pixels=4 vertical) adjacent to Green creates 2 new components (Green [17,2,18,3] pixels=4 adjusted, Yellow [19,2,19,3] pixels=2).
   - Effect: Increases number of listed components (from 1 to 3+); pixels redistributed without net change. Consistent for internal rows only (frames exempt).

#### Elements with No Consistent Interaction (Excluded):
- Vertical position (y-coordinate): Affects bbox height in train 2 multi-row (e.g., p=2 for height=2), but train 1 is single-row (no y variation), so inconsistent.
- Holes >0: Only in frames (Green/Red/Yellow big components); no interaction with internals in both examples (unchanged, no splitting).
- Specific colors beyond neighbors (e.g., Light Blue or Maroon in train 2 only; no equivalent in train 1).
- Overall structure (e.g., outer frames): Unchanged in both, but no direct effect on internals (no splitting triggered by them).
- Non-adjacent or isolated singles (e.g., standalone Blue pixels=1): No change or interaction in either example.

#### Notes on Unknowns:
- The choice of "opposite" color for flips is always the neighbor's color in both examples, but why that neighbor (left vs. right, or both) is unknown (e.g., in train 2 end row, why flip to create Y1 G2 Y1 specifically cannot be explained without assuming a target pattern).
- No consistent interaction for vertical blocks (e.g., tall components spanning multiple y in train 2; train 1 has none).
- For the test input 1, similar horizontal multi-pixel blocks exist (e.g., Maroon [18,2,19,2] pixels=2 adjacent to Yellow [16,2,19,13]; Maroon [10,2,12,4] pixels=6 with internal Blue [10,3,10,3] adjacent), suggesting potential splitting/flips like above, but exact transformation is unknown without solving the multi-panel structure. No forced connections (e.g., no evidence of Yellow-Maroon flip consistent across all examples, as train 1 lacks them).

[2025-10-03 14:32:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements or properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** example (both train 1 and train 2). I focused only on low-level, direct interactions (e.g., how one property or component directly affects or is affected by another via position, color flip, or splitting). I ignored high-level patterns, irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated singles with no adjacent blocks), inconsistent interactions (e.g., specific block sizes like "2-wide only" in train 2 top row, which is not in train 1), and anything requiring puzzle-solving (e.g., semantic meaning of shapes or full transformations). If an interaction cannot be explained without assuming a solution (e.g., why a specific color is "opposite"), it is called out as unknown.

#### Consistent Interactions Across All Examples:
1. **Horizontal position (x-coordinate in a row) interacts with color of adjacent components to cause splitting or flipping**:
   - When a multi-pixel horizontal block (pixels >1, same color, adjacent in x at fixed y) is next to a single-pixel component of a different color, the block splits, and an internal pixel in the block flips color to match the adjacent component's color.
   - Example from train 1: Green block [7,2,9,2] pixels=3 (at y=2) is adjacent to Blue [6,2,6,2] pixels=1 (left) and Blue [10,2,10,2] pixels=1 (right); middle pixel at x=8 flips to Blue, splitting Green into [7,2,7,2] and [9,2,9,2].
   - Example from train 2: Blue block [8,7,10,8] pixels=4 (spans y=7-8, horizontal at y=7 x=8-10) is adjacent to Yellow [7,7,7,7] pixels=1 (left at y=7) and Yellow [11,7,11,7] pixels=1 (right at y=7); internal pixel at x=9 (y=7) flips to Yellow, splitting Blue into [8,7,8,7] and [10,7,10,7].
   - Effect: Maintains single-pixel separation; total pixels unchanged (one pixel flipped, no addition/removal). Consistent in both (happens in internal rows/sections).

2. **Color of a block interacts with neighboring block's color to determine flip target (unknown specific rule)**:
   - A pixel in a multi-pixel block flips to the color of the immediate adjacent block (left or right) when splitting occurs.
   - Example from train 1: Green block flips internal pixel to Blue (neighbor color).
   - Example from train 2: Blue block at y=7 flips internal to Yellow (neighbor color); Yellow block [16,2,17,3] pixels=4 adjacent to Green [18,2,19,3] pixels=4 flips edge pixel (x=17) to Green, and vice versa (x=19 Green flips to Yellow).
   - Effect: Creates new single-pixel components of the neighbor's color; holes and bbox adjust to singles (holes=0, pixels=1 or 2 for height>1). The exact choice of which pixel flips (e.g., middle vs. edge) is unknown without solving, but the flip to neighbor color is consistent.

3. **Bbox overlap or adjacency in x (horizontal) interacts with holes property to prevent merging**:
   - Components with overlapping or adjacent bbox in x (same y range) but different colors do not merge, even if pixels suggest proximity; instead, they trigger splitting/flipping in the larger one.
   - Example from train 1: No overlap, but adjacent bbox ([6,2,6,2] Blue and [7,2,9,2] Green) triggers split without changing holes (remains 0 for small components).
   - Example from train 2: Yellow [16,2,17,3] bbox adjacent/overlaps edge with Green [18,2,19,3] bbox (x=17-18 proximity at y=2-3); triggers flip without creating holes in new components (all holes=0 post-split).
   - Effect: Preserves separate components; big frames (e.g., Red inner with holes=1) are unaffected. Consistent isolation of internal small components from frames.

4. **Pixels count (>1 horizontal) interacts with position to create new components**:
   - Multi-pixel horizontal runs (bbox width >1, same y) adjacent to singles generate 1-2 new single-pixel components via flip/split, adjusting bbox to minimal size.
   - Example from train 1: 3-pixel Green run at x=7-9 (y=2) creates 2 new components (Blue [8,2,8,2] pixels=1, Green [9,2,9,2] pixels=1) from original 1 component.
   - Example from train 2: 2-wide Yellow run at x=16-17 (y=2-3, pixels=4 vertical) adjacent to Green creates 2 new components (Green [17,2,18,3] pixels=4 adjusted, Yellow [19,2,19,3] pixels=2).
   - Effect: Increases number of listed components (from 1 to 3+); pixels redistributed without net change. Consistent for internal rows only (frames exempt).

#### Elements with No Consistent Interaction (Excluded):
- Vertical position (y-coordinate): Affects bbox height in train 2 multi-row (e.g., p=2 for height=2), but train 1 is single-row (no y variation), so inconsistent.
- Holes >0: Only in frames (Green/Red/Yellow big components); no interaction with internals in both examples (unchanged, no splitting).
- Specific colors beyond neighbors (e.g., Light Blue or Maroon in train 2 only; no equivalent in train 1).
- Overall structure (e.g., outer frames): Unchanged in both, but no direct effect on internals (no splitting triggered by them).
- Non-adjacent or isolated singles (e.g., standalone Blue pixels=1): No change or interaction in either example.

#### Notes on Unknowns:
- The choice of "opposite" color for flips is always the neighbor's color in both examples, but why that neighbor (left vs. right, or both) is unknown (e.g., in train 2 end row, why flip to create Y1 G2 Y1 specifically cannot be explained without assuming a target pattern).
- No consistent interaction for vertical blocks (e.g., tall components spanning multiple y in train 2; train 1 has none).
- For the test input 1, similar horizontal multi-pixel blocks exist (e.g., Maroon [18,2,19,2] pixels=2 adjacent to Yellow [16,2,19,13]; Maroon [10,2,12,4] pixels=6 with internal Blue [10,3,10,3] adjacent), suggesting potential splitting/flips like above, but exact transformation is unknown without solving the multi-panel structure. No forced connections (e.g., no evidence of Yellow-Maroon flip consistent across all examples, as train 1 lacks them).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:39:02] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color manipulation, where the goal appears to be simplifying or extending horizontal runs of colors into solid, uniform stripes or filled regions (e.g., long sequences of the same non-background color like 2's, 3's, or 8's) while preserving certain patterned elements (e.g., vertical or dotted lines of 1's) and respecting boundaries defined by the background color (e.g., 3 in example 1, 4 in example 2, 8 in test). The rules seem to focus on "growing" or "filling" inward from edges or patterns, but the current approach treats it as breaking runs via flips, which inverts the intent.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal filling: Expected outputs show long, continuous horizontal runs of the same color (e.g., rows of all 2's spanning nearly the full width between borders in training examples), suggesting rules for extending colors across gaps or runs rather than splitting them.
 * Background/border color is invariant (e.g., all 3's in example 1 top/bottom, all 4's in example 2 borders, all 8's in test borders), and inner regions are filled solidly except for preserved "features" like vertical lines of 1's or grouped patterns (e.g., pairs or triples of 3's/8's/9's in example 2).
 * Subtle elements: Alternating or short runs (e.g., 2,4,2) in input should resolve to solid fills (e.g., all 2's), but only horizontally—vertical consistency is maintained for special colors like 1 (dotted lines) or 3/8/9 (which form symmetric or repeating blocks). Adjacent colors influence flips/extensions, but only if they match on both sides for symmetry (e.g., in l3/l4 rules, but reversed: extend rather than split).
 * Runs longer than 1-2 should be "absorbed" into neighboring fills if they match the edge color, but isolated patterns (e.g., single 1's in vertical lines) are preserved without alteration.
 * Chaining effects: Applying rules in sequence (l2 then l3 then l4 then l2) can propagate changes, but the current implementation breaks chains instead of building them, leading to fragmentation.
 * Edge cases: No left/right neighbors means no flip (preserve run); vertical interactions are minimal, but horizontal scans must avoid overwriting preserved vertical features (e.g., 1's stay as-is).
 * Overall, the puzzle likely simulates "flood fill" or "region growing" from borders inward, stopping at barriers (e.g., 1's or mismatched colors), but with specific rules for run lengths to decide absorption vs. preservation.
 * Missable subtlety: In example 2, 3's form 2-wide horizontal groups separated by 4's, suggesting paired runs are preserved/merged horizontally if symmetric, but singles are not; similarly for 8's (3-wide groups) and 9's (singles remain dotted).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions attempt to model run-splitting rules but are inverted for the puzzle's filling intent; they could be adapted by reversing flips (e.g., extend run instead of break). No custom types are defined, but a run-finder helper would be useful.

```python
import copy
from typing import List, Optional

def find_horizontal_runs(row: List[int], min_length: int = 2) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Helper to extract runs: returns list of (start_index, length, color) for runs >= min_length.
    Useful for identifying what to fill/extend without scanning every triplet/quad."""
    runs = []
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + min_length - 1 < n:
            c = row[i]
            length = 1
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == c:
                length += 1
                j += 1
            if length >= min_length:
                runs.append((i, length, c))
            i = j
        else:
            break
    return runs
```

```python
def extend_to_adjacent(g: List[List[int]], target_color: int, background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Prototype for filling: For each row, extend target_color runs towards background borders if adjacent.
    Not fully implemented; useful starting point for reversing split logic."""
    h = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(g)):
        row = g[r]
        n = len(row)
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if row[i] == target_color and row[i-1] == background and row[i+1] == background:
                h[r][i] = background  # Wait, no—invert to fill: if short run between same adj, extend adj into it.
                # Actual: if adj same and != run color, fill run with adj color.
    return h
```

The flip_l2, flip_l3, flip_l4 functions are partially helpful as a framework for scanning runs but are broken in direction (they split instead of merge/fill), leading to incorrect fragmentation; do not reuse without inverting the flip logic (e.g., change h[r][i+1] = left_c to extend left_c leftward/rightward). The program composer is unhelpful as-is since order matters but current sequence creates chains of breaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies the need for horizontal run processing (l2/l3/l4) and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, but fails to create solid fills—instead, it scatters colors (e.g., in train 1, generates [3,2,3,2,3,...] vs. expected [3,2,2,2,...] long 2's).
 * What worked: Basic scanning for equal runs (e.g., detects l2/l3/l4 accurately) and conditional flips based on adjacents (e.g., only if left != c); the final l2 pass handles some chaining.
 * What didn't: Core misunderstanding—rules split runs (e.g., flipping middle/end to adjacent) when the puzzle wants to merge/extend them (e.g., train 1 row 1 expected all 2's from short 2's, but generated alternates 2/3; train 2 row 2 generated short 2's and scattered 4's vs. expected long 2's). In train 2, 3's/8's/9's are not grouped correctly (e.g., generated single 3's and 4-interrupted 8's vs. expected paired/tripled groups like [3,3] or [8,8,8]).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Row 1/3 have broken 2-runs with inserted 3's (e.g., generated [3,2,3,2,...] due to l3 flipping right end to left 3, but expected ignores borders and fills all inner to 2); row 2 preserves 1's correctly but doesn't affect fills.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper sections generate dotted 3/4/2 patterns instead of solid 2's and grouped 3's (e.g., row 2: generated [4,2,4,2,...] vs. expected [4,2,2,2,...]); lower sections fail to merge 8's into 3-wide (e.g., row 12: generated scattered 8/4 vs. expected [8,4,8,8,8,...]); 1's preserved but 9's not dotted correctly.
 * No vertical processing, which is fine (puzzle is horizontal), but misses symmetry (e.g., example 2 has mirrored rows for 3/8/9).
 * Function flip_l3 is broken for l=3 cases where adjacents match (flips middle to them, creating breaks; should fill run to adj instead). flip_l4 under-applies (only if both adj same, but doesn't chain to longer runs). flip_l2 over-applies, breaking pairs prematurely.
 * extract_objects not present/attempted; a run-extractor (like above) would help identify fillable regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a noisy, alternating mess of 8's, 3's, and scattered 1/2/4/9's with short runs (e.g., row 2: [8,3,8,3,...] repeating pairs), whereas training examples suggest solid horizontal fills of 3? (likely the "2" equivalent here) between 8-borders, with preserved vertical dotted lines of 1's and grouped blocks for 4/9 (e.g., expected probably long 3-runs in even rows, dotted 1's untouched, paired 4's, and symmetric 9's). This matches the attempt's splitting error, fragmenting what should be uniform stripes; it ignores the pattern of input (repeating 3/8 motifs) to build wider fills, and over-flips edges (e.g., many 3,8,3 instead of 3,3,3 or similar). Unknown why 2's appear in odd places (e.g., row 3 has 2's inserted), but likely from l2/l3 misfires on input runs.

[2025-10-03 14:39:10] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided descriptions and train examples, below is a list of obvious and consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear to interact or affect each other in **every** example (train input 1, train output 1, train input 2, train output 2, and the test input). I focused only on consistencies across **all** of them, ignoring unique or inconsistent elements (e.g., Yellow, Maroon, Light Blue appear only in train 2 and test, so no connections involving them are included; transformations like splitting or inserting are noted as unknown where not explainable without forcing a solution). No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated positions without adjacency or effect) are included. Connections are based on shared properties like position (bbox overlap or adjacency), color adjacency, hole counts, or enclosure.

1. **Green outer frame (holes=1, large bbox enclosing entire content, e.g., [0,0,12,4] in train 1, [0,0,21,20] variant in train 2, [0,0,28,28] in test) interacts with Red inner container (holes=1, nested bbox inside Green frame, e.g., [1,1,11,3] in train 1, multiple stacked [1,1,20,4] etc. in train 2) via enclosure**: The Red is consistently positioned inside the Green frame's bbox, with the Green's hole count (1) corresponding to the space occupied by the Red (suggesting the Red "punches" the hole in the Green). This holds in all examples, including test where Green panels replace Red but maintain enclosure by large Maroon background (holes vary, but enclosure pattern persists). No transformation explanation possible—unknown how positions shift.

2. **Blue small elements (holes=0, pixels=1, single-pixel bbox like [2,2,2,2]) interact with adjacent Green elements (holes=0, small bbox like [3,2,3,2], pixels=1-3) via horizontal position adjacency in rows**: Blues are consistently spaced horizontally next to Greens at the same y-level (e.g., x=2 Blue next to x=3 Green in train 1; similar in train 2 rows at y=7/8 and test scattered Blues adjacent to Greens). In transformations (train 1 input to output), a wider Green (pixels=3, bbox spanning multiple x) adjacent to Blues is affected (split, with new Blue inserted at median x-position), maintaining adjacency pattern. This is consistent across all, but exact split mechanism (e.g., position -> new Blue insertion) is unknown—no clear rule for when/why without solving.

3. **Red inner container (holes=1, rectangular bbox) interacts with contained Blue elements via vertical/horizontal positioning**: Blues (small, holes=0) are consistently inside the Red's bbox (e.g., all Blues in train 1 within [1,1,11,3]; stacked Reds in train 2 contain Blues in their y-ranges; test Reds like [3,3,4,4] are small but enclosed in Green panels analogous to Red). The Red's hole count (1) aligns with the collective space of contained Blues/Greens. Transformations do not alter this enclosure (e.g., train 1 output keeps Blues inside Red). Position of Blues affects Red's pixel count indirectly (Red pixels decrease if content changes, but consistent in all). Unknown how test's small Reds transform if at all.

4. **Green elements (small, holes=0, pixels=1-4) interact with Blue elements via alternating color-position sequence in horizontal rows**: In all examples, small Greens and Blues alternate in x-position within the same y-level inside containers (e.g., Blue-Green-Blue-Green in train 1 row y=2; Blue-Yellow alternates in train 2 but Green frame separates consistently; test Blues adjacent to Green panels in x-ranges like 8-13, 15-20). Transformations (e.g., train 1) preserve or enforce this alternation by adjusting Green bbox width to match single-pixel Blues. Consistent across every example, but any color-shift effect (e.g., Green width -> Blue insertion) is unknown.

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent interactions found for hole count -> color (e.g., holes=1 always on frames/Red, but test has varying holes on Maroon without clear effect on Blues/Greens).
- Position -> transformation (e.g., adjacent x/y leading to split/merge) appears in trains but cannot be explained consistently for test without forcing (e.g., test has vertical stacking of Blues/Maroons, but no clear horizontal split like train 1—marked unknown).
- No semantic shape connections (e.g., silhouettes or edges) identifiable from bbox/pixels alone—data lacks edge details.
- Irrelevant elements excluded: e.g., test's Yellow/Light Blue have no adjacency to Blues/Greens/Red across all examples; train 2's Maroon merges are not in train 1 or test consistently.
- Overall, transformations (e.g., insertion/splitting in trains) cannot be fully explained as consistent without puzzle-solving—only positional enclosure and adjacency are obvious and universal.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:39:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color manipulation, where the goal appears to be simplifying or extending horizontal runs of colors into solid, uniform stripes or filled regions (e.g., long sequences of the same non-background color like 2's, 3's, or 8's) while preserving certain patterned elements (e.g., vertical or dotted lines of 1's) and respecting boundaries defined by the background color (e.g., 3 in example 1, 4 in example 2, 8 in test). The rules seem to focus on "growing" or "filling" inward from edges or patterns, but the current approach treats it as breaking runs via flips, which inverts the intent.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal filling: Expected outputs show long, continuous horizontal runs of the same color (e.g., rows of all 2's spanning nearly the full width between borders in training examples), suggesting rules for extending colors across gaps or runs rather than splitting them.
 * Background/border color is invariant (e.g., all 3's in example 1 top/bottom, all 4's in example 2 borders, all 8's in test borders), and inner regions are filled solidly except for preserved "features" like vertical lines of 1's or grouped patterns (e.g., pairs or triples of 3's/8's/9's in example 2).
 * Subtle elements: Alternating or short runs (e.g., 2,4,2) in input should resolve to solid fills (e.g., all 2's), but only horizontally—vertical consistency is maintained for special colors like 1 (dotted lines) or 3/8/9 (which form symmetric or repeating blocks). Adjacent colors influence flips/extensions, but only if they match on both sides for symmetry (e.g., in l3/l4 rules, but reversed: extend rather than split).
 * Runs longer than 1-2 should be "absorbed" into neighboring fills if they match the edge color, but isolated patterns (e.g., single 1's in vertical lines) are preserved without alteration.
 * Chaining effects: Applying rules in sequence (l2 then l3 then l4 then l2) can propagate changes, but the current implementation breaks chains instead of building them, leading to fragmentation.
 * Edge cases: No left/right neighbors means no flip (preserve run); vertical interactions are minimal, but horizontal scans must avoid overwriting preserved vertical features (e.g., 1's stay as-is).
 * Overall, the puzzle likely simulates "flood fill" or "region growing" from borders inward, stopping at barriers (e.g., 1's or mismatched colors), but with specific rules for run lengths to decide absorption vs. preservation.
 * Missable subtlety: In example 2, 3's form 2-wide horizontal groups separated by 4's, suggesting paired runs are preserved/merged horizontally if symmetric, but singles are not; similarly for 8's (3-wide groups) and 9's (singles remain dotted).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions attempt to model run-splitting rules but are inverted for the puzzle's filling intent; they could be adapted by reversing flips (e.g., extend run instead of break). No custom types are defined, but a run-finder helper would be useful.

```python
import copy
from typing import List, Optional

def find_horizontal_runs(row: List[int], min_length: int = 2) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Helper to extract runs: returns list of (start_index, length, color) for runs >= min_length.
    Useful for identifying what to fill/extend without scanning every triplet/quad."""
    runs = []
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + min_length - 1 < n:
            c = row[i]
            length = 1
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == c:
                length += 1
                j += 1
            if length >= min_length:
                runs.append((i, length, c))
            i = j
        else:
            break
    return runs
```

```python
def extend_to_adjacent(g: List[List[int]], target_color: int, background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Prototype for filling: For each row, extend target_color runs towards background borders if adjacent.
    Not fully implemented; useful starting point for reversing split logic."""
    h = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(g)):
        row = g[r]
        n = len(row)
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if row[i] == target_color and row[i-1] == background and row[i+1] == background:
                h[r][i] = background  # Wait, no—invert to fill: if short run between same adj, extend adj into it.
                # Actual: if adj same and != run color, fill run with adj color.
    return h
```

The flip_l2, flip_l3, flip_l4 functions are partially helpful as a framework for scanning runs but are broken in direction (they split instead of merge/fill), leading to incorrect fragmentation; do not reuse without inverting the flip logic (e.g., change h[r][i+1] = left_c to extend left_c leftward/rightward). The program composer is unhelpful as-is since order matters but current sequence creates chains of breaks.

 * The attempt correctly identifies the need for horizontal run processing (l2/l3/l4) and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, but fails to create solid fills—instead, it scatters colors (e.g., in train 1, generates [3,2,3,2,3,...] vs. expected [3,2,2,2,...] long 2's).
 * What worked: Basic scanning for equal runs (e.g., detects l2/l3/l4 accurately) and conditional flips based on adjacents (e.g., only if left != c); the final l2 pass handles some chaining.
 * What didn't: Core misunderstanding—rules split runs (e.g., flipping middle/end to adjacent) when the puzzle wants to merge/extend them (e.g., train 1 row 1 expected all 2's from short 2's, but generated alternates 2/3; train 2 row 2 generated short 2's and scattered 4's vs. expected long 2's). In train 2, 3's/8's/9's are not grouped correctly (e.g., generated single 3's and 4-interrupted 8's vs. expected paired/tripled groups like [3,3] or [8,8,8]).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Row 1/3 have broken 2-runs with inserted 3's (e.g., generated [3,2,3,2,...] due to l3 flipping right end to left 3, but expected ignores borders and fills all inner to 2); row 2 preserves 1's correctly but doesn't affect fills.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper sections generate dotted 3/4/2 patterns instead of solid 2's and grouped 3's (e.g., row 2: generated [4,2,4,2,...] vs. expected [4,2,2,2,...]); lower sections fail to merge 8's into 3-wide (e.g., row 12: generated scattered 8/4 vs. expected [8,4,8,8,8,...]); 1's preserved but 9's not dotted correctly.
 * No vertical processing, which is fine (puzzle is horizontal), but misses symmetry (e.g., example 2 has mirrored rows for 3/8/9).
 * Function flip_l3 is broken for l=3 cases where adjacents match (flips middle to them, creating breaks; should fill run to adj instead). flip_l4 under-applies (only if both adj same, but doesn't chain to longer runs). flip_l2 over-applies, breaking pairs prematurely.
 * extract_objects not present/attempted; a run-extractor (like above) would help identify fillable regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a noisy, alternating mess of 8's, 3's, and scattered 1/2/4/9's with short runs (e.g., row 2: [8,3,8,3,...] repeating pairs), whereas training examples suggest solid horizontal fills of 3? (likely the "2" equivalent here) between 8-borders, with preserved vertical dotted lines of 1's and grouped blocks for 4/9 (e.g., expected probably long 3-runs in even rows, dotted 1's untouched, paired 4's, and symmetric 9's). This matches the attempt's splitting error, fragmenting what should be uniform stripes; it ignores the pattern of input (repeating 3/8 motifs) to build wider fills, and over-flips edges (e.g., many 3,8,3 instead of 3,3,3 or similar). Unknown why 2's appear in odd places (e.g., row 3 has 2's inserted), but likely from l2/l3 misfires on input runs.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]

    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:

    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; simple and reliable if grid is consistent.)

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Checks for bordered rows; essential for identifying candidates, but misses partial borders.)

        return 1, 0
    if row[1] == 2 and row[w - 2] == 2:
        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Core for identifying the pattern color c; strict majority threshold is a good subtlety to avoid noise, using collections.Counter.)

```python
def get_period(c: int) -> int:
    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided descriptions and train examples, below is a list of obvious and consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear to interact or affect each other in **every** example (train input 1, train output 1, train input 2, train output 2, and the test input). I focused only on consistencies across **all** of them, ignoring unique or inconsistent elements (e.g., Yellow, Maroon, Light Blue appear only in train 2 and test, so no connections involving them are included; transformations like splitting or inserting are noted as unknown where not explainable without forcing a solution). No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated positions without adjacency or effect) are included. Connections are based on shared properties like position (bbox overlap or adjacency), color adjacency, hole counts, or enclosure.

1. **Green outer frame (holes=1, large bbox enclosing entire content, e.g., [0,0,12,4] in train 1, [0,0,21,20] variant in train 2, [0,0,28,28] in test) interacts with Red inner container (holes=1, nested bbox inside Green frame, e.g., [1,1,11,3] in train 1, multiple stacked [1,1,20,4] etc. in train 2) via enclosure**: The Red is consistently positioned inside the Green frame's bbox, with the Green's hole count (1) corresponding to the space occupied by the Red (suggesting the Red "punches" the hole in the Green). This holds in all examples, including test where Green panels replace Red but maintain enclosure by large Maroon background (holes vary, but enclosure pattern persists). No transformation explanation possible—unknown how positions shift.

2. **Blue small elements (holes=0, pixels=1, single-pixel bbox like [2,2,2,2]) interact with adjacent Green elements (holes=0, small bbox like [3,2,3,2], pixels=1-3) via horizontal position adjacency in rows**: Blues are consistently spaced horizontally next to Greens at the same y-level (e.g., x=2 Blue next to x=3 Green in train 1; similar in train 2 rows at y=7/8 and test scattered Blues adjacent to Greens). In transformations (train 1 input to output), a wider Green (pixels=3, bbox spanning multiple x) adjacent to Blues is affected (split, with new Blue inserted at median x-position), maintaining adjacency pattern. This is consistent across all, but exact split mechanism (e.g., position -> new Blue insertion) is unknown—no clear rule for when/why without solving.

3. **Red inner container (holes=1, rectangular bbox) interacts with contained Blue elements via vertical/horizontal positioning**: Blues (small, holes=0) are consistently inside the Red's bbox (e.g., all Blues in train 1 within [1,1,11,3]; stacked Reds in train 2 contain Blues in their y-ranges; test Reds like [3,3,4,4] are small but enclosed in Green panels analogous to Red). The Red's hole count (1) aligns with the collective space of contained Blues/Greens. Transformations do not alter this enclosure (e.g., train 1 output keeps Blues inside Red). Position of Blues affects Red's pixel count indirectly (Red pixels decrease if content changes, but consistent in all). Unknown how test's small Reds transform if at all.

4. **Green elements (small, holes=0, pixels=1-4) interact with Blue elements via alternating color-position sequence in horizontal rows**: In all examples, small Greens and Blues alternate in x-position within the same y-level inside containers (e.g., Blue-Green-Blue-Green in train 1 row y=2; Blue-Yellow alternates in train 2 but Green frame separates consistently; test Blues adjacent to Green panels in x-ranges like 8-13, 15-20). Transformations (e.g., train 1) preserve or enforce this alternation by adjusting Green bbox width to match single-pixel Blues. Consistent across every example, but any color-shift effect (e.g., Green width -> Blue insertion) is unknown.

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent interactions found for hole count -> color (e.g., holes=1 always on frames/Red, but test has varying holes on Maroon without clear effect on Blues/Greens).
- Position -> transformation (e.g., adjacent x/y leading to split/merge) appears in trains but cannot be explained consistently for test without forcing (e.g., test has vertical stacking of Blues/Maroons, but no clear horizontal split like train 1—marked unknown).
- No semantic shape connections (e.g., silhouettes or edges) identifiable from bbox/pixels alone—data lacks edge details.
- Irrelevant elements excluded: e.g., test's Yellow/Light Blue have no adjacency to Blues/Greens/Red across all examples; train 2's Maroon merges are not in train 1 or test consistently.
- Overall, transformations (e.g., insertion/splitting in trains) cannot be fully explained as consistent without puzzle-solving—only positional enclosure and adjacency are obvious and universal.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:43:15] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subinner: List[int], c: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(subinner)
    while i < n:
        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

```python
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    n = len(subinner)
    if n == 0:
        return None
    u = g_val + 1
    best_dist = float('inf')
    best_preserved = -1
    best_shift = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    for shift in range(u):
        pattern = [0] * n
        for ii in range(n):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

[2025-10-03 14:43:21] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed **in every puzzle** (both train examples). These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in a repeatable way across both examples. No high-level interpretations, irrelevant elements (e.g., unchanged static backgrounds like large Yellow h=4 or Red h=1 frames, which do not interact dynamically), or inconsistent elements (e.g., Maroon-Yellow merges or width=2 adjustments, which appear only in train 2) are included. Only direct, structural connections tied to transformations are listed. Where a transformation's details (e.g., exact alternate color selection) cannot be explained without forcing an inconsistent rule, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Component: Color (any single-color blob, e.g., Green, Blue, Light Blue) + Property: bbox x-span (x_max - x_min + 1 = 3) + holes=0 → Interaction with: Position (middle x = x_min + 1, same y-range) → Effect: Transformation/Splitting**
   - Consistent in every puzzle: A connected component (blob) spanning exactly 3 units in x-direction (bbox width=3), with no holes, triggers a split. The middle x-position (exactly 1 unit from edges) changes color to an alternate (context-local opposite color), creating a new 1-unit-wide component there. The original component splits into two 1-unit-wide components of the original color (at x_min and x_max positions).
   - Examples:
     - Train 1: Green (bbox x=7-9, y=2-2, pixels=3) → Middle x=8 transforms to Blue (new Blue bbox x=8, y=2-2, pixels=1); splits to Green x=7 and Green x=9 (each pixels=1).
     - Train 2: Blue (bbox x=8-10, y=7-8, pixels=4) → Middle x=9 transforms to Yellow; splits to Blue x=8 and Blue x=10.
     - Train 2: Light Blue (bbox x=8-10, y=17-18, pixels=5) → Middle x=9 transforms to Yellow; splits to Light Blue x=8 and Light Blue x=10.
   - Notes: This is the only transformation consistent across all examples. The alternate color (e.g., Green→Blue, Blue→Yellow) depends on local pattern context (unknown exact rule, as it varies by puzzle section but always opposes the original in the alternating sequence). Pixels property does not consistently affect the outcome (varies 3-5 in inputs). No effect on y-span or holes. Irrelevant for width≠3 or h>0 components.

2. **Property: Position (x-coordinates of small 1x1 components, e.g., single-pixel Blue or Green) + Property: Adjacent component widths → Interaction with: Local color alternation pattern → Effect: Repositioning for even spacing**
   - Consistent in every puzzle: Positions of 1-unit (single-pixel) components in a linear horizontal sequence interact with nearby wide components (width=3, as above). Post-transformation, all components realign to even 2-unit spacing (e.g., element-separator-element with single-unit separators), adjusting x-positions without changing colors or counts beyond the split.
   - Examples:
     - Train 1: Blues at x=2,4,6,10 (uneven, with gap after x=6 due to width=3 Green at 7-9) → After split/insert, repositions to x=2,4,6,8,10 (even 2-unit steps).
     - Train 2: Blues at y=7 (x=2,4,6,8-10 clustered,12,14,16,18 due to width=3 Blue at 8-10) → After split/insert, repositions to x=2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 (even every-other-x).
     - Train 2: Light Blues at y=17 (similar clustering x=2,4,6,8-10, then 12,14,16,18) → After split/insert, repositions to even every-other-x.
   - Notes: This ensures consistent alternation (e.g., color1 at even x, color2 at odd x) post-transformation. Only affects sequences already attempting horizontal linearity (e.g., rows at fixed y). No vertical repositioning observed. Unknown how "local pattern" defines the starting parity (e.g., Blue at even x in some rows, odd in others).

No other interactions (e.g., hole count → color, vertical position → transform, or silhouette/edge effects on movement) are consistent across every puzzle. Elements like large Red (h=1) or Yellow (h=4) backgrounds do not interact or transform. Color-specific rules (e.g., only Green in train 1) are not universal, as train 2 uses Blue/Light Blue. No consistent effects from pixels count, y-span >1, or non-horizontal positions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:44:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color manipulation, where the goal appears to be simplifying or extending horizontal runs of colors into solid, uniform stripes or filled regions (e.g., long sequences of the same non-background color like 2's, 3's, or 8's) while preserving certain patterned elements (e.g., vertical or dotted lines of 1's) and respecting boundaries defined by the background color (e.g., 3 in example 1, 4 in example 2, 8 in test). The rules seem to focus on "growing" or "filling" inward from edges or patterns, but the current approach treats it as breaking runs via flips, which inverts the intent.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal filling: Expected outputs show long, continuous horizontal runs of the same color (e.g., rows of all 2's spanning nearly the full width between borders in training examples), suggesting rules for extending colors across gaps or runs rather than splitting them.
 * Background/border color is invariant (e.g., all 3's in example 1 top/bottom, all 4's in example 2 borders, all 8's in test borders), and inner regions are filled solidly except for preserved "features" like vertical lines of 1's or grouped patterns (e.g., pairs or triples of 3's/8's/9's in example 2).
 * Subtle elements: Alternating or short runs (e.g., 2,4,2) in input should resolve to solid fills (e.g., all 2's), but only horizontally—vertical consistency is maintained for special colors like 1 (dotted lines) or 3/8/9 (which form symmetric or repeating blocks). Adjacent colors influence flips/extensions, but only if they match on both sides for symmetry (e.g., in l3/l4 rules, but reversed: extend rather than split).
 * Runs longer than 1-2 should be "absorbed" into neighboring fills if they match the edge color, but isolated patterns (e.g., single 1's in vertical lines) are preserved without alteration.
 * Chaining effects: Applying rules in sequence (l2 then l3 then l4 then l2) can propagate changes, but the current implementation breaks chains instead of building them, leading to fragmentation.
 * Edge cases: No left/right neighbors means no flip (preserve run); vertical interactions are minimal, but horizontal scans must avoid overwriting preserved vertical features (e.g., 1's stay as-is).
 * Overall, the puzzle likely simulates "flood fill" or "region growing" from borders inward, stopping at barriers (e.g., 1's or mismatched colors), but with specific rules for run lengths to decide absorption vs. preservation.
 * Missable subtlety: In example 2, 3's form 2-wide horizontal groups separated by 4's, suggesting paired runs are preserved/merged horizontally if symmetric, but singles are not; similarly for 8's (3-wide groups) and 9's (singles remain dotted).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions attempt to model run-splitting rules but are inverted for the puzzle's filling intent; they could be adapted by reversing flips (e.g., extend run instead of break). No custom types are defined, but a run-finder helper would be useful.

```python
import copy
from typing import List, Optional

def find_horizontal_runs(row: List[int], min_length: int = 2) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Helper to extract runs: returns list of (start_index, length, color) for runs >= min_length.
    Useful for identifying what to fill/extend without scanning every triplet/quad."""
    runs = []
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + min_length - 1 < n:
            c = row[i]
            length = 1
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == c:
                length += 1
                j += 1
            if length >= min_length:
                runs.append((i, length, c))
            i = j
        else:
            break
    return runs
```

```python
def extend_to_adjacent(g: List[List[int]], target_color: int, background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Prototype for filling: For each row, extend target_color runs towards background borders if adjacent.
    Not fully implemented; useful starting point for reversing split logic."""
    h = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(g)):
        row = g[r]
        n = len(row)
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if row[i] == target_color and row[i-1] == background and row[i+1] == background:
                h[r][i] = background  # Wait, no—invert to fill: if short run between same adj, extend adj into it.
                # Actual: if adj same and != run color, fill run with adj color.
    return h
```

The flip_l2, flip_l3, flip_l4 functions are partially helpful as a framework for scanning runs but are broken in direction (they split instead of merge/fill), leading to incorrect fragmentation; do not reuse without inverting the flip logic (e.g., change h[r][i+1] = left_c to extend left_c leftward/rightward). The program composer is unhelpful as-is since order matters but current sequence creates chains of breaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies the need for horizontal run processing (l2/l3/l4) and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, but fails to create solid fills—instead, it scatters colors (e.g., in train 1, generates [3,2,3,2,3,...] vs. expected [3,2,2,2,...] long 2's).
 * What worked: Basic scanning for equal runs (e.g., detects l2/l3/l4 accurately) and conditional flips based on adjacents (e.g., only if left != c); the final l2 pass handles some chaining.
 * What didn't: Core misunderstanding—rules split runs (e.g., flipping middle/end to adjacent) when the puzzle wants to merge/extend them (e.g., train 1 row 1 expected all 2's from short 2's, but generated alternates 2/3; train 2 row 2 generated short 2's and scattered 4's vs. expected long 2's). In train 2, 3's/8's/9's are not grouped correctly (e.g., generated single 3's and 4-interrupted 8's vs. expected paired/tripled groups like [3,3] or [8,8,8]).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Row 1/3 have broken 2-runs with inserted 3's (e.g., generated [3,2,3,2,...] due to l3 flipping right end to left 3, but expected ignores borders and fills all inner to 2); row 2 preserves 1's correctly but doesn't affect fills.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper sections generate dotted 3/4/2 patterns instead of solid 2's and grouped 3's (e.g., row 2: generated [4,2,4,2,...] vs. expected [4,2,2,2,...]); lower sections fail to merge 8's into 3-wide (e.g., row 12: generated scattered 8/4 vs. expected [8,4,8,8,8,...]); 1's preserved but 9's not dotted correctly.
 * No vertical processing, which is fine (puzzle is horizontal), but misses symmetry (e.g., example 2 has mirrored rows for 3/8/9).
 * Function flip_l3 is broken for l=3 cases where adjacents match (flips middle to them, creating breaks; should fill run to adj instead). flip_l4 under-applies (only if both adj same, but doesn't chain to longer runs). flip_l2 over-applies, breaking pairs prematurely.
 * extract_objects not present/attempted; a run-extractor (like above) would help identify fillable regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a noisy, alternating mess of 8's, 3's, and scattered 1/2/4/9's with short runs (e.g., row 2: [8,3,8,3,...] repeating pairs), whereas training examples suggest solid horizontal fills of 3? (likely the "2" equivalent here) between 8-borders, with preserved vertical dotted lines of 1's and grouped blocks for 4/9 (e.g., expected probably long 3-runs in even rows, dotted 1's untouched, paired 4's, and symmetric 9's). This matches the attempt's splitting error, fragmenting what should be uniform stripes; it ignores the pattern of input (repeating 3/8 motifs) to build wider fills, and over-flips edges (e.g., many 3,8,3 instead of 3,3,3 or similar). Unknown why 2's appear in odd places (e.g., row 3 has 2's inserted), but likely from l2/l3 misfires on input runs.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

```python
from typing import List

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:

(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]

    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:

    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; simple and reliable if grid is consistent.)

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Checks for bordered rows; essential for identifying candidates, but misses partial borders.)

    w = len(row)
    if w < 3:
        return 1, 0
    if row[1] == 2 and row[w - 2] == 2:
        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Core for identifying the pattern color c; strict majority threshold is a good subtlety to avoid noise, using collections.Counter.)

```python
def get_period(c: int) -> int:
    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subinner: List[int], c: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(subinner)
    while i < n:
        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

```python
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    n = len(subinner)
    if n == 0:
        return None
    u = g_val + 1
    best_dist = float('inf')
    best_preserved = -1
    best_shift = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    for shift in range(u):
        pattern = [0] * n
        for ii in range(n):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed **in every puzzle** (both train examples). These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in a repeatable way across both examples. No high-level interpretations, irrelevant elements (e.g., unchanged static backgrounds like large Yellow h=4 or Red h=1 frames, which do not interact dynamically), or inconsistent elements (e.g., Maroon-Yellow merges or width=2 adjustments, which appear only in train 2) are included. Only direct, structural connections tied to transformations are listed. Where a transformation's details (e.g., exact alternate color selection) cannot be explained without forcing an inconsistent rule, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Component: Color (any single-color blob, e.g., Green, Blue, Light Blue) + Property: bbox x-span (x_max - x_min + 1 = 3) + holes=0 → Interaction with: Position (middle x = x_min + 1, same y-range) → Effect: Transformation/Splitting**
   - Consistent in every puzzle: A connected component (blob) spanning exactly 3 units in x-direction (bbox width=3), with no holes, triggers a split. The middle x-position (exactly 1 unit from edges) changes color to an alternate (context-local opposite color), creating a new 1-unit-wide component there. The original component splits into two 1-unit-wide components of the original color (at x_min and x_max positions).
   - Examples:
     - Train 1: Green (bbox x=7-9, y=2-2, pixels=3) → Middle x=8 transforms to Blue (new Blue bbox x=8, y=2-2, pixels=1); splits to Green x=7 and Green x=9 (each pixels=1).
     - Train 2: Blue (bbox x=8-10, y=7-8, pixels=4) → Middle x=9 transforms to Yellow; splits to Blue x=8 and Blue x=10.
     - Train 2: Light Blue (bbox x=8-10, y=17-18, pixels=5) → Middle x=9 transforms to Yellow; splits to Light Blue x=8 and Light Blue x=10.
   - Notes: This is the only transformation consistent across all examples. The alternate color (e.g., Green→Blue, Blue→Yellow) depends on local pattern context (unknown exact rule, as it varies by puzzle section but always opposes the original in the alternating sequence). Pixels property does not consistently affect the outcome (varies 3-5 in inputs). No effect on y-span or holes. Irrelevant for width≠3 or h>0 components.

2. **Property: Position (x-coordinates of small 1x1 components, e.g., single-pixel Blue or Green) + Property: Adjacent component widths → Interaction with: Local color alternation pattern → Effect: Repositioning for even spacing**
   - Consistent in every puzzle: Positions of 1-unit (single-pixel) components in a linear horizontal sequence interact with nearby wide components (width=3, as above). Post-transformation, all components realign to even 2-unit spacing (e.g., element-separator-element with single-unit separators), adjusting x-positions without changing colors or counts beyond the split.
   - Examples:
     - Train 1: Blues at x=2,4,6,10 (uneven, with gap after x=6 due to width=3 Green at 7-9) → After split/insert, repositions to x=2,4,6,8,10 (even 2-unit steps).
     - Train 2: Blues at y=7 (x=2,4,6,8-10 clustered,12,14,16,18 due to width=3 Blue at 8-10) → After split/insert, repositions to x=2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 (even every-other-x).
     - Train 2: Light Blues at y=17 (similar clustering x=2,4,6,8-10, then 12,14,16,18) → After split/insert, repositions to even every-other-x.
   - Notes: This ensures consistent alternation (e.g., color1 at even x, color2 at odd x) post-transformation. Only affects sequences already attempting horizontal linearity (e.g., rows at fixed y). No vertical repositioning observed. Unknown how "local pattern" defines the starting parity (e.g., Blue at even x in some rows, odd in others).

No other interactions (e.g., hole count → color, vertical position → transform, or silhouette/edge effects on movement) are consistent across every puzzle. Elements like large Red (h=1) or Yellow (h=4) backgrounds do not interact or transform. Color-specific rules (e.g., only Green in train 1) are not universal, as train 2 uses Blue/Light Blue. No consistent effects from pixels count, y-span >1, or non-horizontal positions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 14:47:22] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))

def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 14:47:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

[2025-10-03 14:47:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:50:53] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                changes += num_pos - max_f
        cost = changes + p
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            best_p = p
    return min_cost, best_p

    if w < 4:
        return row
    s_start = 2
    s_end = w - 2
    s = row[s_start : s_end]
    L = len(s)
    if L == 0:
        return row
    _, best_p = get_min_cost_and_p(s)
    new_s = compute_periodic_correction(s, best_p)
    new_row = row[:]
    new_row[s_start : s_end] = new_s
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

[2025-10-03 14:50:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

[2025-10-03 14:53:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color manipulation, where the goal appears to be simplifying or extending horizontal runs of colors into solid, uniform stripes or filled regions (e.g., long sequences of the same non-background color like 2's, 3's, or 8's) while preserving certain patterned elements (e.g., vertical or dotted lines of 1's) and respecting boundaries defined by the background color (e.g., 3 in example 1, 4 in example 2, 8 in test). The rules seem to focus on "growing" or "filling" inward from edges or patterns, but the current approach treats it as breaking runs via flips, which inverts the intent.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal filling: Expected outputs show long, continuous horizontal runs of the same color (e.g., rows of all 2's spanning nearly the full width between borders in training examples), suggesting rules for extending colors across gaps or runs rather than splitting them.
 * Background/border color is invariant (e.g., all 3's in example 1 top/bottom, all 4's in example 2 borders, all 8's in test borders), and inner regions are filled solidly except for preserved "features" like vertical lines of 1's or grouped patterns (e.g., pairs or triples of 3's/8's/9's in example 2).
 * Subtle elements: Alternating or short runs (e.g., 2,4,2) in input should resolve to solid fills (e.g., all 2's), but only horizontally—vertical consistency is maintained for special colors like 1 (dotted lines) or 3/8/9 (which form symmetric or repeating blocks). Adjacent colors influence flips/extensions, but only if they match on both sides for symmetry (e.g., in l3/l4 rules, but reversed: extend rather than split).
 * Runs longer than 1-2 should be "absorbed" into neighboring fills if they match the edge color, but isolated patterns (e.g., single 1's in vertical lines) are preserved without alteration.
 * Chaining effects: Applying rules in sequence (l2 then l3 then l4 then l2) can propagate changes, but the current implementation breaks chains instead of building them, leading to fragmentation.
 * Edge cases: No left/right neighbors means no flip (preserve run); vertical interactions are minimal, but horizontal scans must avoid overwriting preserved vertical features (e.g., 1's stay as-is).
 * Overall, the puzzle likely simulates "flood fill" or "region growing" from borders inward, stopping at barriers (e.g., 1's or mismatched colors), but with specific rules for run lengths to decide absorption vs. preservation.
 * Missable subtlety: In example 2, 3's form 2-wide horizontal groups separated by 4's, suggesting paired runs are preserved/merged horizontally if symmetric, but singles are not; similarly for 8's (3-wide groups) and 9's (singles remain dotted).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions attempt to model run-splitting rules but are inverted for the puzzle's filling intent; they could be adapted by reversing flips (e.g., extend run instead of break). No custom types are defined, but a run-finder helper would be useful.

```python
import copy
from typing import List, Optional

def find_horizontal_runs(row: List[int], min_length: int = 2) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Helper to extract runs: returns list of (start_index, length, color) for runs >= min_length.
    Useful for identifying what to fill/extend without scanning every triplet/quad."""
    runs = []
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + min_length - 1 < n:
            c = row[i]
            length = 1
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == c:
                length += 1
                j += 1
            if length >= min_length:
                runs.append((i, length, c))
            i = j
        else:
            break
    return runs
```

```python
def extend_to_adjacent(g: List[List[int]], target_color: int, background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Prototype for filling: For each row, extend target_color runs towards background borders if adjacent.
    Not fully implemented; useful starting point for reversing split logic."""
    h = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(g)):
        row = g[r]
        n = len(row)
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if row[i] == target_color and row[i-1] == background and row[i+1] == background:
                h[r][i] = background  # Wait, no—invert to fill: if short run between same adj, extend adj into it.
                # Actual: if adj same and != run color, fill run with adj color.
    return h
```

The flip_l2, flip_l3, flip_l4 functions are partially helpful as a framework for scanning runs but are broken in direction (they split instead of merge/fill), leading to incorrect fragmentation; do not reuse without inverting the flip logic (e.g., change h[r][i+1] = left_c to extend left_c leftward/rightward). The program composer is unhelpful as-is since order matters but current sequence creates chains of breaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies the need for horizontal run processing (l2/l3/l4) and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, but fails to create solid fills—instead, it scatters colors (e.g., in train 1, generates [3,2,3,2,3,...] vs. expected [3,2,2,2,...] long 2's).
 * What worked: Basic scanning for equal runs (e.g., detects l2/l3/l4 accurately) and conditional flips based on adjacents (e.g., only if left != c); the final l2 pass handles some chaining.
 * What didn't: Core misunderstanding—rules split runs (e.g., flipping middle/end to adjacent) when the puzzle wants to merge/extend them (e.g., train 1 row 1 expected all 2's from short 2's, but generated alternates 2/3; train 2 row 2 generated short 2's and scattered 4's vs. expected long 2's). In train 2, 3's/8's/9's are not grouped correctly (e.g., generated single 3's and 4-interrupted 8's vs. expected paired/tripled groups like [3,3] or [8,8,8]).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Row 1/3 have broken 2-runs with inserted 3's (e.g., generated [3,2,3,2,...] due to l3 flipping right end to left 3, but expected ignores borders and fills all inner to 2); row 2 preserves 1's correctly but doesn't affect fills.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper sections generate dotted 3/4/2 patterns instead of solid 2's and grouped 3's (e.g., row 2: generated [4,2,4,2,...] vs. expected [4,2,2,2,...]); lower sections fail to merge 8's into 3-wide (e.g., row 12: generated scattered 8/4 vs. expected [8,4,8,8,8,...]); 1's preserved but 9's not dotted correctly.
 * No vertical processing, which is fine (puzzle is horizontal), but misses symmetry (e.g., example 2 has mirrored rows for 3/8/9).
 * Function flip_l3 is broken for l=3 cases where adjacents match (flips middle to them, creating breaks; should fill run to adj instead). flip_l4 under-applies (only if both adj same, but doesn't chain to longer runs). flip_l2 over-applies, breaking pairs prematurely.
 * extract_objects not present/attempted; a run-extractor (like above) would help identify fillable regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a noisy, alternating mess of 8's, 3's, and scattered 1/2/4/9's with short runs (e.g., row 2: [8,3,8,3,...] repeating pairs), whereas training examples suggest solid horizontal fills of 3? (likely the "2" equivalent here) between 8-borders, with preserved vertical dotted lines of 1's and grouped blocks for 4/9 (e.g., expected probably long 3-runs in even rows, dotted 1's untouched, paired 4's, and symmetric 9's). This matches the attempt's splitting error, fragmenting what should be uniform stripes; it ignores the pattern of input (repeating 3/8 motifs) to build wider fills, and over-flips edges (e.g., many 3,8,3 instead of 3,3,3 or similar). Unknown why 2's appear in odd places (e.g., row 3 has 2's inserted), but likely from l2/l3 misfires on input runs.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subinner: List[int], c: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(subinner)
    while i < n:
        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

```python
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    n = len(subinner)
    if n == 0:
        return None
    u = g_val + 1
    best_dist = float('inf')
    best_preserved = -1
    best_shift = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    for shift in range(u):
        pattern = [0] * n
        for ii in range(n):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 14:56:15] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a 2D grid (likely representing a partially filled image or pattern with numeric "colors") by identifying vertical "wall" columns fully occupied by a background value (s, often 8), then filling the spaces between walls in each row with either solid dominant colors or periodic patterns based on predefined periods for specific colors (1,3,4,8,9), while ignoring or skipping certain values like 2 (possibly placeholders or errors) and ensuring majority dominance.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns where EVERY row has the background value s; partial walls (e.g., 8s in some but not all rows) do not qualify and should not be treated as boundaries.
 * Between walls, shrink the fillable region if the immediate side cells (istart and iend) match a non-s, non-2 color, treating them as fixed "frames" to avoid overwriting structural elements.
 * Dominant color detection ignores s and 2 values, requires >50% majority of non-ignored cells, and only considers valid colors {1,3,4,8,9}; if no dominant, skip filling that segment.
 * Patterns are periodic with fixed periods per color (e.g., 1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2), consisting of (p-1) instances of the color followed by one s (background for separation?); choose the phase that maximizes matches to the current row segment.
 * Compare periodic pattern matches to solid fills of the dominant color, applying whichever fits better (higher match count); this handles cases where the row is already mostly solid vs. patterned.
 * 2 values seem to act as "unknown" or "to-be-filled" placeholders that are skipped in analysis but should be overwritten during filling if they fall in the segment—persisting 2s indicate incomplete filling or mismatched segments.
 * Grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) are always treated as implicit walls.
 * Processing is row-by-row and segment-by-segment, modifying a copy of the grid; no vertical or global consistency enforcement across rows, which might miss multi-row patterns.
 * Subtle: Patterns cycle with phase shift, so alignment matters; solid fill can override if it matches more, but this might over-simplify irregular segments.
 * Potential miss: If a segment has mixed valid colors without >50% dominance, it skips, leaving 2s or originals intact—could lead to incomplete grids.
 * Periods are hardcoded and color-specific, implying the puzzle has predefined "textures" (e.g., 3 might be a dotted pattern with period 3).
 * No handling for horizontal walls or 2D connectivity; assumes independent row fills.
 * s is dynamically set from g[0][0], assuming uniform background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies vertical wall columns (all rows == s), adds edges; useful for segmenting the grid horizontally.
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```

```python
def get_dominant_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    # Extracts non-s, non-2 values in a row segment, finds majority color if >50% and in valid set {1,3,4,8,9}.
    # Key for deciding what to fill; ignores 2s correctly but skips if no strong dominant.
    vals = [g[r][j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] != s and g[r][j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    cnt = Counter(vals)
    most_c, count = cnt.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5 and most_c in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most_c
    return -1
```

```python
def get_periodic_pattern(c: int, p: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    # Generates a repeating pattern for a color with period p (e.g., [c, s] for p=2); essential for textured fills.
    return [c] * (p - 1) + [s]
```

```python
def get_best_phase(g: List[List[int]], r: int, istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], p: int) -> int:
    # Tries all phases of the pattern to find the best fit (max matches) in the segment; returns phase and match count.
    # Note: The provided code returns a tuple, but usage expects two values—fixed in implementation.
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(p):
        matches = sum(1 for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] == pattern[(j - istart + phase) % p])
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase, best_matches
```

```python
# Solid and pattern application functions (apply_solid, apply_pattern) are helpful for modifying segments directly.
# period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2} is a useful hardcoded mapping for color-to-period.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but get_solid_matches and the phase function assume exact matches including to s in patterns—might overcount if 2s are present, as they won't match c or s but aren't skipped in matching logic. No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-s, non-2); the code treats rows independently, which may not capture 2D shapes—future attempts might need blob extraction for vertical alignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating solid handling of wall detection, dominant color selection, and pattern/solid choice for simpler cases.
 * Worked well for cases with clear vertical walls and uniform row segments, as evidenced by correct training outputs.
 * What worked: Accurate wall finding (includes edges), dominant color with >50% threshold prevents false fills, phase selection maximizes fit, comparison to solid fill chooses better option, side-frame shrinking preserves boundaries.
 * What didn't work: In complex tests, 2s persist in output (e.g., positions like columns 3-4 in several rows), suggesting segments containing 2s either skipped (no dominant) or patterns didn't overwrite them effectively—unknown why, possibly because 2s dilute dominance or segments are too narrow/mixed.
 * Missed potential vertical consistency: Fills are per-row, but test output shows repeating row patterns (e.g., every 3 rows similar), hinting at multi-row objects that need cross-row propagation.
 * Side matching skips too aggressively if istart/iend are 2s (not handled, as side check is !=s and equal), potentially leaving narrow segments unfilled.
 * No handling for 8 as a fillable color in patterns (period 4), but test has many 8s—might over-apply solids.
 * Training successes suggest core segmentation and filling logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in mixed/2-heavy segments.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies major walls (e.g., edges all 8s, some internal full-8 columns implied), fills many segments with patterns (e.g., repeating 3s in row 1 between walls, 1-8-1 patterns around columns 9-12, 4-8-4 or solid 4s around 16-19, 9-8-9 later), and shows repetition across rows (e.g., rows 2-4, 6-8 similar with 2s in cols 3-4, 1s in 9-12, etc.), suggesting it's rendering a multi-row image like letters or icons.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Persistent 2s in specific positions (e.g., rows 3,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,19,21,22,24,25: columns 3-4 often 2,2; row 24 has 8,2 in col 3) indicate unfilled or skipped areas—these should likely be overwritten by patterns/solids if in valid segments, but weren't, possibly because 2s prevent dominance (>50% fails) or segments exclude them via side logic.
 * Repetitive structure (e.g., every other row has 8,8,8 in cols 3-5 vs. 2,2) looks like an attempt to draw shapes (perhaps "E" or bars with 3/1/4/9), but inconsistencies like row 24's partial 2 suggest incomplete processing—expected output should eliminate all 2s for a clean pattern.
 * Solid fills appear in places (e.g., row 1 all 8s outside, 3s in segments), but patterned areas have s=8 insertions that might disrupt if phase is wrong; test has many such, but if expected is smoother solids, this over-applies patterns.
 * Overall, output is better than raw input (assuming input had more 2s), but lingering 2s and row variations without vertical alignment mean it's not matching a coherent final image—needs better 2-handling or cross-row logic to fix.

[2025-10-03 14:56:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:00:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where rows represent patterns to be "resolved" or filled by adjusting blocks of a specific value S (non-background, non-border numbers like 1,3,8,9) based on the most common consecutive block length K of S in the inner row (excluding borders), while preserving border patterns of 2's and background B (like 4 or 8). The goal is to standardize S blocks to match K by splitting excess triples, filling gaps between S blocks proportionally or based on adjacent block sizes, and handling special end-of-row cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are fixed: Positions 0 and width-1 are always B; inner borders at 1 and width-2 are often 2's that should not be changed unless part of a specific rule, and rows with all-inner-2's or all-B are skipped.
 * S is dynamically chosen from unique inner values excluding B and 2; multiple S per row are processed sequentially, but only if K > 0 (i.e., S appears in blocks).
 * Core rule: Compute K as the mode (most common) length of consecutive S blocks in positions 2 to width-3; if no blocks, skip S.
 * Splitting: Any triple (or more) of S has the middle set to B to break into smaller blocks closer to K.
 * Gap filling: For double non-S gaps between S blocks, fill one side based on adjacent block sizes vs. K (prefer filling the side with smaller adjacent block; if equal, bias left or right); for triple non-S gaps flanked by S, fill the middle one.
 * End specials: Handle near-end doubles of S by setting the last to B; special case for non-S double followed by S double near end with trailing 2, by swapping/adjusting to S and B.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—split triples first, then fill gaps; avoid changing borders (1 < pos < width-1 only); K is only from inner blocks (start=2, end=width-3), ignoring potential edge blocks; rows with uniform inner 2's are skipped even if they have S elsewhere; multiple S types per row (e.g., 1 and 3 in same grid) are handled separately but may interact if positions overlap; all-B rows are unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Mode K ignores singletons or non-consecutive; gap filling considers full adjacent block sizes (chaining left/right from gap); special end rule only if width >=7 and exact pattern match; after filling, new blocks may not trigger re-computation of K (one-pass per row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Grids have repeating row patterns (e.g., every 5 rows: full B, 2-border, pattern, pattern, 2-border); test grid is wider (29 cols vs. 22), with mixed S (1,3,4,9) and 2's inside patterns; vertical alignment suggests column-wise consistency, but rules are row-only; 2's can appear mid-pattern (e.g., as separators or unfilled gaps) and should remain unless explicitly filled to S.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_mode_block_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, S: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the most common block length of consecutive S in row[start:end+1].
    Returns 0 if no blocks found. Useful for determining K per S type.
    """
    blocks = []
    j = start
    while j <= end:
        if row[j] == S:
            size = 0
            while j <= end and row[j] == S:
                size += 1
                j += 1
            blocks.append(size)
        else:
            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The above function is helpful and correctly extracts block modes, used in the main program for K. No other types or tools from attempts; the main program loop is a basic row processor but needs refinement for gap logic and end cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it correctly handled training example 1 (likely a simpler pattern with consistent filling).
 * Failed training example 2: For 8's in rows 12-14, generated split some triples (e.g., row 12 has 8,4,8,8,8 instead of expected 8,4,8,8,8—wait, actually mismatched by not filling enough to make consistent triples of 3, leaving isolated 8's and 4's where expected has merged 8,8,8 blocks separated by single 4's; specifically, positions like 4-6 should be 8,8,8 but generated 4,8,8,8; similar under-filling in later groups). For 9's in rows 17-19, no filling occurred at all (generated keeps 9,4,9 patterns unchanged, but expected also unchanged—wait, expected matches generated for 9's, so failure is isolated to 8's where mode K=3 was not fully applied to gaps). Overall, splitting worked partially, but gap filling logic (double/triple non-S) was incomplete or miscalculated adjacent sizes, leading to asymmetric or missed fills.
 * extract_objects not present or relevant (no object extraction; puzzle is block-based, not blob/object detection—don't use in future).
 * The special end double non-S double S rule fired incorrectly or not at all in some rows, as seen in partial matches.
 * Mode computation skipped edges correctly but may have missed chaining in gap size calc (e.g., left_size/right_size while loops are good but conditionals for change_pos are buggy, preferring wrong side when sizes equal or <K).
 * Train 2 mismatches in 8's for unknown reason in exact gap positions (e.g., expected row 13 has 8,8,8,4,8,8,8 but generated 8,8,8,4,8,4,8—inserted extra 4's or failed to fill).
 * Triple split rule over-applied or under-applied in dense areas, creating unintended small blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply partial splitting and minimal filling, leaving many irregular patterns unfilled (e.g., row 2 has 3,8,3,8 patterns but expected likely standardizes 3-blocks to a mode K, perhaps filling gaps to triples like in train 2's 8's; instead, it keeps scattered 3's with 8's as B). 
 * In rows with 1's (e.g., row 3: 3,8,1,8,8,3), no apparent filling of gaps around 1's, and 2's mid-row (e.g., 2,2 near pos 3-4) remain but may need S-fill if part of gap; expected probably merges 1's into consistent blocks separated by B.
 * 4's and 9's show uneven treatment: row 5 has 4,8,4,4 but scattered; 9's in later rows (e.g., row 5: 9,9) partially filled but not to mode (test has many 9,8,9,8 patterns unchanged, suggesting K=1 mode not triggering fills, but likely K=2 or more from context). 
 * Overall, output retains too much original irregularity (e.g., vertical columns don't align to consistent block patterns as in expected train 2), with 2's inside possibly unfilled gaps; it makes sense as a partial application but not correct, missing proportional gap fills and full standardization per S (e.g., 3's should likely be triples like train 2's 3's/8's). 
 * To handle test, need better multi-S interaction (e.g., 4's seem like another S, but program treats as possible S only if not B/2— in test B=8, so 4 is S but underfilled) and wider grid edge cases (width=29, more room for complex gaps).

[2025-10-03 15:00:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....

[2025-10-03 15:05:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based floor plan with walls (likely value 8), floors (likely value 3), and enclosed rooms containing tile patterns that are partially corrupted or inconsistent; the goal is to detect rooms and correct their internal patterns to a consistent repeating motif of a dominant color (C) in groups of size K followed by a single wall tile (W), using the minimal-difference phase-shifted periodic pattern that best fits the existing tiles.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are detected by finding columns with value W (8) in the floor row (row 1), assuming vertical symmetry and consistent wall positions across the grid height.
 * Rooms are segments between consecutive wall columns, excluding leading/trailing floor tiles (F=3) to focus on the "pattern segment"; borders (rows 0, h-2, h-1) and floor (row 1) are skipped to avoid modifying structural elements.
 * A room is only processed if its pattern segment uses exactly one non-W/non-F color (C); multiple colors cause skipping, which misses corrupted rooms needing unification.
 * Group sizes of consecutive C tiles in the segment are computed; the most frequent size K is used to define the period p = K + 1 (K C's + 1 W), and phase shifts (s from 0 to p-1) are tested to find the repeating pattern minimizing mismatches (diffs) with the current row.
 * Correction is applied only if it improves the row (min_diff > 0), but the code requires the expected first tile to match the actual first tile in the segment for a phase to be considered, which may overly restrict valid fits.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a room share the same pattern logic independently (no vertical alignment or multi-row consistency enforced), and patterns are horizontal-only per row.
 * Easy to miss: Floor row (row 1) has mixed F and W, used solely for wall detection; top/bottom borders are all W; rooms may have initial F padding; if no groups of C or multiple K frequencies, no correction happens.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns must repeat with exact period, but code allows only the most frequent K (or ties), potentially missing blended or evolving patterns; no handling for vertical propagation or room-wide color dominance beyond single-color check; assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

# Core logic for wall detection (helpful for identifying room boundaries consistently)
def detect_walls(grid: List[List[int]], floor_row: int = 1, w_val: int = 8) -> List[int]:
    w = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return sorted([j for j in range(w) if grid[floor_row][j] == w_val])
```

```python
# Pattern fitting logic (helpful for computing minimal-diff repeating pattern)
def fit_pattern(row_segment: List[int], c_val: int, k: int, w_val: int = 8) -> tuple[int, List[int]]:
    l = len(row_segment)
    p = k + 1
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    first_val = row_segment[0]
    for s in range(p):
        exp_first_pos = s % p
        exp_first = c_val if exp_first_pos < k else w_val
        if exp_first != first_val:
            continue
        this_diff = 0
        this_pattern = []
        for ii in range(l):
            pos = (ii + s) % p
            exp = c_val if pos < k else w_val
            if exp != row_segment[ii]:
                this_diff += 1
            this_pattern.append(exp)
        if this_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = this_diff
            best_pattern = this_pattern
    return min_diff, best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous program correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 by identifying single-color rooms, computing dominant K, and applying phase-shifted corrections where diffs > 0, resulting in uniform repeating patterns.
 * Worked well for rooms with exactly one C and clear group frequencies, enforcing periodicity without over-modifying borders or floors.
 * Did not work for test input: Skipped rooms with multiple colors (e.g., mixes of 1, 2, 4, 9 alongside potential C), leaving uncorrected inconsistencies like scattered 1s, 4s, and irregular 2/9 placements.
 * Phase restriction (matching first tile) may have blocked valid patterns in test rows with offset starts or leading non-C tiles.
 * No vertical consistency check, so horizontal fixes per row don't align rooms across heights, potentially missing global puzzle symmetry.
 * Counter for group sizes is helpful but only uses most frequent K; ties in frequency are handled by trying all, but blended rooms (multiple K) are ignored.
 * Wall detection from floor row is essential and correct, but assumes all walls align perfectly vertically, which holds in training but may not in more complex tests.
 * Single-color check (len(room_colors) != 1) is too strict for initialization/mixed states; training likely had pre-unified colors, but test has artifacts (1,2,4,9) needing merging to a dominant C.
 * No extraction of full objects/rooms as multi-row entities; per-row processing misses subtle vertical patterns or shared corrections.
 * The full program function is mostly helpful but broken for multi-color rooms (skips entirely) and not relevant for vertical or color-unification steps (don't reuse without fixes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to be the input grid with minimal or no changes, as rooms still contain multiple inconsistent colors (e.g., 1s and 4s in what should be unified patterns, 2s and 9s in irregular groups) instead of enforced repeating C-W motifs.
 * Specific differences: In rows like the third (index 2), output has [..., 3, 1, 8, 1, 8, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 3, ...] with scattered 1s and partial 4s, but expected would be uniform groups of a single C (e.g., all 4s in K=4 runs separated by 8s) across the room segment; similar issues in rows 4-28 with 9s misplaced (e.g., [..., 9, 9, 8, ...] vs. expected periodic 9-8 without breaks).
 * Patterns are not periodic: Group sizes vary (e.g., two 2s together, then singles), and no corrections applied, suggesting the single-color filter failed entirely for test rooms, leaving "corrupted" tiles intact.
 * Borders and floors remain unchanged (all 8s top/bottom, 3s with 8s in row 1), which is correct, but internal rooms show no improvement, unlike training where full uniformity was achieved.
 * Overall, output lacks the clean, repeating structure expected (e.g., no consistent K=3 or K=4 C blocks per room); it looks like raw input, indicating the program didn't engage correction logic for the test's complexity.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 15:05:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color manipulation, where the goal appears to be simplifying or extending horizontal runs of colors into solid, uniform stripes or filled regions (e.g., long sequences of the same non-background color like 2's, 3's, or 8's) while preserving certain patterned elements (e.g., vertical or dotted lines of 1's) and respecting boundaries defined by the background color (e.g., 3 in example 1, 4 in example 2, 8 in test). The rules seem to focus on "growing" or "filling" inward from edges or patterns, but the current approach treats it as breaking runs via flips, which inverts the intent.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal filling: Expected outputs show long, continuous horizontal runs of the same color (e.g., rows of all 2's spanning nearly the full width between borders in training examples), suggesting rules for extending colors across gaps or runs rather than splitting them.
 * Background/border color is invariant (e.g., all 3's in example 1 top/bottom, all 4's in example 2 borders, all 8's in test borders), and inner regions are filled solidly except for preserved "features" like vertical lines of 1's or grouped patterns (e.g., pairs or triples of 3's/8's/9's in example 2).
 * Subtle elements: Alternating or short runs (e.g., 2,4,2) in input should resolve to solid fills (e.g., all 2's), but only horizontally—vertical consistency is maintained for special colors like 1 (dotted lines) or 3/8/9 (which form symmetric or repeating blocks). Adjacent colors influence flips/extensions, but only if they match on both sides for symmetry (e.g., in l3/l4 rules, but reversed: extend rather than split).
 * Runs longer than 1-2 should be "absorbed" into neighboring fills if they match the edge color, but isolated patterns (e.g., single 1's in vertical lines) are preserved without alteration.
 * Chaining effects: Applying rules in sequence (l2 then l3 then l4 then l2) can propagate changes, but the current implementation breaks chains instead of building them, leading to fragmentation.
 * Edge cases: No left/right neighbors means no flip (preserve run); vertical interactions are minimal, but horizontal scans must avoid overwriting preserved vertical features (e.g., 1's stay as-is).
 * Overall, the puzzle likely simulates "flood fill" or "region growing" from borders inward, stopping at barriers (e.g., 1's or mismatched colors), but with specific rules for run lengths to decide absorption vs. preservation.
 * Missable subtlety: In example 2, 3's form 2-wide horizontal groups separated by 4's, suggesting paired runs are preserved/merged horizontally if symmetric, but singles are not; similarly for 8's (3-wide groups) and 9's (singles remain dotted).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions attempt to model run-splitting rules but are inverted for the puzzle's filling intent; they could be adapted by reversing flips (e.g., extend run instead of break). No custom types are defined, but a run-finder helper would be useful.

```python
import copy
from typing import List, Optional

def find_horizontal_runs(row: List[int], min_length: int = 2) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Helper to extract runs: returns list of (start_index, length, color) for runs >= min_length.
    Useful for identifying what to fill/extend without scanning every triplet/quad."""
    runs = []
    n = len(row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i + min_length - 1 < n:
            c = row[i]
            length = 1
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == c:
                length += 1
                j += 1
            if length >= min_length:
                runs.append((i, length, c))
            i = j
        else:
            break
    return runs
```

```python
def extend_to_adjacent(g: List[List[int]], target_color: int, background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Prototype for filling: For each row, extend target_color runs towards background borders if adjacent.
    Not fully implemented; useful starting point for reversing split logic."""
    h = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(g)):
        row = g[r]
        n = len(row)
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if row[i] == target_color and row[i-1] == background and row[i+1] == background:
                h[r][i] = background  # Wait, no—invert to fill: if short run between same adj, extend adj into it.
                # Actual: if adj same and != run color, fill run with adj color.
    return h
```

The flip_l2, flip_l3, flip_l4 functions are partially helpful as a framework for scanning runs but are broken in direction (they split instead of merge/fill), leading to incorrect fragmentation; do not reuse without inverting the flip logic (e.g., change h[r][i+1] = left_c to extend left_c leftward/rightward). The program composer is unhelpful as-is since order matters but current sequence creates chains of breaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies the need for horizontal run processing (l2/l3/l4) and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, but fails to create solid fills—instead, it scatters colors (e.g., in train 1, generates [3,2,3,2,3,...] vs. expected [3,2,2,2,...] long 2's).
 * What worked: Basic scanning for equal runs (e.g., detects l2/l3/l4 accurately) and conditional flips based on adjacents (e.g., only if left != c); the final l2 pass handles some chaining.
 * What didn't: Core misunderstanding—rules split runs (e.g., flipping middle/end to adjacent) when the puzzle wants to merge/extend them (e.g., train 1 row 1 expected all 2's from short 2's, but generated alternates 2/3; train 2 row 2 generated short 2's and scattered 4's vs. expected long 2's). In train 2, 3's/8's/9's are not grouped correctly (e.g., generated single 3's and 4-interrupted 8's vs. expected paired/tripled groups like [3,3] or [8,8,8]).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Row 1/3 have broken 2-runs with inserted 3's (e.g., generated [3,2,3,2,...] due to l3 flipping right end to left 3, but expected ignores borders and fills all inner to 2); row 2 preserves 1's correctly but doesn't affect fills.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper sections generate dotted 3/4/2 patterns instead of solid 2's and grouped 3's (e.g., row 2: generated [4,2,4,2,...] vs. expected [4,2,2,2,...]); lower sections fail to merge 8's into 3-wide (e.g., row 12: generated scattered 8/4 vs. expected [8,4,8,8,8,...]); 1's preserved but 9's not dotted correctly.
 * No vertical processing, which is fine (puzzle is horizontal), but misses symmetry (e.g., example 2 has mirrored rows for 3/8/9).
 * Function flip_l3 is broken for l=3 cases where adjacents match (flips middle to them, creating breaks; should fill run to adj instead). flip_l4 under-applies (only if both adj same, but doesn't chain to longer runs). flip_l2 over-applies, breaking pairs prematurely.
 * extract_objects not present/attempted; a run-extractor (like above) would help identify fillable regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a noisy, alternating mess of 8's, 3's, and scattered 1/2/4/9's with short runs (e.g., row 2: [8,3,8,3,...] repeating pairs), whereas training examples suggest solid horizontal fills of 3? (likely the "2" equivalent here) between 8-borders, with preserved vertical dotted lines of 1's and grouped blocks for 4/9 (e.g., expected probably long 3-runs in even rows, dotted 1's untouched, paired 4's, and symmetric 9's). This matches the attempt's splitting error, fragmenting what should be uniform stripes; it ignores the pattern of input (repeating 3/8 motifs) to build wider fills, and over-flips edges (e.g., many 3,8,3 instead of 3,3,3 or similar). Unknown why 2's appear in odd places (e.g., row 3 has 2's inserted), but likely from l2/l3 misfires on input runs.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where rows represent patterns to be "resolved" or filled by adjusting blocks of a specific value S (non-background, non-border numbers like 1,3,8,9) based on the most common consecutive block length K of S in the inner row (excluding borders), while preserving border patterns of 2's and background B (like 4 or 8). The goal is to standardize S blocks to match K by splitting excess triples, filling gaps between S blocks proportionally or based on adjacent block sizes, and handling special end-of-row cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are fixed: Positions 0 and width-1 are always B; inner borders at 1 and width-2 are often 2's that should not be changed unless part of a specific rule, and rows with all-inner-2's or all-B are skipped.
 * S is dynamically chosen from unique inner values excluding B and 2; multiple S per row are processed sequentially, but only if K > 0 (i.e., S appears in blocks).
 * Core rule: Compute K as the mode (most common) length of consecutive S blocks in positions 2 to width-3; if no blocks, skip S.
 * Splitting: Any triple (or more) of S has the middle set to B to break into smaller blocks closer to K.
 * Gap filling: For double non-S gaps between S blocks, fill one side based on adjacent block sizes vs. K (prefer filling the side with smaller adjacent block; if equal, bias left or right); for triple non-S gaps flanked by S, fill the middle one.
 * End specials: Handle near-end doubles of S by setting the last to B; special case for non-S double followed by S double near end with trailing 2, by swapping/adjusting to S and B.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—split triples first, then fill gaps; avoid changing borders (1 < pos < width-1 only); K is only from inner blocks (start=2, end=width-3), ignoring potential edge blocks; rows with uniform inner 2's are skipped even if they have S elsewhere; multiple S types per row (e.g., 1 and 3 in same grid) are handled separately but may interact if positions overlap; all-B rows are unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Mode K ignores singletons or non-consecutive; gap filling considers full adjacent block sizes (chaining left/right from gap); special end rule only if width >=7 and exact pattern match; after filling, new blocks may not trigger re-computation of K (one-pass per row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Grids have repeating row patterns (e.g., every 5 rows: full B, 2-border, pattern, pattern, 2-border); test grid is wider (29 cols vs. 22), with mixed S (1,3,4,9) and 2's inside patterns; vertical alignment suggests column-wise consistency, but rules are row-only; 2's can appear mid-pattern (e.g., as separators or unfilled gaps) and should remain unless explicitly filled to S.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_mode_block_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, S: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the most common block length of consecutive S in row[start:end+1].
    Returns 0 if no blocks found. Useful for determining K per S type.
    """
    blocks = []
    j = start
    while j <= end:
        if row[j] == S:
            size = 0
            while j <= end and row[j] == S:
                size += 1
                j += 1
            blocks.append(size)
        else:
            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The above function is helpful and correctly extracts block modes, used in the main program for K. No other types or tools from attempts; the main program loop is a basic row processor but needs refinement for gap logic and end cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it correctly handled training example 1 (likely a simpler pattern with consistent filling).
 * Failed training example 2: For 8's in rows 12-14, generated split some triples (e.g., row 12 has 8,4,8,8,8 instead of expected 8,4,8,8,8—wait, actually mismatched by not filling enough to make consistent triples of 3, leaving isolated 8's and 4's where expected has merged 8,8,8 blocks separated by single 4's; specifically, positions like 4-6 should be 8,8,8 but generated 4,8,8,8; similar under-filling in later groups). For 9's in rows 17-19, no filling occurred at all (generated keeps 9,4,9 patterns unchanged, but expected also unchanged—wait, expected matches generated for 9's, so failure is isolated to 8's where mode K=3 was not fully applied to gaps). Overall, splitting worked partially, but gap filling logic (double/triple non-S) was incomplete or miscalculated adjacent sizes, leading to asymmetric or missed fills.
 * extract_objects not present or relevant (no object extraction; puzzle is block-based, not blob/object detection—don't use in future).
 * The special end double non-S double S rule fired incorrectly or not at all in some rows, as seen in partial matches.
 * Mode computation skipped edges correctly but may have missed chaining in gap size calc (e.g., left_size/right_size while loops are good but conditionals for change_pos are buggy, preferring wrong side when sizes equal or <K).
 * Train 2 mismatches in 8's for unknown reason in exact gap positions (e.g., expected row 13 has 8,8,8,4,8,8,8 but generated 8,8,8,4,8,4,8—inserted extra 4's or failed to fill).
 * Triple split rule over-applied or under-applied in dense areas, creating unintended small blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply partial splitting and minimal filling, leaving many irregular patterns unfilled (e.g., row 2 has 3,8,3,8 patterns but expected likely standardizes 3-blocks to a mode K, perhaps filling gaps to triples like in train 2's 8's; instead, it keeps scattered 3's with 8's as B). 
 * In rows with 1's (e.g., row 3: 3,8,1,8,8,3), no apparent filling of gaps around 1's, and 2's mid-row (e.g., 2,2 near pos 3-4) remain but may need S-fill if part of gap; expected probably merges 1's into consistent blocks separated by B.
 * 4's and 9's show uneven treatment: row 5 has 4,8,4,4 but scattered; 9's in later rows (e.g., row 5: 9,9) partially filled but not to mode (test has many 9,8,9,8 patterns unchanged, suggesting K=1 mode not triggering fills, but likely K=2 or more from context). 
 * Overall, output retains too much original irregularity (e.g., vertical columns don't align to consistent block patterns as in expected train 2), with 2's inside possibly unfilled gaps; it makes sense as a partial application but not correct, missing proportional gap fills and full standardization per S (e.g., 3's should likely be triples like train 2's 3's/8's). 
 * To handle test, need better multi-S interaction (e.g., 4's seem like another S, but program treats as possible S only if not B/2— in test B=8, so 4 is S but underfilled) and wider grid edge cases (width=29, more room for complex gaps).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based floor plan with walls (likely value 8), floors (likely value 3), and enclosed rooms containing tile patterns that are partially corrupted or inconsistent; the goal is to detect rooms and correct their internal patterns to a consistent repeating motif of a dominant color (C) in groups of size K followed by a single wall tile (W), using the minimal-difference phase-shifted periodic pattern that best fits the existing tiles.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are detected by finding columns with value W (8) in the floor row (row 1), assuming vertical symmetry and consistent wall positions across the grid height.
 * Rooms are segments between consecutive wall columns, excluding leading/trailing floor tiles (F=3) to focus on the "pattern segment"; borders (rows 0, h-2, h-1) and floor (row 1) are skipped to avoid modifying structural elements.
 * A room is only processed if its pattern segment uses exactly one non-W/non-F color (C); multiple colors cause skipping, which misses corrupted rooms needing unification.
 * Group sizes of consecutive C tiles in the segment are computed; the most frequent size K is used to define the period p = K + 1 (K C's + 1 W), and phase shifts (s from 0 to p-1) are tested to find the repeating pattern minimizing mismatches (diffs) with the current row.
 * Correction is applied only if it improves the row (min_diff > 0), but the code requires the expected first tile to match the actual first tile in the segment for a phase to be considered, which may overly restrict valid fits.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a room share the same pattern logic independently (no vertical alignment or multi-row consistency enforced), and patterns are horizontal-only per row.
 * Easy to miss: Floor row (row 1) has mixed F and W, used solely for wall detection; top/bottom borders are all W; rooms may have initial F padding; if no groups of C or multiple K frequencies, no correction happens.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns must repeat with exact period, but code allows only the most frequent K (or ties), potentially missing blended or evolving patterns; no handling for vertical propagation or room-wide color dominance beyond single-color check; assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            this_pattern.append(exp)
        if this_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = this_diff
            best_pattern = this_pattern
    return min_diff, best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous program correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 by identifying single-color rooms, computing dominant K, and applying phase-shifted corrections where diffs > 0, resulting in uniform repeating patterns.
 * Worked well for rooms with exactly one C and clear group frequencies, enforcing periodicity without over-modifying borders or floors.
 * Did not work for test input: Skipped rooms with multiple colors (e.g., mixes of 1, 2, 4, 9 alongside potential C), leaving uncorrected inconsistencies like scattered 1s, 4s, and irregular 2/9 placements.
 * Phase restriction (matching first tile) may have blocked valid patterns in test rows with offset starts or leading non-C tiles.
 * No vertical consistency check, so horizontal fixes per row don't align rooms across heights, potentially missing global puzzle symmetry.
 * Counter for group sizes is helpful but only uses most frequent K; ties in frequency are handled by trying all, but blended rooms (multiple K) are ignored.
 * Wall detection from floor row is essential and correct, but assumes all walls align perfectly vertically, which holds in training but may not in more complex tests.
 * Single-color check (len(room_colors) != 1) is too strict for initialization/mixed states; training likely had pre-unified colors, but test has artifacts (1,2,4,9) needing merging to a dominant C.
 * No extraction of full objects/rooms as multi-row entities; per-row processing misses subtle vertical patterns or shared corrections.
 * The full program function is mostly helpful but broken for multi-color rooms (skips entirely) and not relevant for vertical or color-unification steps (don't reuse without fixes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to be the input grid with minimal or no changes, as rooms still contain multiple inconsistent colors (e.g., 1s and 4s in what should be unified patterns, 2s and 9s in irregular groups) instead of enforced repeating C-W motifs.
 * Specific differences: In rows like the third (index 2), output has [..., 3, 1, 8, 1, 8, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 3, ...] with scattered 1s and partial 4s, but expected would be uniform groups of a single C (e.g., all 4s in K=4 runs separated by 8s) across the room segment; similar issues in rows 4-28 with 9s misplaced (e.g., [..., 9, 9, 8, ...] vs. expected periodic 9-8 without breaks).
 * Patterns are not periodic: Group sizes vary (e.g., two 2s together, then singles), and no corrections applied, suggesting the single-color filter failed entirely for test rooms, leaving "corrupted" tiles intact.
 * Borders and floors remain unchanged (all 8s top/bottom, 3s with 8s in row 1), which is correct, but internal rooms show no improvement, unlike training where full uniformity was achieved.
 * Overall, output lacks the clean, repeating structure expected (e.g., no consistent K=3 or K=4 C blocks per room); it looks like raw input, indicating the program didn't engage correction logic for the test's complexity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s

        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]

    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:

                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subinner: List[int], c: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(subinner)
    while i < n:
        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

```python
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    n = len(subinner)
    if n == 0:
        return None

        for ii in range(n):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a 2D grid (likely representing a partially filled image or pattern with numeric "colors") by identifying vertical "wall" columns fully occupied by a background value (s, often 8), then filling the spaces between walls in each row with either solid dominant colors or periodic patterns based on predefined periods for specific colors (1,3,4,8,9), while ignoring or skipping certain values like 2 (possibly placeholders or errors) and ensuring majority dominance.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns where EVERY row has the background value s; partial walls (e.g., 8s in some but not all rows) do not qualify and should not be treated as boundaries.
 * Between walls, shrink the fillable region if the immediate side cells (istart and iend) match a non-s, non-2 color, treating them as fixed "frames" to avoid overwriting structural elements.
 * Dominant color detection ignores s and 2 values, requires >50% majority of non-ignored cells, and only considers valid colors {1,3,4,8,9}; if no dominant, skip filling that segment.
 * Patterns are periodic with fixed periods per color (e.g., 1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2), consisting of (p-1) instances of the color followed by one s (background for separation?); choose the phase that maximizes matches to the current row segment.
 * Compare periodic pattern matches to solid fills of the dominant color, applying whichever fits better (higher match count); this handles cases where the row is already mostly solid vs. patterned.
 * 2 values seem to act as "unknown" or "to-be-filled" placeholders that are skipped in analysis but should be overwritten during filling if they fall in the segment—persisting 2s indicate incomplete filling or mismatched segments.
 * Grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) are always treated as implicit walls.
 * Processing is row-by-row and segment-by-segment, modifying a copy of the grid; no vertical or global consistency enforcement across rows, which might miss multi-row patterns.
 * Subtle: Patterns cycle with phase shift, so alignment matters; solid fill can override if it matches more, but this might over-simplify irregular segments.
 * Potential miss: If a segment has mixed valid colors without >50% dominance, it skips, leaving 2s or originals intact—could lead to incomplete grids.
 * Periods are hardcoded and color-specific, implying the puzzle has predefined "textures" (e.g., 3 might be a dotted pattern with period 3).
 * No handling for horizontal walls or 2D connectivity; assumes independent row fills.
 * s is dynamically set from g[0][0], assuming uniform background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies vertical wall columns (all rows == s), adds edges; useful for segmenting the grid horizontally.
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```

```python
def get_dominant_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    # Extracts non-s, non-2 values in a row segment, finds majority color if >50% and in valid set {1,3,4,8,9}.
    # Key for deciding what to fill; ignores 2s correctly but skips if no strong dominant.
    vals = [g[r][j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] != s and g[r][j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    cnt = Counter(vals)
    most_c, count = cnt.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5 and most_c in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most_c
    return -1
```

```python
def get_periodic_pattern(c: int, p: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    # Generates a repeating pattern for a color with period p (e.g., [c, s] for p=2); essential for textured fills.
    return [c] * (p - 1) + [s]
```

```python
def get_best_phase(g: List[List[int]], r: int, istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], p: int) -> int:
    # Tries all phases of the pattern to find the best fit (max matches) in the segment; returns phase and match count.
    # Note: The provided code returns a tuple, but usage expects two values—fixed in implementation.
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(p):
        matches = sum(1 for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] == pattern[(j - istart + phase) % p])
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase, best_matches
```

```python
# Solid and pattern application functions (apply_solid, apply_pattern) are helpful for modifying segments directly.
# period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2} is a useful hardcoded mapping for color-to-period.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but get_solid_matches and the phase function assume exact matches including to s in patterns—might overcount if 2s are present, as they won't match c or s but aren't skipped in matching logic. No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-s, non-2); the code treats rows independently, which may not capture 2D shapes—future attempts might need blob extraction for vertical alignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating solid handling of wall detection, dominant color selection, and pattern/solid choice for simpler cases.
 * Worked well for cases with clear vertical walls and uniform row segments, as evidenced by correct training outputs.
 * What worked: Accurate wall finding (includes edges), dominant color with >50% threshold prevents false fills, phase selection maximizes fit, comparison to solid fill chooses better option, side-frame shrinking preserves boundaries.
 * What didn't work: In complex tests, 2s persist in output (e.g., positions like columns 3-4 in several rows), suggesting segments containing 2s either skipped (no dominant) or patterns didn't overwrite them effectively—unknown why, possibly because 2s dilute dominance or segments are too narrow/mixed.
 * Missed potential vertical consistency: Fills are per-row, but test output shows repeating row patterns (e.g., every 3 rows similar), hinting at multi-row objects that need cross-row propagation.
 * Side matching skips too aggressively if istart/iend are 2s (not handled, as side check is !=s and equal), potentially leaving narrow segments unfilled.
 * No handling for 8 as a fillable color in patterns (period 4), but test has many 8s—might over-apply solids.
 * Training successes suggest core segmentation and filling logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in mixed/2-heavy segments.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies major walls (e.g., edges all 8s, some internal full-8 columns implied), fills many segments with patterns (e.g., repeating 3s in row 1 between walls, 1-8-1 patterns around columns 9-12, 4-8-4 or solid 4s around 16-19, 9-8-9 later), and shows repetition across rows (e.g., rows 2-4, 6-8 similar with 2s in cols 3-4, 1s in 9-12, etc.), suggesting it's rendering a multi-row image like letters or icons.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Persistent 2s in specific positions (e.g., rows 3,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,19,21,22,24,25: columns 3-4 often 2,2; row 24 has 8,2 in col 3) indicate unfilled or skipped areas—these should likely be overwritten by patterns/solids if in valid segments, but weren't, possibly because 2s prevent dominance (>50% fails) or segments exclude them via side logic.
 * Repetitive structure (e.g., every other row has 8,8,8 in cols 3-5 vs. 2,2) looks like an attempt to draw shapes (perhaps "E" or bars with 3/1/4/9), but inconsistencies like row 24's partial 2 suggest incomplete processing—expected output should eliminate all 2s for a clean pattern.
 * Solid fills appear in places (e.g., row 1 all 8s outside, 3s in segments), but patterned areas have s=8 insertions that might disrupt if phase is wrong; test has many such, but if expected is smoother solids, this over-applies patterns.
 * Overall, output is better than raw input (assuming input had more 2s), but lingering 2s and row variations without vertical alignment mean it's not matching a coherent final image—needs better 2-handling or cross-row logic to fix.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 15:07:12] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where background (bg) is typically the border value (e.g., 8), and the goal is to identify vertical "walls" (full bg columns) that divide the grid into sections, then complete or correct patterns within those sections by filling inner areas based on side colors, majority non-bg elements, run lengths, and periodic patterns to match an expected visual design.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns that are entirely bg from top to bottom, including the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) edges; only add internal walls if fully bg.
 * Sections between walls must have matching non-bg side colors (sub[0] == sub[-1] != bg) and length >=3 to be processed; otherwise, skip.
 * Inner area (excluding sides) is filled with side color if it contains only bg or side color; otherwise, identify the most common non-bg, non-side color (c).
 * For patterns with c, compute run lengths of consecutive c's in the inner area, find the most frequent run length (k), assume period = k + 1 (alternating c and bg), and select the phase that minimizes changes to match this periodic unit.
 * Subtleties: If no runs of c, fall back to filling with side color; multiple candidates for max_freq take the largest k; the periodic fill overwrites the inner regardless of original content, which may over-simplify complex patterns.
 * Bg is assumed to be g[0][0], but grids may have uniform borders; ensure deep copy of grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Patterns may repeat vertically across rows but can vary slightly (e.g., offsets or interruptions), so processing is row-by-row but should consider vertical consistency implicitly through shared walls.
 * Easy to miss: Short sections (<3 inner length) are skipped; if inner has no non-bg non-side, it's a solid fill; the best_phase selection uses modulo for cycling the unit [c]*k + [bg].
 * Considerations: The approach assumes horizontal periodicity only within sections; vertical alignment across rows isn't enforced, leading to potential desync; numbers like 1,2,4,9 represent distinct "objects" or sub-patterns that may need preservation or completion rather than overwriting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import copy

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == bg for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This function correctly identifies wall columns and is essential for sectioning the grid.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Full program body as provided; it handles copying, wall finding, and per-row per-section processing.
    # Useful for overall structure, but the periodic filling logic needs refinement for complex test cases.
```
(The main program integrates wall finding with pattern completion; the run length and phase selection parts are key but may overfit simple cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully passed both training examples by correctly identifying walls, filling solid sections with side colors, and applying periodic patterns based on run analysis for repeating motifs.
 * Worked well for training: Handled simple repeating patterns (e.g., alternating colors between walls) by selecting optimal phases, resulting in clean, symmetric fills that matched expected outputs.
 * Did not work for test: The periodic overwrite ignores vertical consistency, leading to desynchronized patterns across rows (e.g., offsets in 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s); also, it treats all non-dominant colors uniformly, potentially erasing distinct sub-objects like isolated 1s or 2-pairs.
 * The fallback to side color fill works for empty inners but is applied too broadly when runs are absent or sparse.
 * Run length analysis assumes max frequent run defines period, which fits training but fails when test has irregular or multi-period patterns (e.g., combined motifs like 2-2 pairs interrupted by bg).
 * No vertical processing: Rows are independent, missing opportunities to propagate patterns downward for coherence.
 * Counter for non-bg non-side is helpful for selecting c, but most_common(1) ignores ties or low counts, which may pick wrong dominant in noisy test sections.
 * Deep copy via [row[:] for row in g] is correct and prevents input mutation.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all components (walls, runs, phase) are relevant but need tuning for subtlety like preserving short runs or multi-color sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies walls (implied by sectioned fills with 3s as sides in many rows) and applies periodic-like fills (e.g., repeating 3-8 or 3-bg patterns), but it does not look fully correct due to inconsistencies across rows.
 * Observed effects: Rows 0 and 28 are all 8s (bg borders, correct); many inner rows show attempted fills like [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] segments, suggesting solid or periodic 3-fills between walls at ~positions 0,7,14,21,28; however, sub-patterns like 1s (e.g., row 2: positions ~9-12: 1,8,1,8) and 2s (row 3: ~3-5: 2,2,8) are partially preserved but desynced (e.g., row 25 has [2,8,2,8] instead of consistent 8,2,2,8 from row 3).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have vertically aligned motifs (e.g., a consistent "ladder" of 1-8-1 across rows in one section, or symmetric 4s and 9s); instead, generated has row-specific variations (e.g., row 4 has 1,8,1,8,3 but row 5 shifts to 8,1,8,1,3; row 25 disrupts with 2,8,2,8 while others have 8,2,2,8), indicating the row-independent processing causes misalignment—likely the periodic phase isn't shared vertically.
 * 9s appear in later sections (e.g., row 4: ~24-26: 9,9,8) but inconsistently (some rows have 9,8,9 vs. 9,9,8), suggesting the run/period logic mismatches when sections have paired or clustered non-dominant colors.
 * Overall, test output is ~70% patterned but fails coherence: It overwrites too aggressively (e.g., row 14 has 4,8,4,4 which blends 4s oddly), erasing subtle interruptions; if expected is a complete, symmetric visual (e.g., shapes like letters or icons), this looks fragmented and incorrect for unknown reasons like phase selection per row instead of global.

[2025-10-03 15:07:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where rows represent patterns to be "resolved" or filled by adjusting blocks of a specific value S (non-background, non-border numbers like 1,3,8,9) based on the most common consecutive block length K of S in the inner row (excluding borders), while preserving border patterns of 2's and background B (like 4 or 8). The goal is to standardize S blocks to match K by splitting excess triples, filling gaps between S blocks proportionally or based on adjacent block sizes, and handling special end-of-row cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are fixed: Positions 0 and width-1 are always B; inner borders at 1 and width-2 are often 2's that should not be changed unless part of a specific rule, and rows with all-inner-2's or all-B are skipped.
 * S is dynamically chosen from unique inner values excluding B and 2; multiple S per row are processed sequentially, but only if K > 0 (i.e., S appears in blocks).
 * Core rule: Compute K as the mode (most common) length of consecutive S blocks in positions 2 to width-3; if no blocks, skip S.
 * Splitting: Any triple (or more) of S has the middle set to B to break into smaller blocks closer to K.
 * Gap filling: For double non-S gaps between S blocks, fill one side based on adjacent block sizes vs. K (prefer filling the side with smaller adjacent block; if equal, bias left or right); for triple non-S gaps flanked by S, fill the middle one.
 * End specials: Handle near-end doubles of S by setting the last to B; special case for non-S double followed by S double near end with trailing 2, by swapping/adjusting to S and B.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—split triples first, then fill gaps; avoid changing borders (1 < pos < width-1 only); K is only from inner blocks (start=2, end=width-3), ignoring potential edge blocks; rows with uniform inner 2's are skipped even if they have S elsewhere; multiple S types per row (e.g., 1 and 3 in same grid) are handled separately but may interact if positions overlap; all-B rows are unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Mode K ignores singletons or non-consecutive; gap filling considers full adjacent block sizes (chaining left/right from gap); special end rule only if width >=7 and exact pattern match; after filling, new blocks may not trigger re-computation of K (one-pass per row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Grids have repeating row patterns (e.g., every 5 rows: full B, 2-border, pattern, pattern, 2-border); test grid is wider (29 cols vs. 22), with mixed S (1,3,4,9) and 2's inside patterns; vertical alignment suggests column-wise consistency, but rules are row-only; 2's can appear mid-pattern (e.g., as separators or unfilled gaps) and should remain unless explicitly filled to S.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_mode_block_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, S: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the most common block length of consecutive S in row[start:end+1].
    Returns 0 if no blocks found. Useful for determining K per S type.
    """
    blocks = []
    j = start
    while j <= end:
        if row[j] == S:
            size = 0
            while j <= end and row[j] == S:
                size += 1
                j += 1
            blocks.append(size)
        else:
            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The above function is helpful and correctly extracts block modes, used in the main program for K. No other types or tools from attempts; the main program loop is a basic row processor but needs refinement for gap logic and end cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it correctly handled training example 1 (likely a simpler pattern with consistent filling).
 * Failed training example 2: For 8's in rows 12-14, generated split some triples (e.g., row 12 has 8,4,8,8,8 instead of expected 8,4,8,8,8—wait, actually mismatched by not filling enough to make consistent triples of 3, leaving isolated 8's and 4's where expected has merged 8,8,8 blocks separated by single 4's; specifically, positions like 4-6 should be 8,8,8 but generated 4,8,8,8; similar under-filling in later groups). For 9's in rows 17-19, no filling occurred at all (generated keeps 9,4,9 patterns unchanged, but expected also unchanged—wait, expected matches generated for 9's, so failure is isolated to 8's where mode K=3 was not fully applied to gaps). Overall, splitting worked partially, but gap filling logic (double/triple non-S) was incomplete or miscalculated adjacent sizes, leading to asymmetric or missed fills.
 * extract_objects not present or relevant (no object extraction; puzzle is block-based, not blob/object detection—don't use in future).
 * The special end double non-S double S rule fired incorrectly or not at all in some rows, as seen in partial matches.
 * Mode computation skipped edges correctly but may have missed chaining in gap size calc (e.g., left_size/right_size while loops are good but conditionals for change_pos are buggy, preferring wrong side when sizes equal or <K).
 * Train 2 mismatches in 8's for unknown reason in exact gap positions (e.g., expected row 13 has 8,8,8,4,8,8,8 but generated 8,8,8,4,8,4,8—inserted extra 4's or failed to fill).
 * Triple split rule over-applied or under-applied in dense areas, creating unintended small blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply partial splitting and minimal filling, leaving many irregular patterns unfilled (e.g., row 2 has 3,8,3,8 patterns but expected likely standardizes 3-blocks to a mode K, perhaps filling gaps to triples like in train 2's 8's; instead, it keeps scattered 3's with 8's as B). 
 * In rows with 1's (e.g., row 3: 3,8,1,8,8,3), no apparent filling of gaps around 1's, and 2's mid-row (e.g., 2,2 near pos 3-4) remain but may need S-fill if part of gap; expected probably merges 1's into consistent blocks separated by B.
 * 4's and 9's show uneven treatment: row 5 has 4,8,4,4 but scattered; 9's in later rows (e.g., row 5: 9,9) partially filled but not to mode (test has many 9,8,9,8 patterns unchanged, suggesting K=1 mode not triggering fills, but likely K=2 or more from context). 
 * Overall, output retains too much original irregularity (e.g., vertical columns don't align to consistent block patterns as in expected train 2), with 2's inside possibly unfilled gaps; it makes sense as a partial application but not correct, missing proportional gap fills and full standardization per S (e.g., 3's should likely be triples like train 2's 3's/8's). 
 * To handle test, need better multi-S interaction (e.g., 4's seem like another S, but program treats as possible S only if not B/2— in test B=8, so 4 is S but underfilled) and wider grid edge cases (width=29, more room for complex gaps).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based floor plan with walls (likely value 8), floors (likely value 3), and enclosed rooms containing tile patterns that are partially corrupted or inconsistent; the goal is to detect rooms and correct their internal patterns to a consistent repeating motif of a dominant color (C) in groups of size K followed by a single wall tile (W), using the minimal-difference phase-shifted periodic pattern that best fits the existing tiles.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are detected by finding columns with value W (8) in the floor row (row 1), assuming vertical symmetry and consistent wall positions across the grid height.
 * Rooms are segments between consecutive wall columns, excluding leading/trailing floor tiles (F=3) to focus on the "pattern segment"; borders (rows 0, h-2, h-1) and floor (row 1) are skipped to avoid modifying structural elements.
 * A room is only processed if its pattern segment uses exactly one non-W/non-F color (C); multiple colors cause skipping, which misses corrupted rooms needing unification.
 * Group sizes of consecutive C tiles in the segment are computed; the most frequent size K is used to define the period p = K + 1 (K C's + 1 W), and phase shifts (s from 0 to p-1) are tested to find the repeating pattern minimizing mismatches (diffs) with the current row.
 * Correction is applied only if it improves the row (min_diff > 0), but the code requires the expected first tile to match the actual first tile in the segment for a phase to be considered, which may overly restrict valid fits.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a room share the same pattern logic independently (no vertical alignment or multi-row consistency enforced), and patterns are horizontal-only per row.
 * Easy to miss: Floor row (row 1) has mixed F and W, used solely for wall detection; top/bottom borders are all W; rooms may have initial F padding; if no groups of C or multiple K frequencies, no correction happens.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns must repeat with exact period, but code allows only the most frequent K (or ties), potentially missing blended or evolving patterns; no handling for vertical propagation or room-wide color dominance beyond single-color check; assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Core logic for wall detection (helpful for identifying room boundaries consistently)
def detect_walls(grid: List[List[int]], floor_row: int = 1, w_val: int = 8) -> List[int]:
    w = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return sorted([j for j in range(w) if grid[floor_row][j] == w_val])
```

```python
# Pattern fitting logic (helpful for computing minimal-diff repeating pattern)
def fit_pattern(row_segment: List[int], c_val: int, k: int, w_val: int = 8) -> tuple[int, List[int]]:
    l = len(row_segment)
    p = k + 1
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    first_val = row_segment[0]
    for s in range(p):
        exp_first_pos = s % p
        exp_first = c_val if exp_first_pos < k else w_val
        if exp_first != first_val:
            continue
        this_diff = 0
        this_pattern = []
        for ii in range(l):
            pos = (ii + s) % p
            exp = c_val if pos < k else w_val
            if exp != row_segment[ii]:
                this_diff += 1
            this_pattern.append(exp)
        if this_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = this_diff
            best_pattern = this_pattern
    return min_diff, best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous program correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 by identifying single-color rooms, computing dominant K, and applying phase-shifted corrections where diffs > 0, resulting in uniform repeating patterns.
 * Worked well for rooms with exactly one C and clear group frequencies, enforcing periodicity without over-modifying borders or floors.
 * Did not work for test input: Skipped rooms with multiple colors (e.g., mixes of 1, 2, 4, 9 alongside potential C), leaving uncorrected inconsistencies like scattered 1s, 4s, and irregular 2/9 placements.
 * Phase restriction (matching first tile) may have blocked valid patterns in test rows with offset starts or leading non-C tiles.
 * No vertical consistency check, so horizontal fixes per row don't align rooms across heights, potentially missing global puzzle symmetry.
 * Counter for group sizes is helpful but only uses most frequent K; ties in frequency are handled by trying all, but blended rooms (multiple K) are ignored.
 * Wall detection from floor row is essential and correct, but assumes all walls align perfectly vertically, which holds in training but may not in more complex tests.
 * Single-color check (len(room_colors) != 1) is too strict for initialization/mixed states; training likely had pre-unified colors, but test has artifacts (1,2,4,9) needing merging to a dominant C.
 * No extraction of full objects/rooms as multi-row entities; per-row processing misses subtle vertical patterns or shared corrections.
 * The full program function is mostly helpful but broken for multi-color rooms (skips entirely) and not relevant for vertical or color-unification steps (don't reuse without fixes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to be the input grid with minimal or no changes, as rooms still contain multiple inconsistent colors (e.g., 1s and 4s in what should be unified patterns, 2s and 9s in irregular groups) instead of enforced repeating C-W motifs.
 * Specific differences: In rows like the third (index 2), output has [..., 3, 1, 8, 1, 8, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 3, ...] with scattered 1s and partial 4s, but expected would be uniform groups of a single C (e.g., all 4s in K=4 runs separated by 8s) across the room segment; similar issues in rows 4-28 with 9s misplaced (e.g., [..., 9, 9, 8, ...] vs. expected periodic 9-8 without breaks).
 * Patterns are not periodic: Group sizes vary (e.g., two 2s together, then singles), and no corrections applied, suggesting the single-color filter failed entirely for test rooms, leaving "corrupted" tiles intact.
 * Borders and floors remain unchanged (all 8s top/bottom, 3s with 8s in row 1), which is correct, but internal rooms show no improvement, unlike training where full uniformity was achieved.
 * Overall, output lacks the clean, repeating structure expected (e.g., no consistent K=3 or K=4 C blocks per room); it looks like raw input, indicating the program didn't engage correction logic for the test's complexity.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:

(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s

(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]

```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:

    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]

```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1

            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where background (bg) is typically the border value (e.g., 8), and the goal is to identify vertical "walls" (full bg columns) that divide the grid into sections, then complete or correct patterns within those sections by filling inner areas based on side colors, majority non-bg elements, run lengths, and periodic patterns to match an expected visual design.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns that are entirely bg from top to bottom, including the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) edges; only add internal walls if fully bg.
 * Sections between walls must have matching non-bg side colors (sub[0] == sub[-1] != bg) and length >=3 to be processed; otherwise, skip.
 * Inner area (excluding sides) is filled with side color if it contains only bg or side color; otherwise, identify the most common non-bg, non-side color (c).
 * For patterns with c, compute run lengths of consecutive c's in the inner area, find the most frequent run length (k), assume period = k + 1 (alternating c and bg), and select the phase that minimizes changes to match this periodic unit.
 * Subtleties: If no runs of c, fall back to filling with side color; multiple candidates for max_freq take the largest k; the periodic fill overwrites the inner regardless of original content, which may over-simplify complex patterns.
 * Bg is assumed to be g[0][0], but grids may have uniform borders; ensure deep copy of grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Patterns may repeat vertically across rows but can vary slightly (e.g., offsets or interruptions), so processing is row-by-row but should consider vertical consistency implicitly through shared walls.
 * Easy to miss: Short sections (<3 inner length) are skipped; if inner has no non-bg non-side, it's a solid fill; the best_phase selection uses modulo for cycling the unit [c]*k + [bg].
 * Considerations: The approach assumes horizontal periodicity only within sections; vertical alignment across rows isn't enforced, leading to potential desync; numbers like 1,2,4,9 represent distinct "objects" or sub-patterns that may need preservation or completion rather than overwriting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import copy

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == bg for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This function correctly identifies wall columns and is essential for sectioning the grid.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Full program body as provided; it handles copying, wall finding, and per-row per-section processing.
    # Useful for overall structure, but the periodic filling logic needs refinement for complex test cases.
```
(The main program integrates wall finding with pattern completion; the run length and phase selection parts are key but may overfit simple cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully passed both training examples by correctly identifying walls, filling solid sections with side colors, and applying periodic patterns based on run analysis for repeating motifs.
 * Worked well for training: Handled simple repeating patterns (e.g., alternating colors between walls) by selecting optimal phases, resulting in clean, symmetric fills that matched expected outputs.
 * Did not work for test: The periodic overwrite ignores vertical consistency, leading to desynchronized patterns across rows (e.g., offsets in 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s); also, it treats all non-dominant colors uniformly, potentially erasing distinct sub-objects like isolated 1s or 2-pairs.
 * The fallback to side color fill works for empty inners but is applied too broadly when runs are absent or sparse.
 * Run length analysis assumes max frequent run defines period, which fits training but fails when test has irregular or multi-period patterns (e.g., combined motifs like 2-2 pairs interrupted by bg).
 * No vertical processing: Rows are independent, missing opportunities to propagate patterns downward for coherence.
 * Counter for non-bg non-side is helpful for selecting c, but most_common(1) ignores ties or low counts, which may pick wrong dominant in noisy test sections.
 * Deep copy via [row[:] for row in g] is correct and prevents input mutation.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all components (walls, runs, phase) are relevant but need tuning for subtlety like preserving short runs or multi-color sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies walls (implied by sectioned fills with 3s as sides in many rows) and applies periodic-like fills (e.g., repeating 3-8 or 3-bg patterns), but it does not look fully correct due to inconsistencies across rows.
 * Observed effects: Rows 0 and 28 are all 8s (bg borders, correct); many inner rows show attempted fills like [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] segments, suggesting solid or periodic 3-fills between walls at ~positions 0,7,14,21,28; however, sub-patterns like 1s (e.g., row 2: positions ~9-12: 1,8,1,8) and 2s (row 3: ~3-5: 2,2,8) are partially preserved but desynced (e.g., row 25 has [2,8,2,8] instead of consistent 8,2,2,8 from row 3).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have vertically aligned motifs (e.g., a consistent "ladder" of 1-8-1 across rows in one section, or symmetric 4s and 9s); instead, generated has row-specific variations (e.g., row 4 has 1,8,1,8,3 but row 5 shifts to 8,1,8,1,3; row 25 disrupts with 2,8,2,8 while others have 8,2,2,8), indicating the row-independent processing causes misalignment—likely the periodic phase isn't shared vertically.
 * 9s appear in later sections (e.g., row 4: ~24-26: 9,9,8) but inconsistently (some rows have 9,8,9 vs. 9,9,8), suggesting the run/period logic mismatches when sections have paired or clustered non-dominant colors.
 * Overall, test output is ~70% patterned but fails coherence: It overwrites too aggressively (e.g., row 14 has 4,8,4,4 which blends 4s oddly), erasing subtle interruptions; if expected is a complete, symmetric visual (e.g., shapes like letters or icons), this looks fragmented and incorrect for unknown reasons like phase selection per row instead of global.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a 2D grid (likely representing a partially filled image or pattern with numeric "colors") by identifying vertical "wall" columns fully occupied by a background value (s, often 8), then filling the spaces between walls in each row with either solid dominant colors or periodic patterns based on predefined periods for specific colors (1,3,4,8,9), while ignoring or skipping certain values like 2 (possibly placeholders or errors) and ensuring majority dominance.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns where EVERY row has the background value s; partial walls (e.g., 8s in some but not all rows) do not qualify and should not be treated as boundaries.
 * Between walls, shrink the fillable region if the immediate side cells (istart and iend) match a non-s, non-2 color, treating them as fixed "frames" to avoid overwriting structural elements.
 * Dominant color detection ignores s and 2 values, requires >50% majority of non-ignored cells, and only considers valid colors {1,3,4,8,9}; if no dominant, skip filling that segment.
 * Patterns are periodic with fixed periods per color (e.g., 1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2), consisting of (p-1) instances of the color followed by one s (background for separation?); choose the phase that maximizes matches to the current row segment.
 * Compare periodic pattern matches to solid fills of the dominant color, applying whichever fits better (higher match count); this handles cases where the row is already mostly solid vs. patterned.
 * 2 values seem to act as "unknown" or "to-be-filled" placeholders that are skipped in analysis but should be overwritten during filling if they fall in the segment—persisting 2s indicate incomplete filling or mismatched segments.
 * Grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) are always treated as implicit walls.
 * Processing is row-by-row and segment-by-segment, modifying a copy of the grid; no vertical or global consistency enforcement across rows, which might miss multi-row patterns.
 * Subtle: Patterns cycle with phase shift, so alignment matters; solid fill can override if it matches more, but this might over-simplify irregular segments.
 * Potential miss: If a segment has mixed valid colors without >50% dominance, it skips, leaving 2s or originals intact—could lead to incomplete grids.
 * Periods are hardcoded and color-specific, implying the puzzle has predefined "textures" (e.g., 3 might be a dotted pattern with period 3).
 * No handling for horizontal walls or 2D connectivity; assumes independent row fills.
 * s is dynamically set from g[0][0], assuming uniform background.

# period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2} is a useful hardcoded mapping for color-to-period.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but get_solid_matches and the phase function assume exact matches including to s in patterns—might overcount if 2s are present, as they won't match c or s but aren't skipped in matching logic. No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-s, non-2); the code treats rows independently, which may not capture 2D shapes—future attempts might need blob extraction for vertical alignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating solid handling of wall detection, dominant color selection, and pattern/solid choice for simpler cases.
 * Worked well for cases with clear vertical walls and uniform row segments, as evidenced by correct training outputs.
 * What worked: Accurate wall finding (includes edges), dominant color with >50% threshold prevents false fills, phase selection maximizes fit, comparison to solid fill chooses better option, side-frame shrinking preserves boundaries.
 * What didn't work: In complex tests, 2s persist in output (e.g., positions like columns 3-4 in several rows), suggesting segments containing 2s either skipped (no dominant) or patterns didn't overwrite them effectively—unknown why, possibly because 2s dilute dominance or segments are too narrow/mixed.
 * Missed potential vertical consistency: Fills are per-row, but test output shows repeating row patterns (e.g., every 3 rows similar), hinting at multi-row objects that need cross-row propagation.
 * Side matching skips too aggressively if istart/iend are 2s (not handled, as side check is !=s and equal), potentially leaving narrow segments unfilled.
 * No handling for 8 as a fillable color in patterns (period 4), but test has many 8s—might over-apply solids.
 * Training successes suggest core segmentation and filling logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in mixed/2-heavy segments.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies major walls (e.g., edges all 8s, some internal full-8 columns implied), fills many segments with patterns (e.g., repeating 3s in row 1 between walls, 1-8-1 patterns around columns 9-12, 4-8-4 or solid 4s around 16-19, 9-8-9 later), and shows repetition across rows (e.g., rows 2-4, 6-8 similar with 2s in cols 3-4, 1s in 9-12, etc.), suggesting it's rendering a multi-row image like letters or icons.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Persistent 2s in specific positions (e.g., rows 3,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,19,21,22,24,25: columns 3-4 often 2,2; row 24 has 8,2 in col 3) indicate unfilled or skipped areas—these should likely be overwritten by patterns/solids if in valid segments, but weren't, possibly because 2s prevent dominance (>50% fails) or segments exclude them via side logic.
 * Repetitive structure (e.g., every other row has 8,8,8 in cols 3-5 vs. 2,2) looks like an attempt to draw shapes (perhaps "E" or bars with 3/1/4/9), but inconsistencies like row 24's partial 2 suggest incomplete processing—expected output should eliminate all 2s for a clean pattern.
 * Solid fills appear in places (e.g., row 1 all 8s outside, 3s in segments), but patterned areas have s=8 insertions that might disrupt if phase is wrong; test has many such, but if expected is smoother solids, this over-applies patterns.
 * Overall, output is better than raw input (assuming input had more 2s), but lingering 2s and row variations without vertical alignment mean it's not matching a coherent final image—needs better 2-handling or cross-row logic to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:09:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background value (likely 8) forms walls and empty spaces, and incomplete regions between walls in each row must be filled with periodic patterns derived from a detected dominant color 'c' in that region, using predefined periods and units that repeat the color interspersed with background. The goal is to complete the grid by applying the best-fitting phase of these patterns to match or preserve existing elements while filling gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns entirely filled with the background value 's' (e.g., 8), excluding the grid edges; they divide the grid into horizontal strips per row for independent processing.
 * Regions between walls are only processed if they contain exactly one non-background color 'c' (ignoring 's'), and 'c' != 2; otherwise, skip to avoid overwriting mixed or special cases.
 * If the colors immediately adjacent to the walls (sides) match and are non-background, treat them as preserved anchors and exclude them from the fillable interior (istart/iend adjusted inward).
 * Periodic patterns use a dictionary for periods: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}, with unit = [c] * (p-1) + [s]; this creates repeating motifs like [3,3,8] for c=3, p=3.
 * Best phase selection prioritizes maximum matches to the existing row, then maximum preservation of 'c' in positions expecting 'c', with ties broken by lowest phase index.
 * Apply patterns only to the interior (istart to iend); walls and sides remain untouched.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical consistency enforced across rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns copy; single-cell regions or left > right skipped; multiple colors or c=2 skip (2 may be a special "do not fill" or irregular pattern).
 * Subtlety: The program modifies a copy (new_g) to avoid in-place changes affecting checks; assumes rectangular grid.
 * Potential miss: If a region has no colors (all 's'), it skips, leaving empty; if side colors don't match, full region is considered without preservation.
 * Period dict includes 8 (background), but since c != s, it's unused; may be vestigial.

 * Worked well for simple periodic fills like c=3 with [3,3,8] repeats, as seen in row 2 and 28 of test output.
 * Did not work for mixed-color regions (e.g., containing 1,2,4,9), leaving them mostly unchanged, which may be correct if puzzle rules skip non-uniform areas but results in incomplete test output.
 * Skipped c=2 regions entirely, preserving 2s (e.g., rows 4,7,10 with [2,2] pairs), which seems intentional but may miss if 2 requires a different period (undefined in dict).
 * Wall detection worked, as output shows consistent 8s in wall positions and divisions.
 * Side preservation logic applied in some cases (e.g., symmetric 3s next to walls), but failed or skipped where sides mismatched, leading to full-region attempts that may overwrite incorrectly if colors >1.
 * Phase selection preserved some existing 1s/4s/9s (e.g., row 3 keeps 1s and 4s), but introduced mismatches like scattered 8s in pattern areas.
 * Overall, program understands core filling but may over-skip complex regions; no vertical propagation, which could be a miss if puzzle requires row consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_walls, get_colors, etc.) are relevant and functional, though period_dict lacks entry for 2 (intentional skip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: Top/bottom rows all 8s (background, correct); rows 2/28 show filled [3,3,3,3,3,3] patterns between 8 walls, matching p=3 unit [3,3,8] but with extra 3s (possibly phase 0 or overfill).
 * Middle rows retain input-like mixtures (e.g., row 3: 1s,4s,3s,8s scattered), suggesting skips for multi-color regions, but this leaves the grid incomplete/unchanged in key areas, unlike uniform training fills—expected more pattern imposition on 1/4/9 zones.
 * Patterns for c=3 appear in segments (e.g., row 3 has 3-8-3 repeats), but 2s (e.g., row 4: [2,2]) and 9s (row 5: [9,8,9]) are preserved without filling, which may be wrong if they need periods (2 undefined, 9 uses p=2: [9,8]).
 * Inconsistencies: Row 25 has [8,8,2,8,...] differing from similar rows (e.g., row 4 [8,2,2,8]), suggesting partial application or input variation, but overall lacks full periodicity (e.g., 1s not converted to [1,8] repeats).
 * Output does not look fully correct: Expected smoother, repeating patterns across all eligible regions (e.g., 1s to [1,8], 4s to [4,8], 9s to [9,8]), but instead mixes originals with partial 8/3 inserts; differs from training success by not transforming diverse colors uniformly—likely skips too aggressively on multi-color or c=2.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 15:09:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where rows represent patterns to be "resolved" or filled by adjusting blocks of a specific value S (non-background, non-border numbers like 1,3,8,9) based on the most common consecutive block length K of S in the inner row (excluding borders), while preserving border patterns of 2's and background B (like 4 or 8). The goal is to standardize S blocks to match K by splitting excess triples, filling gaps between S blocks proportionally or based on adjacent block sizes, and handling special end-of-row cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are fixed: Positions 0 and width-1 are always B; inner borders at 1 and width-2 are often 2's that should not be changed unless part of a specific rule, and rows with all-inner-2's or all-B are skipped.
 * S is dynamically chosen from unique inner values excluding B and 2; multiple S per row are processed sequentially, but only if K > 0 (i.e., S appears in blocks).
 * Core rule: Compute K as the mode (most common) length of consecutive S blocks in positions 2 to width-3; if no blocks, skip S.
 * Splitting: Any triple (or more) of S has the middle set to B to break into smaller blocks closer to K.
 * Gap filling: For double non-S gaps between S blocks, fill one side based on adjacent block sizes vs. K (prefer filling the side with smaller adjacent block; if equal, bias left or right); for triple non-S gaps flanked by S, fill the middle one.
 * End specials: Handle near-end doubles of S by setting the last to B; special case for non-S double followed by S double near end with trailing 2, by swapping/adjusting to S and B.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—split triples first, then fill gaps; avoid changing borders (1 < pos < width-1 only); K is only from inner blocks (start=2, end=width-3), ignoring potential edge blocks; rows with uniform inner 2's are skipped even if they have S elsewhere; multiple S types per row (e.g., 1 and 3 in same grid) are handled separately but may interact if positions overlap; all-B rows are unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Mode K ignores singletons or non-consecutive; gap filling considers full adjacent block sizes (chaining left/right from gap); special end rule only if width >=7 and exact pattern match; after filling, new blocks may not trigger re-computation of K (one-pass per row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Grids have repeating row patterns (e.g., every 5 rows: full B, 2-border, pattern, pattern, 2-border); test grid is wider (29 cols vs. 22), with mixed S (1,3,4,9) and 2's inside patterns; vertical alignment suggests column-wise consistency, but rules are row-only; 2's can appear mid-pattern (e.g., as separators or unfilled gaps) and should remain unless explicitly filled to S.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_mode_block_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, S: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the most common block length of consecutive S in row[start:end+1].
    Returns 0 if no blocks found. Useful for determining K per S type.
    """
    blocks = []
    j = start
    while j <= end:
        if row[j] == S:
            size = 0
            while j <= end and row[j] == S:
                size += 1
                j += 1
            blocks.append(size)
        else:
            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The above function is helpful and correctly extracts block modes, used in the main program for K. No other types or tools from attempts; the main program loop is a basic row processor but needs refinement for gap logic and end cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it correctly handled training example 1 (likely a simpler pattern with consistent filling).
 * Failed training example 2: For 8's in rows 12-14, generated split some triples (e.g., row 12 has 8,4,8,8,8 instead of expected 8,4,8,8,8—wait, actually mismatched by not filling enough to make consistent triples of 3, leaving isolated 8's and 4's where expected has merged 8,8,8 blocks separated by single 4's; specifically, positions like 4-6 should be 8,8,8 but generated 4,8,8,8; similar under-filling in later groups). For 9's in rows 17-19, no filling occurred at all (generated keeps 9,4,9 patterns unchanged, but expected also unchanged—wait, expected matches generated for 9's, so failure is isolated to 8's where mode K=3 was not fully applied to gaps). Overall, splitting worked partially, but gap filling logic (double/triple non-S) was incomplete or miscalculated adjacent sizes, leading to asymmetric or missed fills.
 * extract_objects not present or relevant (no object extraction; puzzle is block-based, not blob/object detection—don't use in future).
 * The special end double non-S double S rule fired incorrectly or not at all in some rows, as seen in partial matches.
 * Mode computation skipped edges correctly but may have missed chaining in gap size calc (e.g., left_size/right_size while loops are good but conditionals for change_pos are buggy, preferring wrong side when sizes equal or <K).
 * Train 2 mismatches in 8's for unknown reason in exact gap positions (e.g., expected row 13 has 8,8,8,4,8,8,8 but generated 8,8,8,4,8,4,8—inserted extra 4's or failed to fill).
 * Triple split rule over-applied or under-applied in dense areas, creating unintended small blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply partial splitting and minimal filling, leaving many irregular patterns unfilled (e.g., row 2 has 3,8,3,8 patterns but expected likely standardizes 3-blocks to a mode K, perhaps filling gaps to triples like in train 2's 8's; instead, it keeps scattered 3's with 8's as B). 
 * In rows with 1's (e.g., row 3: 3,8,1,8,8,3), no apparent filling of gaps around 1's, and 2's mid-row (e.g., 2,2 near pos 3-4) remain but may need S-fill if part of gap; expected probably merges 1's into consistent blocks separated by B.
 * 4's and 9's show uneven treatment: row 5 has 4,8,4,4 but scattered; 9's in later rows (e.g., row 5: 9,9) partially filled but not to mode (test has many 9,8,9,8 patterns unchanged, suggesting K=1 mode not triggering fills, but likely K=2 or more from context). 
 * Overall, output retains too much original irregularity (e.g., vertical columns don't align to consistent block patterns as in expected train 2), with 2's inside possibly unfilled gaps; it makes sense as a partial application but not correct, missing proportional gap fills and full standardization per S (e.g., 3's should likely be triples like train 2's 3's/8's). 
 * To handle test, need better multi-S interaction (e.g., 4's seem like another S, but program treats as possible S only if not B/2— in test B=8, so 4 is S but underfilled) and wider grid edge cases (width=29, more room for complex gaps).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based floor plan with walls (likely value 8), floors (likely value 3), and enclosed rooms containing tile patterns that are partially corrupted or inconsistent; the goal is to detect rooms and correct their internal patterns to a consistent repeating motif of a dominant color (C) in groups of size K followed by a single wall tile (W), using the minimal-difference phase-shifted periodic pattern that best fits the existing tiles.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are detected by finding columns with value W (8) in the floor row (row 1), assuming vertical symmetry and consistent wall positions across the grid height.
 * Rooms are segments between consecutive wall columns, excluding leading/trailing floor tiles (F=3) to focus on the "pattern segment"; borders (rows 0, h-2, h-1) and floor (row 1) are skipped to avoid modifying structural elements.
 * A room is only processed if its pattern segment uses exactly one non-W/non-F color (C); multiple colors cause skipping, which misses corrupted rooms needing unification.
 * Group sizes of consecutive C tiles in the segment are computed; the most frequent size K is used to define the period p = K + 1 (K C's + 1 W), and phase shifts (s from 0 to p-1) are tested to find the repeating pattern minimizing mismatches (diffs) with the current row.
 * Correction is applied only if it improves the row (min_diff > 0), but the code requires the expected first tile to match the actual first tile in the segment for a phase to be considered, which may overly restrict valid fits.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a room share the same pattern logic independently (no vertical alignment or multi-row consistency enforced), and patterns are horizontal-only per row.
 * Easy to miss: Floor row (row 1) has mixed F and W, used solely for wall detection; top/bottom borders are all W; rooms may have initial F padding; if no groups of C or multiple K frequencies, no correction happens.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns must repeat with exact period, but code allows only the most frequent K (or ties), potentially missing blended or evolving patterns; no handling for vertical propagation or room-wide color dominance beyond single-color check; assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

# Core logic for wall detection (helpful for identifying room boundaries consistently)
def detect_walls(grid: List[List[int]], floor_row: int = 1, w_val: int = 8) -> List[int]:
    w = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return sorted([j for j in range(w) if grid[floor_row][j] == w_val])
```

```python
# Pattern fitting logic (helpful for computing minimal-diff repeating pattern)
def fit_pattern(row_segment: List[int], c_val: int, k: int, w_val: int = 8) -> tuple[int, List[int]]:
    l = len(row_segment)
    p = k + 1
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    first_val = row_segment[0]
    for s in range(p):
        exp_first_pos = s % p
        exp_first = c_val if exp_first_pos < k else w_val
        if exp_first != first_val:
            continue
        this_diff = 0
        this_pattern = []
        for ii in range(l):
            pos = (ii + s) % p
            exp = c_val if pos < k else w_val
            if exp != row_segment[ii]:
                this_diff += 1
            this_pattern.append(exp)
        if this_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = this_diff
            best_pattern = this_pattern
    return min_diff, best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous program correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 by identifying single-color rooms, computing dominant K, and applying phase-shifted corrections where diffs > 0, resulting in uniform repeating patterns.
 * Worked well for rooms with exactly one C and clear group frequencies, enforcing periodicity without over-modifying borders or floors.
 * Did not work for test input: Skipped rooms with multiple colors (e.g., mixes of 1, 2, 4, 9 alongside potential C), leaving uncorrected inconsistencies like scattered 1s, 4s, and irregular 2/9 placements.
 * Phase restriction (matching first tile) may have blocked valid patterns in test rows with offset starts or leading non-C tiles.
 * No vertical consistency check, so horizontal fixes per row don't align rooms across heights, potentially missing global puzzle symmetry.
 * Counter for group sizes is helpful but only uses most frequent K; ties in frequency are handled by trying all, but blended rooms (multiple K) are ignored.
 * Wall detection from floor row is essential and correct, but assumes all walls align perfectly vertically, which holds in training but may not in more complex tests.
 * Single-color check (len(room_colors) != 1) is too strict for initialization/mixed states; training likely had pre-unified colors, but test has artifacts (1,2,4,9) needing merging to a dominant C.
 * No extraction of full objects/rooms as multi-row entities; per-row processing misses subtle vertical patterns or shared corrections.
 * The full program function is mostly helpful but broken for multi-color rooms (skips entirely) and not relevant for vertical or color-unification steps (don't reuse without fixes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to be the input grid with minimal or no changes, as rooms still contain multiple inconsistent colors (e.g., 1s and 4s in what should be unified patterns, 2s and 9s in irregular groups) instead of enforced repeating C-W motifs.
 * Specific differences: In rows like the third (index 2), output has [..., 3, 1, 8, 1, 8, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 3, ...] with scattered 1s and partial 4s, but expected would be uniform groups of a single C (e.g., all 4s in K=4 runs separated by 8s) across the room segment; similar issues in rows 4-28 with 9s misplaced (e.g., [..., 9, 9, 8, ...] vs. expected periodic 9-8 without breaks).
 * Patterns are not periodic: Group sizes vary (e.g., two 2s together, then singles), and no corrections applied, suggesting the single-color filter failed entirely for test rooms, leaving "corrupted" tiles intact.
 * Borders and floors remain unchanged (all 8s top/bottom, 3s with 8s in row 1), which is correct, but internal rooms show no improvement, unlike training where full uniformity was achieved.
 * Overall, output lacks the clean, repeating structure expected (e.g., no consistent K=3 or K=4 C blocks per room); it looks like raw input, indicating the program didn't engage correction logic for the test's complexity.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

            idx = (jj - istart + best_phase) % period
            new_g[r][jj] = pattern[idx]
    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; simple and reliable if grid is consistent.)

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Checks for bordered rows; essential for identifying candidates, but misses partial borders.)

```python
def get_inner_range(row: List[int], s: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    w = len(row)
    if w < 3:

    if row[1] == 2 and row[w - 2] == 2:
        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Core for identifying the pattern color c; strict majority threshold is a good subtlety to avoid noise, using collections.Counter.)

def get_period(c: int) -> int:
    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]

                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subinner: List[int], c: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(subinner)
    while i < n:
        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

```python
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    n = len(subinner)
    if n == 0:
        return None
    u = g_val + 1
    best_dist = float('inf')
    best_preserved = -1
    best_shift = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    for shift in range(u):
        pattern = [0] * n
        for ii in range(n):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where background (bg) is typically the border value (e.g., 8), and the goal is to identify vertical "walls" (full bg columns) that divide the grid into sections, then complete or correct patterns within those sections by filling inner areas based on side colors, majority non-bg elements, run lengths, and periodic patterns to match an expected visual design.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns that are entirely bg from top to bottom, including the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) edges; only add internal walls if fully bg.
 * Sections between walls must have matching non-bg side colors (sub[0] == sub[-1] != bg) and length >=3 to be processed; otherwise, skip.
 * Inner area (excluding sides) is filled with side color if it contains only bg or side color; otherwise, identify the most common non-bg, non-side color (c).
 * For patterns with c, compute run lengths of consecutive c's in the inner area, find the most frequent run length (k), assume period = k + 1 (alternating c and bg), and select the phase that minimizes changes to match this periodic unit.
 * Subtleties: If no runs of c, fall back to filling with side color; multiple candidates for max_freq take the largest k; the periodic fill overwrites the inner regardless of original content, which may over-simplify complex patterns.
 * Bg is assumed to be g[0][0], but grids may have uniform borders; ensure deep copy of grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Patterns may repeat vertically across rows but can vary slightly (e.g., offsets or interruptions), so processing is row-by-row but should consider vertical consistency implicitly through shared walls.
 * Easy to miss: Short sections (<3 inner length) are skipped; if inner has no non-bg non-side, it's a solid fill; the best_phase selection uses modulo for cycling the unit [c]*k + [bg].
 * Considerations: The approach assumes horizontal periodicity only within sections; vertical alignment across rows isn't enforced, leading to potential desync; numbers like 1,2,4,9 represent distinct "objects" or sub-patterns that may need preservation or completion rather than overwriting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import copy

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == bg for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This function correctly identifies wall columns and is essential for sectioning the grid.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Full program body as provided; it handles copying, wall finding, and per-row per-section processing.
    # Useful for overall structure, but the periodic filling logic needs refinement for complex test cases.
```
(The main program integrates wall finding with pattern completion; the run length and phase selection parts are key but may overfit simple cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully passed both training examples by correctly identifying walls, filling solid sections with side colors, and applying periodic patterns based on run analysis for repeating motifs.
 * Worked well for training: Handled simple repeating patterns (e.g., alternating colors between walls) by selecting optimal phases, resulting in clean, symmetric fills that matched expected outputs.
 * Did not work for test: The periodic overwrite ignores vertical consistency, leading to desynchronized patterns across rows (e.g., offsets in 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s); also, it treats all non-dominant colors uniformly, potentially erasing distinct sub-objects like isolated 1s or 2-pairs.
 * The fallback to side color fill works for empty inners but is applied too broadly when runs are absent or sparse.
 * Run length analysis assumes max frequent run defines period, which fits training but fails when test has irregular or multi-period patterns (e.g., combined motifs like 2-2 pairs interrupted by bg).
 * No vertical processing: Rows are independent, missing opportunities to propagate patterns downward for coherence.
 * Counter for non-bg non-side is helpful for selecting c, but most_common(1) ignores ties or low counts, which may pick wrong dominant in noisy test sections.
 * Deep copy via [row[:] for row in g] is correct and prevents input mutation.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all components (walls, runs, phase) are relevant but need tuning for subtlety like preserving short runs or multi-color sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies walls (implied by sectioned fills with 3s as sides in many rows) and applies periodic-like fills (e.g., repeating 3-8 or 3-bg patterns), but it does not look fully correct due to inconsistencies across rows.
 * Observed effects: Rows 0 and 28 are all 8s (bg borders, correct); many inner rows show attempted fills like [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] segments, suggesting solid or periodic 3-fills between walls at ~positions 0,7,14,21,28; however, sub-patterns like 1s (e.g., row 2: positions ~9-12: 1,8,1,8) and 2s (row 3: ~3-5: 2,2,8) are partially preserved but desynced (e.g., row 25 has [2,8,2,8] instead of consistent 8,2,2,8 from row 3).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have vertically aligned motifs (e.g., a consistent "ladder" of 1-8-1 across rows in one section, or symmetric 4s and 9s); instead, generated has row-specific variations (e.g., row 4 has 1,8,1,8,3 but row 5 shifts to 8,1,8,1,3; row 25 disrupts with 2,8,2,8 while others have 8,2,2,8), indicating the row-independent processing causes misalignment—likely the periodic phase isn't shared vertically.
 * 9s appear in later sections (e.g., row 4: ~24-26: 9,9,8) but inconsistently (some rows have 9,8,9 vs. 9,9,8), suggesting the run/period logic mismatches when sections have paired or clustered non-dominant colors.
 * Overall, test output is ~70% patterned but fails coherence: It overwrites too aggressively (e.g., row 14 has 4,8,4,4 which blends 4s oddly), erasing subtle interruptions; if expected is a complete, symmetric visual (e.g., shapes like letters or icons), this looks fragmented and incorrect for unknown reasons like phase selection per row instead of global.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background value (likely 8) forms walls and empty spaces, and incomplete regions between walls in each row must be filled with periodic patterns derived from a detected dominant color 'c' in that region, using predefined periods and units that repeat the color interspersed with background. The goal is to complete the grid by applying the best-fitting phase of these patterns to match or preserve existing elements while filling gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns entirely filled with the background value 's' (e.g., 8), excluding the grid edges; they divide the grid into horizontal strips per row for independent processing.
 * Regions between walls are only processed if they contain exactly one non-background color 'c' (ignoring 's'), and 'c' != 2; otherwise, skip to avoid overwriting mixed or special cases.
 * If the colors immediately adjacent to the walls (sides) match and are non-background, treat them as preserved anchors and exclude them from the fillable interior (istart/iend adjusted inward).
 * Periodic patterns use a dictionary for periods: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}, with unit = [c] * (p-1) + [s]; this creates repeating motifs like [3,3,8] for c=3, p=3.
 * Best phase selection prioritizes maximum matches to the existing row, then maximum preservation of 'c' in positions expecting 'c', with ties broken by lowest phase index.
 * Apply patterns only to the interior (istart to iend); walls and sides remain untouched.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical consistency enforced across rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns copy; single-cell regions or left > right skipped; multiple colors or c=2 skip (2 may be a special "do not fill" or irregular pattern).
 * Subtlety: The program modifies a copy (new_g) to avoid in-place changes affecting checks; assumes rectangular grid.
 * Potential miss: If a region has no colors (all 's'), it skips, leaving empty; if side colors don't match, full region is considered without preservation.
 * Period dict includes 8 (background), but since c != s, it's unused; may be vestigial.

        new_row[jj] = unit[idx]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, applying patterns to single-color regions and preserving sides where applicable.
 * Worked well for simple periodic fills like c=3 with [3,3,8] repeats, as seen in row 2 and 28 of test output.
 * Did not work for mixed-color regions (e.g., containing 1,2,4,9), leaving them mostly unchanged, which may be correct if puzzle rules skip non-uniform areas but results in incomplete test output.
 * Skipped c=2 regions entirely, preserving 2s (e.g., rows 4,7,10 with [2,2] pairs), which seems intentional but may miss if 2 requires a different period (undefined in dict).
 * Wall detection worked, as output shows consistent 8s in wall positions and divisions.
 * Side preservation logic applied in some cases (e.g., symmetric 3s next to walls), but failed or skipped where sides mismatched, leading to full-region attempts that may overwrite incorrectly if colors >1.
 * Phase selection preserved some existing 1s/4s/9s (e.g., row 3 keeps 1s and 4s), but introduced mismatches like scattered 8s in pattern areas.
 * Overall, program understands core filling but may over-skip complex regions; no vertical propagation, which could be a miss if puzzle requires row consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_walls, get_colors, etc.) are relevant and functional, though period_dict lacks entry for 2 (intentional skip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: Top/bottom rows all 8s (background, correct); rows 2/28 show filled [3,3,3,3,3,3] patterns between 8 walls, matching p=3 unit [3,3,8] but with extra 3s (possibly phase 0 or overfill).
 * Middle rows retain input-like mixtures (e.g., row 3: 1s,4s,3s,8s scattered), suggesting skips for multi-color regions, but this leaves the grid incomplete/unchanged in key areas, unlike uniform training fills—expected more pattern imposition on 1/4/9 zones.
 * Patterns for c=3 appear in segments (e.g., row 3 has 3-8-3 repeats), but 2s (e.g., row 4: [2,2]) and 9s (row 5: [9,8,9]) are preserved without filling, which may be wrong if they need periods (2 undefined, 9 uses p=2: [9,8]).
 * Inconsistencies: Row 25 has [8,8,2,8,...] differing from similar rows (e.g., row 4 [8,2,2,8]), suggesting partial application or input variation, but overall lacks full periodicity (e.g., 1s not converted to [1,8] repeats).
 * Output does not look fully correct: Expected smoother, repeating patterns across all eligible regions (e.g., 1s to [1,8], 4s to [4,8], 9s to [9,8]), but instead mixes originals with partial 8/3 inserts; differs from training success by not transforming diverse colors uniformly—likely skips too aggressively on multi-color or c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a 2D grid (likely representing a partially filled image or pattern with numeric "colors") by identifying vertical "wall" columns fully occupied by a background value (s, often 8), then filling the spaces between walls in each row with either solid dominant colors or periodic patterns based on predefined periods for specific colors (1,3,4,8,9), while ignoring or skipping certain values like 2 (possibly placeholders or errors) and ensuring majority dominance.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns where EVERY row has the background value s; partial walls (e.g., 8s in some but not all rows) do not qualify and should not be treated as boundaries.
 * Between walls, shrink the fillable region if the immediate side cells (istart and iend) match a non-s, non-2 color, treating them as fixed "frames" to avoid overwriting structural elements.
 * Dominant color detection ignores s and 2 values, requires >50% majority of non-ignored cells, and only considers valid colors {1,3,4,8,9}; if no dominant, skip filling that segment.
 * Patterns are periodic with fixed periods per color (e.g., 1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2), consisting of (p-1) instances of the color followed by one s (background for separation?); choose the phase that maximizes matches to the current row segment.
 * Compare periodic pattern matches to solid fills of the dominant color, applying whichever fits better (higher match count); this handles cases where the row is already mostly solid vs. patterned.
 * 2 values seem to act as "unknown" or "to-be-filled" placeholders that are skipped in analysis but should be overwritten during filling if they fall in the segment—persisting 2s indicate incomplete filling or mismatched segments.
 * Grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) are always treated as implicit walls.
 * Processing is row-by-row and segment-by-segment, modifying a copy of the grid; no vertical or global consistency enforcement across rows, which might miss multi-row patterns.
 * Subtle: Patterns cycle with phase shift, so alignment matters; solid fill can override if it matches more, but this might over-simplify irregular segments.
 * Potential miss: If a segment has mixed valid colors without >50% dominance, it skips, leaving 2s or originals intact—could lead to incomplete grids.
 * Periods are hardcoded and color-specific, implying the puzzle has predefined "textures" (e.g., 3 might be a dotted pattern with period 3).
 * No handling for horizontal walls or 2D connectivity; assumes independent row fills.
 * s is dynamically set from g[0][0], assuming uniform background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies vertical wall columns (all rows == s), adds edges; useful for segmenting the grid horizontally.
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```

```python
def get_dominant_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    # Extracts non-s, non-2 values in a row segment, finds majority color if >50% and in valid set {1,3,4,8,9}.
    # Key for deciding what to fill; ignores 2s correctly but skips if no strong dominant.
    vals = [g[r][j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] != s and g[r][j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    cnt = Counter(vals)
    most_c, count = cnt.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5 and most_c in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most_c
    return -1
```

```python
def get_periodic_pattern(c: int, p: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    # Generates a repeating pattern for a color with period p (e.g., [c, s] for p=2); essential for textured fills.
    return [c] * (p - 1) + [s]
```

```python
def get_best_phase(g: List[List[int]], r: int, istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], p: int) -> int:
    # Tries all phases of the pattern to find the best fit (max matches) in the segment; returns phase and match count.
    # Note: The provided code returns a tuple, but usage expects two values—fixed in implementation.
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(p):
        matches = sum(1 for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] == pattern[(j - istart + phase) % p])
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase, best_matches
```

```python
# Solid and pattern application functions (apply_solid, apply_pattern) are helpful for modifying segments directly.
# period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2} is a useful hardcoded mapping for color-to-period.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but get_solid_matches and the phase function assume exact matches including to s in patterns—might overcount if 2s are present, as they won't match c or s but aren't skipped in matching logic. No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-s, non-2); the code treats rows independently, which may not capture 2D shapes—future attempts might need blob extraction for vertical alignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating solid handling of wall detection, dominant color selection, and pattern/solid choice for simpler cases.
 * Worked well for cases with clear vertical walls and uniform row segments, as evidenced by correct training outputs.
 * What worked: Accurate wall finding (includes edges), dominant color with >50% threshold prevents false fills, phase selection maximizes fit, comparison to solid fill chooses better option, side-frame shrinking preserves boundaries.
 * What didn't work: In complex tests, 2s persist in output (e.g., positions like columns 3-4 in several rows), suggesting segments containing 2s either skipped (no dominant) or patterns didn't overwrite them effectively—unknown why, possibly because 2s dilute dominance or segments are too narrow/mixed.
 * Missed potential vertical consistency: Fills are per-row, but test output shows repeating row patterns (e.g., every 3 rows similar), hinting at multi-row objects that need cross-row propagation.
 * Side matching skips too aggressively if istart/iend are 2s (not handled, as side check is !=s and equal), potentially leaving narrow segments unfilled.
 * No handling for 8 as a fillable color in patterns (period 4), but test has many 8s—might over-apply solids.
 * Training successes suggest core segmentation and filling logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in mixed/2-heavy segments.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies major walls (e.g., edges all 8s, some internal full-8 columns implied), fills many segments with patterns (e.g., repeating 3s in row 1 between walls, 1-8-1 patterns around columns 9-12, 4-8-4 or solid 4s around 16-19, 9-8-9 later), and shows repetition across rows (e.g., rows 2-4, 6-8 similar with 2s in cols 3-4, 1s in 9-12, etc.), suggesting it's rendering a multi-row image like letters or icons.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Persistent 2s in specific positions (e.g., rows 3,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,19,21,22,24,25: columns 3-4 often 2,2; row 24 has 8,2 in col 3) indicate unfilled or skipped areas—these should likely be overwritten by patterns/solids if in valid segments, but weren't, possibly because 2s prevent dominance (>50% fails) or segments exclude them via side logic.
 * Repetitive structure (e.g., every other row has 8,8,8 in cols 3-5 vs. 2,2) looks like an attempt to draw shapes (perhaps "E" or bars with 3/1/4/9), but inconsistencies like row 24's partial 2 suggest incomplete processing—expected output should eliminate all 2s for a clean pattern.
 * Solid fills appear in places (e.g., row 1 all 8s outside, 3s in segments), but patterned areas have s=8 insertions that might disrupt if phase is wrong; test has many such, but if expected is smoother solids, this over-applies patterns.
 * Overall, output is better than raw input (assuming input had more 2s), but lingering 2s and row variations without vertical alignment mean it's not matching a coherent final image—needs better 2-handling or cross-row logic to fix.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 15:11:49] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], B: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]

        if all(g[i][j] == B for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))

def get_mode_k(blocks: List[int]) -> int:
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    max_f = max(count.values())
    cand_ks = [k for k, f in count.items() if f == max_f]
    return max(cand_ks)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:12:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background color B (likely 8 in the test) forms vertical walls (full-height columns), dividing the grid into horizontal sections that need to be cleaned or filled based on detected patterns of a single foreground color S (from a limited set like 1-4,9). The goal is to identify repeating block patterns of S separated by B or solid fills of S in the inner parts of sections, choosing the best fit to minimize errors and maximize matches against the noisy input.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with B; they include the grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) and any internal full-B columns, and they remain unchanged.
 * Sections between walls (subrows) may have optional side decorations (matching colors at the start/end, not B), so the "inner" is the subrow excluding those sides if they exist and match.
 * For filling to apply, the inner must contain exactly one unique non-B, non-side color (S), and S must be in {1,2,3,4,8,9} (but 8 is B, so effectively 1-4,9); multiple candidates or invalid S skips the section.
 * Patterns are horizontal: compute consecutive block lengths of S in the inner (ignoring non-S), find the mode (most frequent) block size K (max if ties), then test phases (0 to K) for a repeating cycle of K S's followed by 1 B, scoring by mismatches (non-2 cells not matching expected S/B) and presences (existing S where expected).
 * Compare pattern score to solid S fill score (mismatches: non-S non-2 cells; presences: existing S cells); prefer solid if equal mismatches but more presences, or strictly fewer mismatches; 2 seems to be a wildcard/unknown that doesn't count as mismatch.
 * Filling modifies the inner in-place and copies back to the row, but only if conditions met; empty inners or no blocks skip.
 * Process each row independently, but walls are global (same for all rows); unchanged cells (noise like stray 1,2,4,9) persist if no pattern detected.
 * Subtle: Block counting skips non-S cells without counting them as separators (only consecutive S runs); mode K=0 skips. Phases wrap modulo (K+1). Side colors block inner if present and non-B.
 * Edge cases: Zero-length subrows/inners skip; ties in mode take max K; best phase prefers lower ph on tie. B is assumed g[0][0], but should verify consistency.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal changes: only fill sections with strong single-S evidence, preferring patterns that align with existing data over solid fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations detailed, but it builds on pattern recognition logic that succeeded on training.
 * What worked: Correctly identified and filled simple horizontal sections with single S and clear block modes in training examples 1 and 2 (full correctness), demonstrating solid wall detection, candidate S filtering, mode computation, phase/solid comparison, and in-place filling/rebasing.
 * What didn't work: In the test, filling is incomplete—many sections remain noisy (e.g., scattered 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s persist), suggesting skips due to multiple candidates in inners, invalid S, or no blocks/mode=0; horizontal-only processing may miss vertical or diagonal patterns if the puzzle has them (unknown, but output irregularity hints at this). Side color detection works but may over-exclude inners in complex sections. No global consistency check across rows (e.g., same S/pattern per section vertically), leading to row-by-row inconsistencies like filled 3-strips in rows 1/27 but noisy middles. Block counting ignores non-S as separators, which may fail if noise creates false short blocks. S set includes 8 (B), but logic skips it anyway—redundant but harmless.
 * The main program loop correctly sections per row using global walls and handles side/inner extraction, but skips too conservatively (e.g., if any inner has extra colors like 1+4, whole section untouched).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though compute_best_phase assumes horizontal linearity—may need vertical extension if patterns align column-wise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves wall columns (likely positions with all 8s) as 8s, fills some horizontal strips with clean groups of 3s (e.g., row 1: repeating 6x3 +8; row 27 similar), and preserves edges/full-8 rows (0 and 28), indicating successful detection of S=3 in simple sections with mode K~6.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: middle rows (e.g., 2-26) retain heavy noise like isolated 1s, pairs of 2s, blocks of 4s, and 9s (e.g., row 2: 8,3,8,1,8,1,8,1,...; row 4: ...9,9,8,...), which weren't filled, suggesting the program skipped due to multiple candidates (1,2,4,9 all present in some inners) or low block evidence; this leaves the grid patchy/inconsistent vertically (e.g., column ~3 has 3 in row1 but 1/2 in row2-3). Expected output should likely clean more sections to uniform S/B patterns (perhaps S=3 dominant, with vertical alignment), minimizing all noise—current output has ~20-30% unclean cells per noisy row, far from a "solved" puzzle. Unknown if input had vertical patterns requiring cross-row logic, but output's row-variation implies the horizontal-only approach misses this, producing suboptimal fills.

[2025-10-03 15:12:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where rows represent patterns to be "resolved" or filled by adjusting blocks of a specific value S (non-background, non-border numbers like 1,3,8,9) based on the most common consecutive block length K of S in the inner row (excluding borders), while preserving border patterns of 2's and background B (like 4 or 8). The goal is to standardize S blocks to match K by splitting excess triples, filling gaps between S blocks proportionally or based on adjacent block sizes, and handling special end-of-row cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are fixed: Positions 0 and width-1 are always B; inner borders at 1 and width-2 are often 2's that should not be changed unless part of a specific rule, and rows with all-inner-2's or all-B are skipped.
 * S is dynamically chosen from unique inner values excluding B and 2; multiple S per row are processed sequentially, but only if K > 0 (i.e., S appears in blocks).
 * Core rule: Compute K as the mode (most common) length of consecutive S blocks in positions 2 to width-3; if no blocks, skip S.
 * Splitting: Any triple (or more) of S has the middle set to B to break into smaller blocks closer to K.
 * Gap filling: For double non-S gaps between S blocks, fill one side based on adjacent block sizes vs. K (prefer filling the side with smaller adjacent block; if equal, bias left or right); for triple non-S gaps flanked by S, fill the middle one.
 * End specials: Handle near-end doubles of S by setting the last to B; special case for non-S double followed by S double near end with trailing 2, by swapping/adjusting to S and B.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—split triples first, then fill gaps; avoid changing borders (1 < pos < width-1 only); K is only from inner blocks (start=2, end=width-3), ignoring potential edge blocks; rows with uniform inner 2's are skipped even if they have S elsewhere; multiple S types per row (e.g., 1 and 3 in same grid) are handled separately but may interact if positions overlap; all-B rows are unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Mode K ignores singletons or non-consecutive; gap filling considers full adjacent block sizes (chaining left/right from gap); special end rule only if width >=7 and exact pattern match; after filling, new blocks may not trigger re-computation of K (one-pass per row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Grids have repeating row patterns (e.g., every 5 rows: full B, 2-border, pattern, pattern, 2-border); test grid is wider (29 cols vs. 22), with mixed S (1,3,4,9) and 2's inside patterns; vertical alignment suggests column-wise consistency, but rules are row-only; 2's can appear mid-pattern (e.g., as separators or unfilled gaps) and should remain unless explicitly filled to S.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_mode_block_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, S: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the most common block length of consecutive S in row[start:end+1].
    Returns 0 if no blocks found. Useful for determining K per S type.
    """
    blocks = []
    j = start
    while j <= end:
        if row[j] == S:
            size = 0
            while j <= end and row[j] == S:
                size += 1
                j += 1
            blocks.append(size)
        else:
            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The above function is helpful and correctly extracts block modes, used in the main program for K. No other types or tools from attempts; the main program loop is a basic row processor but needs refinement for gap logic and end cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it correctly handled training example 1 (likely a simpler pattern with consistent filling).
 * Failed training example 2: For 8's in rows 12-14, generated split some triples (e.g., row 12 has 8,4,8,8,8 instead of expected 8,4,8,8,8—wait, actually mismatched by not filling enough to make consistent triples of 3, leaving isolated 8's and 4's where expected has merged 8,8,8 blocks separated by single 4's; specifically, positions like 4-6 should be 8,8,8 but generated 4,8,8,8; similar under-filling in later groups). For 9's in rows 17-19, no filling occurred at all (generated keeps 9,4,9 patterns unchanged, but expected also unchanged—wait, expected matches generated for 9's, so failure is isolated to 8's where mode K=3 was not fully applied to gaps). Overall, splitting worked partially, but gap filling logic (double/triple non-S) was incomplete or miscalculated adjacent sizes, leading to asymmetric or missed fills.
 * extract_objects not present or relevant (no object extraction; puzzle is block-based, not blob/object detection—don't use in future).
 * The special end double non-S double S rule fired incorrectly or not at all in some rows, as seen in partial matches.
 * Mode computation skipped edges correctly but may have missed chaining in gap size calc (e.g., left_size/right_size while loops are good but conditionals for change_pos are buggy, preferring wrong side when sizes equal or <K).
 * Train 2 mismatches in 8's for unknown reason in exact gap positions (e.g., expected row 13 has 8,8,8,4,8,8,8 but generated 8,8,8,4,8,4,8—inserted extra 4's or failed to fill).
 * Triple split rule over-applied or under-applied in dense areas, creating unintended small blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply partial splitting and minimal filling, leaving many irregular patterns unfilled (e.g., row 2 has 3,8,3,8 patterns but expected likely standardizes 3-blocks to a mode K, perhaps filling gaps to triples like in train 2's 8's; instead, it keeps scattered 3's with 8's as B). 
 * In rows with 1's (e.g., row 3: 3,8,1,8,8,3), no apparent filling of gaps around 1's, and 2's mid-row (e.g., 2,2 near pos 3-4) remain but may need S-fill if part of gap; expected probably merges 1's into consistent blocks separated by B.
 * 4's and 9's show uneven treatment: row 5 has 4,8,4,4 but scattered; 9's in later rows (e.g., row 5: 9,9) partially filled but not to mode (test has many 9,8,9,8 patterns unchanged, suggesting K=1 mode not triggering fills, but likely K=2 or more from context). 
 * Overall, output retains too much original irregularity (e.g., vertical columns don't align to consistent block patterns as in expected train 2), with 2's inside possibly unfilled gaps; it makes sense as a partial application but not correct, missing proportional gap fills and full standardization per S (e.g., 3's should likely be triples like train 2's 3's/8's). 
 * To handle test, need better multi-S interaction (e.g., 4's seem like another S, but program treats as possible S only if not B/2— in test B=8, so 4 is S but underfilled) and wider grid edge cases (width=29, more room for complex gaps).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based floor plan with walls (likely value 8), floors (likely value 3), and enclosed rooms containing tile patterns that are partially corrupted or inconsistent; the goal is to detect rooms and correct their internal patterns to a consistent repeating motif of a dominant color (C) in groups of size K followed by a single wall tile (W), using the minimal-difference phase-shifted periodic pattern that best fits the existing tiles.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are detected by finding columns with value W (8) in the floor row (row 1), assuming vertical symmetry and consistent wall positions across the grid height.
 * Rooms are segments between consecutive wall columns, excluding leading/trailing floor tiles (F=3) to focus on the "pattern segment"; borders (rows 0, h-2, h-1) and floor (row 1) are skipped to avoid modifying structural elements.
 * A room is only processed if its pattern segment uses exactly one non-W/non-F color (C); multiple colors cause skipping, which misses corrupted rooms needing unification.
 * Group sizes of consecutive C tiles in the segment are computed; the most frequent size K is used to define the period p = K + 1 (K C's + 1 W), and phase shifts (s from 0 to p-1) are tested to find the repeating pattern minimizing mismatches (diffs) with the current row.
 * Correction is applied only if it improves the row (min_diff > 0), but the code requires the expected first tile to match the actual first tile in the segment for a phase to be considered, which may overly restrict valid fits.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a room share the same pattern logic independently (no vertical alignment or multi-row consistency enforced), and patterns are horizontal-only per row.
 * Easy to miss: Floor row (row 1) has mixed F and W, used solely for wall detection; top/bottom borders are all W; rooms may have initial F padding; if no groups of C or multiple K frequencies, no correction happens.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns must repeat with exact period, but code allows only the most frequent K (or ties), potentially missing blended or evolving patterns; no handling for vertical propagation or room-wide color dominance beyond single-color check; assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

# Core logic for wall detection (helpful for identifying room boundaries consistently)
def detect_walls(grid: List[List[int]], floor_row: int = 1, w_val: int = 8) -> List[int]:
    w = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return sorted([j for j in range(w) if grid[floor_row][j] == w_val])
```

```python
# Pattern fitting logic (helpful for computing minimal-diff repeating pattern)
def fit_pattern(row_segment: List[int], c_val: int, k: int, w_val: int = 8) -> tuple[int, List[int]]:
    l = len(row_segment)
    p = k + 1
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    first_val = row_segment[0]
    for s in range(p):
        exp_first_pos = s % p
        exp_first = c_val if exp_first_pos < k else w_val
        if exp_first != first_val:
            continue
        this_diff = 0
        this_pattern = []
        for ii in range(l):
            pos = (ii + s) % p
            exp = c_val if pos < k else w_val
            if exp != row_segment[ii]:
                this_diff += 1
            this_pattern.append(exp)
        if this_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = this_diff
            best_pattern = this_pattern
    return min_diff, best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous program correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 by identifying single-color rooms, computing dominant K, and applying phase-shifted corrections where diffs > 0, resulting in uniform repeating patterns.
 * Worked well for rooms with exactly one C and clear group frequencies, enforcing periodicity without over-modifying borders or floors.
 * Did not work for test input: Skipped rooms with multiple colors (e.g., mixes of 1, 2, 4, 9 alongside potential C), leaving uncorrected inconsistencies like scattered 1s, 4s, and irregular 2/9 placements.
 * Phase restriction (matching first tile) may have blocked valid patterns in test rows with offset starts or leading non-C tiles.
 * No vertical consistency check, so horizontal fixes per row don't align rooms across heights, potentially missing global puzzle symmetry.
 * Counter for group sizes is helpful but only uses most frequent K; ties in frequency are handled by trying all, but blended rooms (multiple K) are ignored.
 * Wall detection from floor row is essential and correct, but assumes all walls align perfectly vertically, which holds in training but may not in more complex tests.
 * Single-color check (len(room_colors) != 1) is too strict for initialization/mixed states; training likely had pre-unified colors, but test has artifacts (1,2,4,9) needing merging to a dominant C.
 * No extraction of full objects/rooms as multi-row entities; per-row processing misses subtle vertical patterns or shared corrections.
 * The full program function is mostly helpful but broken for multi-color rooms (skips entirely) and not relevant for vertical or color-unification steps (don't reuse without fixes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to be the input grid with minimal or no changes, as rooms still contain multiple inconsistent colors (e.g., 1s and 4s in what should be unified patterns, 2s and 9s in irregular groups) instead of enforced repeating C-W motifs.
 * Specific differences: In rows like the third (index 2), output has [..., 3, 1, 8, 1, 8, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 3, ...] with scattered 1s and partial 4s, but expected would be uniform groups of a single C (e.g., all 4s in K=4 runs separated by 8s) across the room segment; similar issues in rows 4-28 with 9s misplaced (e.g., [..., 9, 9, 8, ...] vs. expected periodic 9-8 without breaks).
 * Patterns are not periodic: Group sizes vary (e.g., two 2s together, then singles), and no corrections applied, suggesting the single-color filter failed entirely for test rooms, leaving "corrupted" tiles intact.
 * Borders and floors remain unchanged (all 8s top/bottom, 3s with 8s in row 1), which is correct, but internal rooms show no improvement, unlike training where full uniformity was achieved.
 * Overall, output lacks the clean, repeating structure expected (e.g., no consistent K=3 or K=4 C blocks per room); it looks like raw input, indicating the program didn't engage correction logic for the test's complexity.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

            new_g[r][jj] = pattern[idx]
    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; simple and reliable if grid is consistent.)

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Checks for bordered rows; essential for identifying candidates, but misses partial borders.)

```python
def get_inner_range(row: List[int], s: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    w = len(row)
    if w < 3:
        return 1, 0
    if row[1] == 2 and row[w - 2] == 2:
        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Core for identifying the pattern color c; strict majority threshold is a good subtlety to avoid noise, using collections.Counter.)

```python
def get_period(c: int) -> int:
    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subinner: List[int], c: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(subinner)
    while i < n:
        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

```python
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    n = len(subinner)
    if n == 0:
        return None
    u = g_val + 1
    best_dist = float('inf')
    best_preserved = -1
    best_shift = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    for shift in range(u):
        pattern = [0] * n
        for ii in range(n):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where background (bg) is typically the border value (e.g., 8), and the goal is to identify vertical "walls" (full bg columns) that divide the grid into sections, then complete or correct patterns within those sections by filling inner areas based on side colors, majority non-bg elements, run lengths, and periodic patterns to match an expected visual design.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns that are entirely bg from top to bottom, including the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) edges; only add internal walls if fully bg.
 * Sections between walls must have matching non-bg side colors (sub[0] == sub[-1] != bg) and length >=3 to be processed; otherwise, skip.
 * Inner area (excluding sides) is filled with side color if it contains only bg or side color; otherwise, identify the most common non-bg, non-side color (c).
 * For patterns with c, compute run lengths of consecutive c's in the inner area, find the most frequent run length (k), assume period = k + 1 (alternating c and bg), and select the phase that minimizes changes to match this periodic unit.
 * Subtleties: If no runs of c, fall back to filling with side color; multiple candidates for max_freq take the largest k; the periodic fill overwrites the inner regardless of original content, which may over-simplify complex patterns.
 * Bg is assumed to be g[0][0], but grids may have uniform borders; ensure deep copy of grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Patterns may repeat vertically across rows but can vary slightly (e.g., offsets or interruptions), so processing is row-by-row but should consider vertical consistency implicitly through shared walls.
 * Easy to miss: Short sections (<3 inner length) are skipped; if inner has no non-bg non-side, it's a solid fill; the best_phase selection uses modulo for cycling the unit [c]*k + [bg].
 * Considerations: The approach assumes horizontal periodicity only within sections; vertical alignment across rows isn't enforced, leading to potential desync; numbers like 1,2,4,9 represent distinct "objects" or sub-patterns that may need preservation or completion rather than overwriting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import copy

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == bg for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This function correctly identifies wall columns and is essential for sectioning the grid.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Full program body as provided; it handles copying, wall finding, and per-row per-section processing.
    # Useful for overall structure, but the periodic filling logic needs refinement for complex test cases.
```
(The main program integrates wall finding with pattern completion; the run length and phase selection parts are key but may overfit simple cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully passed both training examples by correctly identifying walls, filling solid sections with side colors, and applying periodic patterns based on run analysis for repeating motifs.
 * Worked well for training: Handled simple repeating patterns (e.g., alternating colors between walls) by selecting optimal phases, resulting in clean, symmetric fills that matched expected outputs.
 * Did not work for test: The periodic overwrite ignores vertical consistency, leading to desynchronized patterns across rows (e.g., offsets in 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s); also, it treats all non-dominant colors uniformly, potentially erasing distinct sub-objects like isolated 1s or 2-pairs.
 * The fallback to side color fill works for empty inners but is applied too broadly when runs are absent or sparse.
 * Run length analysis assumes max frequent run defines period, which fits training but fails when test has irregular or multi-period patterns (e.g., combined motifs like 2-2 pairs interrupted by bg).
 * No vertical processing: Rows are independent, missing opportunities to propagate patterns downward for coherence.
 * Counter for non-bg non-side is helpful for selecting c, but most_common(1) ignores ties or low counts, which may pick wrong dominant in noisy test sections.
 * Deep copy via [row[:] for row in g] is correct and prevents input mutation.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all components (walls, runs, phase) are relevant but need tuning for subtlety like preserving short runs or multi-color sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies walls (implied by sectioned fills with 3s as sides in many rows) and applies periodic-like fills (e.g., repeating 3-8 or 3-bg patterns), but it does not look fully correct due to inconsistencies across rows.
 * Observed effects: Rows 0 and 28 are all 8s (bg borders, correct); many inner rows show attempted fills like [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] segments, suggesting solid or periodic 3-fills between walls at ~positions 0,7,14,21,28; however, sub-patterns like 1s (e.g., row 2: positions ~9-12: 1,8,1,8) and 2s (row 3: ~3-5: 2,2,8) are partially preserved but desynced (e.g., row 25 has [2,8,2,8] instead of consistent 8,2,2,8 from row 3).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have vertically aligned motifs (e.g., a consistent "ladder" of 1-8-1 across rows in one section, or symmetric 4s and 9s); instead, generated has row-specific variations (e.g., row 4 has 1,8,1,8,3 but row 5 shifts to 8,1,8,1,3; row 25 disrupts with 2,8,2,8 while others have 8,2,2,8), indicating the row-independent processing causes misalignment—likely the periodic phase isn't shared vertically.
 * 9s appear in later sections (e.g., row 4: ~24-26: 9,9,8) but inconsistently (some rows have 9,8,9 vs. 9,9,8), suggesting the run/period logic mismatches when sections have paired or clustered non-dominant colors.
 * Overall, test output is ~70% patterned but fails coherence: It overwrites too aggressively (e.g., row 14 has 4,8,4,4 which blends 4s oddly), erasing subtle interruptions; if expected is a complete, symmetric visual (e.g., shapes like letters or icons), this looks fragmented and incorrect for unknown reasons like phase selection per row instead of global.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background value (likely 8) forms walls and empty spaces, and incomplete regions between walls in each row must be filled with periodic patterns derived from a detected dominant color 'c' in that region, using predefined periods and units that repeat the color interspersed with background. The goal is to complete the grid by applying the best-fitting phase of these patterns to match or preserve existing elements while filling gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns entirely filled with the background value 's' (e.g., 8), excluding the grid edges; they divide the grid into horizontal strips per row for independent processing.
 * Regions between walls are only processed if they contain exactly one non-background color 'c' (ignoring 's'), and 'c' != 2; otherwise, skip to avoid overwriting mixed or special cases.
 * If the colors immediately adjacent to the walls (sides) match and are non-background, treat them as preserved anchors and exclude them from the fillable interior (istart/iend adjusted inward).
 * Periodic patterns use a dictionary for periods: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}, with unit = [c] * (p-1) + [s]; this creates repeating motifs like [3,3,8] for c=3, p=3.
 * Best phase selection prioritizes maximum matches to the existing row, then maximum preservation of 'c' in positions expecting 'c', with ties broken by lowest phase index.
 * Apply patterns only to the interior (istart to iend); walls and sides remain untouched.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical consistency enforced across rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns copy; single-cell regions or left > right skipped; multiple colors or c=2 skip (2 may be a special "do not fill" or irregular pattern).
 * Subtlety: The program modifies a copy (new_g) to avoid in-place changes affecting checks; assumes rectangular grid.
 * Potential miss: If a region has no colors (all 's'), it skips, leaving empty; if side colors don't match, full region is considered without preservation.
 * Period dict includes 8 (background), but since c != s, it's unused; may be vestigial.

        new_row[jj] = unit[idx]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, applying patterns to single-color regions and preserving sides where applicable.
 * Worked well for simple periodic fills like c=3 with [3,3,8] repeats, as seen in row 2 and 28 of test output.
 * Did not work for mixed-color regions (e.g., containing 1,2,4,9), leaving them mostly unchanged, which may be correct if puzzle rules skip non-uniform areas but results in incomplete test output.
 * Skipped c=2 regions entirely, preserving 2s (e.g., rows 4,7,10 with [2,2] pairs), which seems intentional but may miss if 2 requires a different period (undefined in dict).
 * Wall detection worked, as output shows consistent 8s in wall positions and divisions.
 * Side preservation logic applied in some cases (e.g., symmetric 3s next to walls), but failed or skipped where sides mismatched, leading to full-region attempts that may overwrite incorrectly if colors >1.
 * Phase selection preserved some existing 1s/4s/9s (e.g., row 3 keeps 1s and 4s), but introduced mismatches like scattered 8s in pattern areas.
 * Overall, program understands core filling but may over-skip complex regions; no vertical propagation, which could be a miss if puzzle requires row consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_walls, get_colors, etc.) are relevant and functional, though period_dict lacks entry for 2 (intentional skip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: Top/bottom rows all 8s (background, correct); rows 2/28 show filled [3,3,3,3,3,3] patterns between 8 walls, matching p=3 unit [3,3,8] but with extra 3s (possibly phase 0 or overfill).
 * Middle rows retain input-like mixtures (e.g., row 3: 1s,4s,3s,8s scattered), suggesting skips for multi-color regions, but this leaves the grid incomplete/unchanged in key areas, unlike uniform training fills—expected more pattern imposition on 1/4/9 zones.
 * Patterns for c=3 appear in segments (e.g., row 3 has 3-8-3 repeats), but 2s (e.g., row 4: [2,2]) and 9s (row 5: [9,8,9]) are preserved without filling, which may be wrong if they need periods (2 undefined, 9 uses p=2: [9,8]).
 * Inconsistencies: Row 25 has [8,8,2,8,...] differing from similar rows (e.g., row 4 [8,2,2,8]), suggesting partial application or input variation, but overall lacks full periodicity (e.g., 1s not converted to [1,8] repeats).
 * Output does not look fully correct: Expected smoother, repeating patterns across all eligible regions (e.g., 1s to [1,8], 4s to [4,8], 9s to [9,8]), but instead mixes originals with partial 8/3 inserts; differs from training success by not transforming diverse colors uniformly—likely skips too aggressively on multi-color or c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

    return best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a 2D grid (likely representing a partially filled image or pattern with numeric "colors") by identifying vertical "wall" columns fully occupied by a background value (s, often 8), then filling the spaces between walls in each row with either solid dominant colors or periodic patterns based on predefined periods for specific colors (1,3,4,8,9), while ignoring or skipping certain values like 2 (possibly placeholders or errors) and ensuring majority dominance.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns where EVERY row has the background value s; partial walls (e.g., 8s in some but not all rows) do not qualify and should not be treated as boundaries.
 * Between walls, shrink the fillable region if the immediate side cells (istart and iend) match a non-s, non-2 color, treating them as fixed "frames" to avoid overwriting structural elements.
 * Dominant color detection ignores s and 2 values, requires >50% majority of non-ignored cells, and only considers valid colors {1,3,4,8,9}; if no dominant, skip filling that segment.
 * Patterns are periodic with fixed periods per color (e.g., 1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2), consisting of (p-1) instances of the color followed by one s (background for separation?); choose the phase that maximizes matches to the current row segment.
 * Compare periodic pattern matches to solid fills of the dominant color, applying whichever fits better (higher match count); this handles cases where the row is already mostly solid vs. patterned.
 * 2 values seem to act as "unknown" or "to-be-filled" placeholders that are skipped in analysis but should be overwritten during filling if they fall in the segment—persisting 2s indicate incomplete filling or mismatched segments.
 * Grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) are always treated as implicit walls.
 * Processing is row-by-row and segment-by-segment, modifying a copy of the grid; no vertical or global consistency enforcement across rows, which might miss multi-row patterns.
 * Subtle: Patterns cycle with phase shift, so alignment matters; solid fill can override if it matches more, but this might over-simplify irregular segments.
 * Potential miss: If a segment has mixed valid colors without >50% dominance, it skips, leaving 2s or originals intact—could lead to incomplete grids.
 * Periods are hardcoded and color-specific, implying the puzzle has predefined "textures" (e.g., 3 might be a dotted pattern with period 3).
 * No handling for horizontal walls or 2D connectivity; assumes independent row fills.
 * s is dynamically set from g[0][0], assuming uniform background.

    # Key for deciding what to fill; ignores 2s correctly but skips if no strong dominant.

    if not vals:
        return -1
    cnt = Counter(vals)
    most_c, count = cnt.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5 and most_c in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:

    # Generates a repeating pattern for a color with period p (e.g., [c, s] for p=2); essential for textured fills.
    return [c] * (p - 1) + [s]
```

def get_best_phase(g: List[List[int]], r: int, istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], p: int) -> int:
    # Tries all phases of the pattern to find the best fit (max matches) in the segment; returns phase and match count.
    # Note: The provided code returns a tuple, but usage expects two values—fixed in implementation.
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(p):
        matches = sum(1 for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] == pattern[(j - istart + phase) % p])
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase, best_matches
```

```python
# Solid and pattern application functions (apply_solid, apply_pattern) are helpful for modifying segments directly.
# period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2} is a useful hardcoded mapping for color-to-period.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but get_solid_matches and the phase function assume exact matches including to s in patterns—might overcount if 2s are present, as they won't match c or s but aren't skipped in matching logic. No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-s, non-2); the code treats rows independently, which may not capture 2D shapes—future attempts might need blob extraction for vertical alignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating solid handling of wall detection, dominant color selection, and pattern/solid choice for simpler cases.
 * Worked well for cases with clear vertical walls and uniform row segments, as evidenced by correct training outputs.
 * What worked: Accurate wall finding (includes edges), dominant color with >50% threshold prevents false fills, phase selection maximizes fit, comparison to solid fill chooses better option, side-frame shrinking preserves boundaries.
 * What didn't work: In complex tests, 2s persist in output (e.g., positions like columns 3-4 in several rows), suggesting segments containing 2s either skipped (no dominant) or patterns didn't overwrite them effectively—unknown why, possibly because 2s dilute dominance or segments are too narrow/mixed.
 * Missed potential vertical consistency: Fills are per-row, but test output shows repeating row patterns (e.g., every 3 rows similar), hinting at multi-row objects that need cross-row propagation.
 * Side matching skips too aggressively if istart/iend are 2s (not handled, as side check is !=s and equal), potentially leaving narrow segments unfilled.
 * No handling for 8 as a fillable color in patterns (period 4), but test has many 8s—might over-apply solids.
 * Training successes suggest core segmentation and filling logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in mixed/2-heavy segments.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies major walls (e.g., edges all 8s, some internal full-8 columns implied), fills many segments with patterns (e.g., repeating 3s in row 1 between walls, 1-8-1 patterns around columns 9-12, 4-8-4 or solid 4s around 16-19, 9-8-9 later), and shows repetition across rows (e.g., rows 2-4, 6-8 similar with 2s in cols 3-4, 1s in 9-12, etc.), suggesting it's rendering a multi-row image like letters or icons.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Persistent 2s in specific positions (e.g., rows 3,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,19,21,22,24,25: columns 3-4 often 2,2; row 24 has 8,2 in col 3) indicate unfilled or skipped areas—these should likely be overwritten by patterns/solids if in valid segments, but weren't, possibly because 2s prevent dominance (>50% fails) or segments exclude them via side logic.
 * Repetitive structure (e.g., every other row has 8,8,8 in cols 3-5 vs. 2,2) looks like an attempt to draw shapes (perhaps "E" or bars with 3/1/4/9), but inconsistencies like row 24's partial 2 suggest incomplete processing—expected output should eliminate all 2s for a clean pattern.
 * Solid fills appear in places (e.g., row 1 all 8s outside, 3s in segments), but patterned areas have s=8 insertions that might disrupt if phase is wrong; test has many such, but if expected is smoother solids, this over-applies patterns.
 * Overall, output is better than raw input (assuming input had more 2s), but lingering 2s and row variations without vertical alignment mean it's not matching a coherent final image—needs better 2-handling or cross-row logic to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background color B (likely 8 in the test) forms vertical walls (full-height columns), dividing the grid into horizontal sections that need to be cleaned or filled based on detected patterns of a single foreground color S (from a limited set like 1-4,9). The goal is to identify repeating block patterns of S separated by B or solid fills of S in the inner parts of sections, choosing the best fit to minimize errors and maximize matches against the noisy input.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with B; they include the grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) and any internal full-B columns, and they remain unchanged.
 * Sections between walls (subrows) may have optional side decorations (matching colors at the start/end, not B), so the "inner" is the subrow excluding those sides if they exist and match.
 * For filling to apply, the inner must contain exactly one unique non-B, non-side color (S), and S must be in {1,2,3,4,8,9} (but 8 is B, so effectively 1-4,9); multiple candidates or invalid S skips the section.
 * Patterns are horizontal: compute consecutive block lengths of S in the inner (ignoring non-S), find the mode (most frequent) block size K (max if ties), then test phases (0 to K) for a repeating cycle of K S's followed by 1 B, scoring by mismatches (non-2 cells not matching expected S/B) and presences (existing S where expected).
 * Compare pattern score to solid S fill score (mismatches: non-S non-2 cells; presences: existing S cells); prefer solid if equal mismatches but more presences, or strictly fewer mismatches; 2 seems to be a wildcard/unknown that doesn't count as mismatch.
 * Filling modifies the inner in-place and copies back to the row, but only if conditions met; empty inners or no blocks skip.
 * Process each row independently, but walls are global (same for all rows); unchanged cells (noise like stray 1,2,4,9) persist if no pattern detected.
 * Subtle: Block counting skips non-S cells without counting them as separators (only consecutive S runs); mode K=0 skips. Phases wrap modulo (K+1). Side colors block inner if present and non-B.
 * Edge cases: Zero-length subrows/inners skip; ties in mode take max K; best phase prefers lower ph on tie. B is assumed g[0][0], but should verify consistency.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal changes: only fill sections with strong single-S evidence, preferring patterns that align with existing data over solid fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations detailed, but it builds on pattern recognition logic that succeeded on training.
 * What worked: Correctly identified and filled simple horizontal sections with single S and clear block modes in training examples 1 and 2 (full correctness), demonstrating solid wall detection, candidate S filtering, mode computation, phase/solid comparison, and in-place filling/rebasing.
 * What didn't work: In the test, filling is incomplete—many sections remain noisy (e.g., scattered 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s persist), suggesting skips due to multiple candidates in inners, invalid S, or no blocks/mode=0; horizontal-only processing may miss vertical or diagonal patterns if the puzzle has them (unknown, but output irregularity hints at this). Side color detection works but may over-exclude inners in complex sections. No global consistency check across rows (e.g., same S/pattern per section vertically), leading to row-by-row inconsistencies like filled 3-strips in rows 1/27 but noisy middles. Block counting ignores non-S as separators, which may fail if noise creates false short blocks. S set includes 8 (B), but logic skips it anyway—redundant but harmless.
 * The main program loop correctly sections per row using global walls and handles side/inner extraction, but skips too conservatively (e.g., if any inner has extra colors like 1+4, whole section untouched).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though compute_best_phase assumes horizontal linearity—may need vertical extension if patterns align column-wise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves wall columns (likely positions with all 8s) as 8s, fills some horizontal strips with clean groups of 3s (e.g., row 1: repeating 6x3 +8; row 27 similar), and preserves edges/full-8 rows (0 and 28), indicating successful detection of S=3 in simple sections with mode K~6.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: middle rows (e.g., 2-26) retain heavy noise like isolated 1s, pairs of 2s, blocks of 4s, and 9s (e.g., row 2: 8,3,8,1,8,1,8,1,...; row 4: ...9,9,8,...), which weren't filled, suggesting the program skipped due to multiple candidates (1,2,4,9 all present in some inners) or low block evidence; this leaves the grid patchy/inconsistent vertically (e.g., column ~3 has 3 in row1 but 1/2 in row2-3). Expected output should likely clean more sections to uniform S/B patterns (perhaps S=3 dominant, with vertical alignment), minimizing all noise—current output has ~20-30% unclean cells per noisy row, far from a "solved" puzzle. Unknown if input had vertical patterns requiring cross-row logic, but output's row-variation implies the horizontal-only approach misses this, producing suboptimal fills.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:15:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram, picross, or chamber-filling puzzle) where the input is a partially completed grid of integers representing colors or states (e.g., background B, walls, clues, and blanks marked as 2 or other values), and the goal is to complete it by identifying structural elements like walls and filling chambers with periodic or solid patterns based on dominant values and block modes, while preserving or resolving clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B (often the top-left value, e.g., 8) represents empty or wall space; walls are full vertical columns of B separating chambers.
 * Blanks are likely marked as 2; "stray" 2s (isolated or in rows without a 2 in position 1) must be converted to B early to avoid false patterns.
 * Chambers are subsections between walls (including left/right edges); sides of chambers may match (same non-B value), in which case inner filling skips the sides; otherwise, include everything.
 * Within a chamber, ignore B and side values to find the most common inner value c (e.g., 3); then compute the mode (most frequent) block length K of consecutive c's.
 * Filling strategy: Prefer a periodic pattern of K c's followed by 1 B (period p = K+1), testing all phases to minimize mismatches; apply only if it improves over a solid fill of c; otherwise, default to solid c.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks of c, skip filling (K=0); handle empty or zero-length chambers; patterns may not apply if no valid inner values; multiple colors (e.g., 1,4,9) in input suggest chambers may have mixed clues that shouldn't all be overwritten by one c—program risks forcing dominant c (like 3) across diverse areas.
 * Easy to miss: Walls must be strictly full B columns (no partials); mode K takes the maximum among ties; filling is row-by-row but chamber-wide, so vertical consistency across rows is crucial but not enforced; input may have pre-filled clues (non-2, non-B) that should guide c but not be blindly overwritten if they mismatch the pattern.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes (h x w), empty grids, and ensure output is a deep copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Considerations from attempts: Periodic filling may fail on irregular clue placements (e.g., scattered 1s/4s/9s), leading to partial overwrites; solid fill fallback might over-simplify complex chambers; no vertical propagation, so row-independent filling can create inconsistent columns.

            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    k_count = Counter(blocks)
    max_freq = max(k_count.values())
    cand_k = [k for k, f in k_count.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(cand_k)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both by properly identifying walls, cleaning 2s, and applying periodic or solid fills in simple chambers.
 * Worked well for uniform or low-variety chambers where a single dominant c (e.g., 3) and clear block modes led to minimal mismatches.
 * Did not handle test input effectively: Over-relied on row[1] for stray 2 detection, which may miss row-specific blanks; chamber filling forced dominant c=3 across diverse areas, leaving clues like 1,4,9 intact instead of resolving them.
 * find_walls is helpful and correct for vertical full-B detection but assumes no partial walls—may miss subtle boundaries in test.
 * get_mode_k is essential for periodic pattern detection but only scans one row per chamber, ignoring vertical consistency; ties in mode are resolved by max K, which may bias toward longer blocks incorrectly.
 * Main program mutates temp_g in-place per row, which works for horizontal patterns but fails to propagate vertically, leading to inconsistent chambers.
 * fill_stray_twos is somewhat helpful for initial cleanup but overly simplistic (relies on row[1]==2 as a flag, which may not generalize); unhelpful in tests with no 2s or scattered blanks.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core wall/chamber logic; however, the phase-testing loop for periodic fill is unhelpful if inner_len is small or clues are dense, as it doesn't penalize clue mismatches enough.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it generates a highly repetitive grid (e.g., rows 2-26 mirror patterns like [8, 3, 8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,...] with minor variations in 4s and 9s), suggesting the program applied the same dominant c=3 and partial periodic fills across most rows without vertical alignment or full resolution.
 * Expected: A coherent completed grid where chambers are uniformly filled (solid or periodic) based on clues, resolving all non-B/2 values into patterns without leftovers; instead, scattered 1s, 4s, and 9s remain (e.g., positions with 1s in columns ~9-12, 4s in ~16-20, 9s in ~24-26), indicating the program skipped filling or mismatched them as non-dominant, leaving "stray" clues unfilled.
 * Repetition across ~25 rows implies per-row processing without cross-row enforcement, creating artificial symmetry not present in a logical puzzle solution; top/bottom rows are solid 8s and 3s, which might be correct for borders, but inner rows should vary more if input had diverse clues.
 * Different from expected: No full overwriting of mixed clues (e.g., 4s and 9s should integrate into c-patterns or be treated as B if mismatched, not left as-is); the output has too many unresolved positions (e.g., row 4 has 9s at end, but row 5 shifts them), suggesting phase selection failed to minimize errors globally—unknown why, but likely due to Counter ignoring vertical context.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense for simple horizontal fills but not for a full puzzle solution, as it appears incomplete and inconsistent vertically; account for multi-color clues and vertical mode computation in future to handle this.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 15:15:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where rows represent patterns to be "resolved" or filled by adjusting blocks of a specific value S (non-background, non-border numbers like 1,3,8,9) based on the most common consecutive block length K of S in the inner row (excluding borders), while preserving border patterns of 2's and background B (like 4 or 8). The goal is to standardize S blocks to match K by splitting excess triples, filling gaps between S blocks proportionally or based on adjacent block sizes, and handling special end-of-row cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are fixed: Positions 0 and width-1 are always B; inner borders at 1 and width-2 are often 2's that should not be changed unless part of a specific rule, and rows with all-inner-2's or all-B are skipped.
 * S is dynamically chosen from unique inner values excluding B and 2; multiple S per row are processed sequentially, but only if K > 0 (i.e., S appears in blocks).
 * Core rule: Compute K as the mode (most common) length of consecutive S blocks in positions 2 to width-3; if no blocks, skip S.
 * Splitting: Any triple (or more) of S has the middle set to B to break into smaller blocks closer to K.
 * Gap filling: For double non-S gaps between S blocks, fill one side based on adjacent block sizes vs. K (prefer filling the side with smaller adjacent block; if equal, bias left or right); for triple non-S gaps flanked by S, fill the middle one.
 * End specials: Handle near-end doubles of S by setting the last to B; special case for non-S double followed by S double near end with trailing 2, by swapping/adjusting to S and B.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—split triples first, then fill gaps; avoid changing borders (1 < pos < width-1 only); K is only from inner blocks (start=2, end=width-3), ignoring potential edge blocks; rows with uniform inner 2's are skipped even if they have S elsewhere; multiple S types per row (e.g., 1 and 3 in same grid) are handled separately but may interact if positions overlap; all-B rows are unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Mode K ignores singletons or non-consecutive; gap filling considers full adjacent block sizes (chaining left/right from gap); special end rule only if width >=7 and exact pattern match; after filling, new blocks may not trigger re-computation of K (one-pass per row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Grids have repeating row patterns (e.g., every 5 rows: full B, 2-border, pattern, pattern, 2-border); test grid is wider (29 cols vs. 22), with mixed S (1,3,4,9) and 2's inside patterns; vertical alignment suggests column-wise consistency, but rules are row-only; 2's can appear mid-pattern (e.g., as separators or unfilled gaps) and should remain unless explicitly filled to S.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_mode_block_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, S: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the most common block length of consecutive S in row[start:end+1].
    Returns 0 if no blocks found. Useful for determining K per S type.
    """
    blocks = []
    j = start
    while j <= end:
        if row[j] == S:
            size = 0
            while j <= end and row[j] == S:
                size += 1
                j += 1
            blocks.append(size)
        else:
            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The above function is helpful and correctly extracts block modes, used in the main program for K. No other types or tools from attempts; the main program loop is a basic row processor but needs refinement for gap logic and end cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it correctly handled training example 1 (likely a simpler pattern with consistent filling).
 * Failed training example 2: For 8's in rows 12-14, generated split some triples (e.g., row 12 has 8,4,8,8,8 instead of expected 8,4,8,8,8—wait, actually mismatched by not filling enough to make consistent triples of 3, leaving isolated 8's and 4's where expected has merged 8,8,8 blocks separated by single 4's; specifically, positions like 4-6 should be 8,8,8 but generated 4,8,8,8; similar under-filling in later groups). For 9's in rows 17-19, no filling occurred at all (generated keeps 9,4,9 patterns unchanged, but expected also unchanged—wait, expected matches generated for 9's, so failure is isolated to 8's where mode K=3 was not fully applied to gaps). Overall, splitting worked partially, but gap filling logic (double/triple non-S) was incomplete or miscalculated adjacent sizes, leading to asymmetric or missed fills.
 * extract_objects not present or relevant (no object extraction; puzzle is block-based, not blob/object detection—don't use in future).
 * The special end double non-S double S rule fired incorrectly or not at all in some rows, as seen in partial matches.
 * Mode computation skipped edges correctly but may have missed chaining in gap size calc (e.g., left_size/right_size while loops are good but conditionals for change_pos are buggy, preferring wrong side when sizes equal or <K).
 * Train 2 mismatches in 8's for unknown reason in exact gap positions (e.g., expected row 13 has 8,8,8,4,8,8,8 but generated 8,8,8,4,8,4,8—inserted extra 4's or failed to fill).
 * Triple split rule over-applied or under-applied in dense areas, creating unintended small blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply partial splitting and minimal filling, leaving many irregular patterns unfilled (e.g., row 2 has 3,8,3,8 patterns but expected likely standardizes 3-blocks to a mode K, perhaps filling gaps to triples like in train 2's 8's; instead, it keeps scattered 3's with 8's as B). 
 * In rows with 1's (e.g., row 3: 3,8,1,8,8,3), no apparent filling of gaps around 1's, and 2's mid-row (e.g., 2,2 near pos 3-4) remain but may need S-fill if part of gap; expected probably merges 1's into consistent blocks separated by B.
 * 4's and 9's show uneven treatment: row 5 has 4,8,4,4 but scattered; 9's in later rows (e.g., row 5: 9,9) partially filled but not to mode (test has many 9,8,9,8 patterns unchanged, suggesting K=1 mode not triggering fills, but likely K=2 or more from context). 
 * Overall, output retains too much original irregularity (e.g., vertical columns don't align to consistent block patterns as in expected train 2), with 2's inside possibly unfilled gaps; it makes sense as a partial application but not correct, missing proportional gap fills and full standardization per S (e.g., 3's should likely be triples like train 2's 3's/8's). 
 * To handle test, need better multi-S interaction (e.g., 4's seem like another S, but program treats as possible S only if not B/2— in test B=8, so 4 is S but underfilled) and wider grid edge cases (width=29, more room for complex gaps).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based floor plan with walls (likely value 8), floors (likely value 3), and enclosed rooms containing tile patterns that are partially corrupted or inconsistent; the goal is to detect rooms and correct their internal patterns to a consistent repeating motif of a dominant color (C) in groups of size K followed by a single wall tile (W), using the minimal-difference phase-shifted periodic pattern that best fits the existing tiles.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are detected by finding columns with value W (8) in the floor row (row 1), assuming vertical symmetry and consistent wall positions across the grid height.
 * Rooms are segments between consecutive wall columns, excluding leading/trailing floor tiles (F=3) to focus on the "pattern segment"; borders (rows 0, h-2, h-1) and floor (row 1) are skipped to avoid modifying structural elements.
 * A room is only processed if its pattern segment uses exactly one non-W/non-F color (C); multiple colors cause skipping, which misses corrupted rooms needing unification.
 * Group sizes of consecutive C tiles in the segment are computed; the most frequent size K is used to define the period p = K + 1 (K C's + 1 W), and phase shifts (s from 0 to p-1) are tested to find the repeating pattern minimizing mismatches (diffs) with the current row.
 * Correction is applied only if it improves the row (min_diff > 0), but the code requires the expected first tile to match the actual first tile in the segment for a phase to be considered, which may overly restrict valid fits.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a room share the same pattern logic independently (no vertical alignment or multi-row consistency enforced), and patterns are horizontal-only per row.
 * Easy to miss: Floor row (row 1) has mixed F and W, used solely for wall detection; top/bottom borders are all W; rooms may have initial F padding; if no groups of C or multiple K frequencies, no correction happens.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns must repeat with exact period, but code allows only the most frequent K (or ties), potentially missing blended or evolving patterns; no handling for vertical propagation or room-wide color dominance beyond single-color check; assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

# Core logic for wall detection (helpful for identifying room boundaries consistently)
def detect_walls(grid: List[List[int]], floor_row: int = 1, w_val: int = 8) -> List[int]:
    w = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return sorted([j for j in range(w) if grid[floor_row][j] == w_val])
```

```python
# Pattern fitting logic (helpful for computing minimal-diff repeating pattern)
def fit_pattern(row_segment: List[int], c_val: int, k: int, w_val: int = 8) -> tuple[int, List[int]]:
    l = len(row_segment)
    p = k + 1
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    first_val = row_segment[0]
    for s in range(p):
        exp_first_pos = s % p
        exp_first = c_val if exp_first_pos < k else w_val
        if exp_first != first_val:
            continue
        this_diff = 0
        this_pattern = []
        for ii in range(l):
            pos = (ii + s) % p
            exp = c_val if pos < k else w_val
            if exp != row_segment[ii]:
                this_diff += 1
            this_pattern.append(exp)
        if this_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = this_diff
            best_pattern = this_pattern
    return min_diff, best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous program correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 by identifying single-color rooms, computing dominant K, and applying phase-shifted corrections where diffs > 0, resulting in uniform repeating patterns.
 * Worked well for rooms with exactly one C and clear group frequencies, enforcing periodicity without over-modifying borders or floors.
 * Did not work for test input: Skipped rooms with multiple colors (e.g., mixes of 1, 2, 4, 9 alongside potential C), leaving uncorrected inconsistencies like scattered 1s, 4s, and irregular 2/9 placements.
 * Phase restriction (matching first tile) may have blocked valid patterns in test rows with offset starts or leading non-C tiles.
 * No vertical consistency check, so horizontal fixes per row don't align rooms across heights, potentially missing global puzzle symmetry.
 * Counter for group sizes is helpful but only uses most frequent K; ties in frequency are handled by trying all, but blended rooms (multiple K) are ignored.
 * Wall detection from floor row is essential and correct, but assumes all walls align perfectly vertically, which holds in training but may not in more complex tests.
 * Single-color check (len(room_colors) != 1) is too strict for initialization/mixed states; training likely had pre-unified colors, but test has artifacts (1,2,4,9) needing merging to a dominant C.
 * No extraction of full objects/rooms as multi-row entities; per-row processing misses subtle vertical patterns or shared corrections.
 * The full program function is mostly helpful but broken for multi-color rooms (skips entirely) and not relevant for vertical or color-unification steps (don't reuse without fixes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to be the input grid with minimal or no changes, as rooms still contain multiple inconsistent colors (e.g., 1s and 4s in what should be unified patterns, 2s and 9s in irregular groups) instead of enforced repeating C-W motifs.
 * Specific differences: In rows like the third (index 2), output has [..., 3, 1, 8, 1, 8, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 3, ...] with scattered 1s and partial 4s, but expected would be uniform groups of a single C (e.g., all 4s in K=4 runs separated by 8s) across the room segment; similar issues in rows 4-28 with 9s misplaced (e.g., [..., 9, 9, 8, ...] vs. expected periodic 9-8 without breaks).
 * Patterns are not periodic: Group sizes vary (e.g., two 2s together, then singles), and no corrections applied, suggesting the single-color filter failed entirely for test rooms, leaving "corrupted" tiles intact.
 * Borders and floors remain unchanged (all 8s top/bottom, 3s with 8s in row 1), which is correct, but internal rooms show no improvement, unlike training where full uniformity was achieved.
 * Overall, output lacks the clean, repeating structure expected (e.g., no consistent K=3 or K=4 C blocks per room); it looks like raw input, indicating the program didn't engage correction logic for the test's complexity.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

    # per-row patterns via color sets and phase matching.

            idx = (jj - istart + best_phase) % period
            new_g[r][jj] = pattern[idx]
    return new_g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            best_p = p

(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; simple and reliable if grid is consistent.)

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Checks for bordered rows; essential for identifying candidates, but misses partial borders.)

```python
def get_inner_range(row: List[int], s: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    w = len(row)
    if w < 3:

    if row[1] == 2 and row[w - 2] == 2:
        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Core for identifying the pattern color c; strict majority threshold is a good subtlety to avoid noise, using collections.Counter.)

```python
def get_period(c: int) -> int:
    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], f: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        is_wall = True
        for i in range(h):
            if g[i][j] != f:
                is_wall = False
                break
        if is_wall:
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subinner: List[int], c: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(subinner)
    while i < n:
        if subinner[i] == c:
            length = 0
            while i < n and subinner[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

```python
def fit_pattern(subinner: List[int], c: int, f: int, g_val: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    n = len(subinner)
    if n == 0:
        return None
    u = g_val + 1
    best_dist = float('inf')
    best_preserved = -1
    best_shift = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    for shift in range(u):
        pattern = [0] * n
        for ii in range(n):
            pos = (ii + shift) % u
            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False
        if dist < best_dist:
            update = True
        elif dist == best_dist:
            if preserved > best_preserved:
                update = True
            elif preserved == best_preserved and shift < best_shift:
                update = True
        if update:
            best_dist = dist
            best_preserved = preserved
            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where background (bg) is typically the border value (e.g., 8), and the goal is to identify vertical "walls" (full bg columns) that divide the grid into sections, then complete or correct patterns within those sections by filling inner areas based on side colors, majority non-bg elements, run lengths, and periodic patterns to match an expected visual design.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns that are entirely bg from top to bottom, including the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) edges; only add internal walls if fully bg.
 * Sections between walls must have matching non-bg side colors (sub[0] == sub[-1] != bg) and length >=3 to be processed; otherwise, skip.
 * Inner area (excluding sides) is filled with side color if it contains only bg or side color; otherwise, identify the most common non-bg, non-side color (c).
 * For patterns with c, compute run lengths of consecutive c's in the inner area, find the most frequent run length (k), assume period = k + 1 (alternating c and bg), and select the phase that minimizes changes to match this periodic unit.
 * Subtleties: If no runs of c, fall back to filling with side color; multiple candidates for max_freq take the largest k; the periodic fill overwrites the inner regardless of original content, which may over-simplify complex patterns.
 * Bg is assumed to be g[0][0], but grids may have uniform borders; ensure deep copy of grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Patterns may repeat vertically across rows but can vary slightly (e.g., offsets or interruptions), so processing is row-by-row but should consider vertical consistency implicitly through shared walls.
 * Easy to miss: Short sections (<3 inner length) are skipped; if inner has no non-bg non-side, it's a solid fill; the best_phase selection uses modulo for cycling the unit [c]*k + [bg].
 * Considerations: The approach assumes horizontal periodicity only within sections; vertical alignment across rows isn't enforced, leading to potential desync; numbers like 1,2,4,9 represent distinct "objects" or sub-patterns that may need preservation or completion rather than overwriting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import copy

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == bg for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This function correctly identifies wall columns and is essential for sectioning the grid.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Full program body as provided; it handles copying, wall finding, and per-row per-section processing.
    # Useful for overall structure, but the periodic filling logic needs refinement for complex test cases.
```
(The main program integrates wall finding with pattern completion; the run length and phase selection parts are key but may overfit simple cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully passed both training examples by correctly identifying walls, filling solid sections with side colors, and applying periodic patterns based on run analysis for repeating motifs.
 * Worked well for training: Handled simple repeating patterns (e.g., alternating colors between walls) by selecting optimal phases, resulting in clean, symmetric fills that matched expected outputs.
 * Did not work for test: The periodic overwrite ignores vertical consistency, leading to desynchronized patterns across rows (e.g., offsets in 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s); also, it treats all non-dominant colors uniformly, potentially erasing distinct sub-objects like isolated 1s or 2-pairs.
 * The fallback to side color fill works for empty inners but is applied too broadly when runs are absent or sparse.
 * Run length analysis assumes max frequent run defines period, which fits training but fails when test has irregular or multi-period patterns (e.g., combined motifs like 2-2 pairs interrupted by bg).
 * No vertical processing: Rows are independent, missing opportunities to propagate patterns downward for coherence.
 * Counter for non-bg non-side is helpful for selecting c, but most_common(1) ignores ties or low counts, which may pick wrong dominant in noisy test sections.
 * Deep copy via [row[:] for row in g] is correct and prevents input mutation.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all components (walls, runs, phase) are relevant but need tuning for subtlety like preserving short runs or multi-color sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies walls (implied by sectioned fills with 3s as sides in many rows) and applies periodic-like fills (e.g., repeating 3-8 or 3-bg patterns), but it does not look fully correct due to inconsistencies across rows.
 * Observed effects: Rows 0 and 28 are all 8s (bg borders, correct); many inner rows show attempted fills like [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] segments, suggesting solid or periodic 3-fills between walls at ~positions 0,7,14,21,28; however, sub-patterns like 1s (e.g., row 2: positions ~9-12: 1,8,1,8) and 2s (row 3: ~3-5: 2,2,8) are partially preserved but desynced (e.g., row 25 has [2,8,2,8] instead of consistent 8,2,2,8 from row 3).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have vertically aligned motifs (e.g., a consistent "ladder" of 1-8-1 across rows in one section, or symmetric 4s and 9s); instead, generated has row-specific variations (e.g., row 4 has 1,8,1,8,3 but row 5 shifts to 8,1,8,1,3; row 25 disrupts with 2,8,2,8 while others have 8,2,2,8), indicating the row-independent processing causes misalignment—likely the periodic phase isn't shared vertically.
 * 9s appear in later sections (e.g., row 4: ~24-26: 9,9,8) but inconsistently (some rows have 9,8,9 vs. 9,9,8), suggesting the run/period logic mismatches when sections have paired or clustered non-dominant colors.
 * Overall, test output is ~70% patterned but fails coherence: It overwrites too aggressively (e.g., row 14 has 4,8,4,4 which blends 4s oddly), erasing subtle interruptions; if expected is a complete, symmetric visual (e.g., shapes like letters or icons), this looks fragmented and incorrect for unknown reasons like phase selection per row instead of global.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background value (likely 8) forms walls and empty spaces, and incomplete regions between walls in each row must be filled with periodic patterns derived from a detected dominant color 'c' in that region, using predefined periods and units that repeat the color interspersed with background. The goal is to complete the grid by applying the best-fitting phase of these patterns to match or preserve existing elements while filling gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns entirely filled with the background value 's' (e.g., 8), excluding the grid edges; they divide the grid into horizontal strips per row for independent processing.
 * Regions between walls are only processed if they contain exactly one non-background color 'c' (ignoring 's'), and 'c' != 2; otherwise, skip to avoid overwriting mixed or special cases.
 * If the colors immediately adjacent to the walls (sides) match and are non-background, treat them as preserved anchors and exclude them from the fillable interior (istart/iend adjusted inward).
 * Periodic patterns use a dictionary for periods: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}, with unit = [c] * (p-1) + [s]; this creates repeating motifs like [3,3,8] for c=3, p=3.
 * Best phase selection prioritizes maximum matches to the existing row, then maximum preservation of 'c' in positions expecting 'c', with ties broken by lowest phase index.
 * Apply patterns only to the interior (istart to iend); walls and sides remain untouched.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical consistency enforced across rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns copy; single-cell regions or left > right skipped; multiple colors or c=2 skip (2 may be a special "do not fill" or irregular pattern).
 * Subtlety: The program modifies a copy (new_g) to avoid in-place changes affecting checks; assumes rectangular grid.
 * Potential miss: If a region has no colors (all 's'), it skips, leaving empty; if side colors don't match, full region is considered without preservation.
 * Period dict includes 8 (background), but since c != s, it's unused; may be vestigial.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, applying patterns to single-color regions and preserving sides where applicable.
 * Worked well for simple periodic fills like c=3 with [3,3,8] repeats, as seen in row 2 and 28 of test output.
 * Did not work for mixed-color regions (e.g., containing 1,2,4,9), leaving them mostly unchanged, which may be correct if puzzle rules skip non-uniform areas but results in incomplete test output.
 * Skipped c=2 regions entirely, preserving 2s (e.g., rows 4,7,10 with [2,2] pairs), which seems intentional but may miss if 2 requires a different period (undefined in dict).
 * Wall detection worked, as output shows consistent 8s in wall positions and divisions.
 * Side preservation logic applied in some cases (e.g., symmetric 3s next to walls), but failed or skipped where sides mismatched, leading to full-region attempts that may overwrite incorrectly if colors >1.
 * Phase selection preserved some existing 1s/4s/9s (e.g., row 3 keeps 1s and 4s), but introduced mismatches like scattered 8s in pattern areas.
 * Overall, program understands core filling but may over-skip complex regions; no vertical propagation, which could be a miss if puzzle requires row consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_walls, get_colors, etc.) are relevant and functional, though period_dict lacks entry for 2 (intentional skip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: Top/bottom rows all 8s (background, correct); rows 2/28 show filled [3,3,3,3,3,3] patterns between 8 walls, matching p=3 unit [3,3,8] but with extra 3s (possibly phase 0 or overfill).
 * Middle rows retain input-like mixtures (e.g., row 3: 1s,4s,3s,8s scattered), suggesting skips for multi-color regions, but this leaves the grid incomplete/unchanged in key areas, unlike uniform training fills—expected more pattern imposition on 1/4/9 zones.
 * Patterns for c=3 appear in segments (e.g., row 3 has 3-8-3 repeats), but 2s (e.g., row 4: [2,2]) and 9s (row 5: [9,8,9]) are preserved without filling, which may be wrong if they need periods (2 undefined, 9 uses p=2: [9,8]).
 * Inconsistencies: Row 25 has [8,8,2,8,...] differing from similar rows (e.g., row 4 [8,2,2,8]), suggesting partial application or input variation, but overall lacks full periodicity (e.g., 1s not converted to [1,8] repeats).
 * Output does not look fully correct: Expected smoother, repeating patterns across all eligible regions (e.g., 1s to [1,8], 4s to [4,8], 9s to [9,8]), but instead mixes originals with partial 8/3 inserts; differs from training success by not transforming diverse colors uniformly—likely skips too aggressively on multi-color or c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram, picross, or chamber-filling puzzle) where the input is a partially completed grid of integers representing colors or states (e.g., background B, walls, clues, and blanks marked as 2 or other values), and the goal is to complete it by identifying structural elements like walls and filling chambers with periodic or solid patterns based on dominant values and block modes, while preserving or resolving clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B (often the top-left value, e.g., 8) represents empty or wall space; walls are full vertical columns of B separating chambers.
 * Blanks are likely marked as 2; "stray" 2s (isolated or in rows without a 2 in position 1) must be converted to B early to avoid false patterns.
 * Chambers are subsections between walls (including left/right edges); sides of chambers may match (same non-B value), in which case inner filling skips the sides; otherwise, include everything.
 * Within a chamber, ignore B and side values to find the most common inner value c (e.g., 3); then compute the mode (most frequent) block length K of consecutive c's.
 * Filling strategy: Prefer a periodic pattern of K c's followed by 1 B (period p = K+1), testing all phases to minimize mismatches; apply only if it improves over a solid fill of c; otherwise, default to solid c.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks of c, skip filling (K=0); handle empty or zero-length chambers; patterns may not apply if no valid inner values; multiple colors (e.g., 1,4,9) in input suggest chambers may have mixed clues that shouldn't all be overwritten by one c—program risks forcing dominant c (like 3) across diverse areas.
 * Easy to miss: Walls must be strictly full B columns (no partials); mode K takes the maximum among ties; filling is row-by-row but chamber-wide, so vertical consistency across rows is crucial but not enforced; input may have pre-filled clues (non-2, non-B) that should guide c but not be blindly overwritten if they mismatch the pattern.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes (h x w), empty grids, and ensure output is a deep copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Considerations from attempts: Periodic filling may fail on irregular clue placements (e.g., scattered 1s/4s/9s), leading to partial overwrites; solid fill fallback might over-simplify complex chambers; no vertical propagation, so row-independent filling can create inconsistent columns.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both by properly identifying walls, cleaning 2s, and applying periodic or solid fills in simple chambers.
 * Worked well for uniform or low-variety chambers where a single dominant c (e.g., 3) and clear block modes led to minimal mismatches.
 * Did not handle test input effectively: Over-relied on row[1] for stray 2 detection, which may miss row-specific blanks; chamber filling forced dominant c=3 across diverse areas, leaving clues like 1,4,9 intact instead of resolving them.
 * find_walls is helpful and correct for vertical full-B detection but assumes no partial walls—may miss subtle boundaries in test.
 * get_mode_k is essential for periodic pattern detection but only scans one row per chamber, ignoring vertical consistency; ties in mode are resolved by max K, which may bias toward longer blocks incorrectly.
 * Main program mutates temp_g in-place per row, which works for horizontal patterns but fails to propagate vertically, leading to inconsistent chambers.
 * fill_stray_twos is somewhat helpful for initial cleanup but overly simplistic (relies on row[1]==2 as a flag, which may not generalize); unhelpful in tests with no 2s or scattered blanks.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core wall/chamber logic; however, the phase-testing loop for periodic fill is unhelpful if inner_len is small or clues are dense, as it doesn't penalize clue mismatches enough.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it generates a highly repetitive grid (e.g., rows 2-26 mirror patterns like [8, 3, 8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,...] with minor variations in 4s and 9s), suggesting the program applied the same dominant c=3 and partial periodic fills across most rows without vertical alignment or full resolution.
 * Expected: A coherent completed grid where chambers are uniformly filled (solid or periodic) based on clues, resolving all non-B/2 values into patterns without leftovers; instead, scattered 1s, 4s, and 9s remain (e.g., positions with 1s in columns ~9-12, 4s in ~16-20, 9s in ~24-26), indicating the program skipped filling or mismatched them as non-dominant, leaving "stray" clues unfilled.
 * Repetition across ~25 rows implies per-row processing without cross-row enforcement, creating artificial symmetry not present in a logical puzzle solution; top/bottom rows are solid 8s and 3s, which might be correct for borders, but inner rows should vary more if input had diverse clues.
 * Different from expected: No full overwriting of mixed clues (e.g., 4s and 9s should integrate into c-patterns or be treated as B if mismatched, not left as-is); the output has too many unresolved positions (e.g., row 4 has 9s at end, but row 5 shifts them), suggesting phase selection failed to minimize errors globally—unknown why, but likely due to Counter ignoring vertical context.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense for simple horizontal fills but not for a full puzzle solution, as it appears incomplete and inconsistent vertically; account for multi-color clues and vertical mode computation in future to handle this.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]
    min_changes = float('inf')
    max_prefix = -1
    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a 2D grid (likely representing a partially filled image or pattern with numeric "colors") by identifying vertical "wall" columns fully occupied by a background value (s, often 8), then filling the spaces between walls in each row with either solid dominant colors or periodic patterns based on predefined periods for specific colors (1,3,4,8,9), while ignoring or skipping certain values like 2 (possibly placeholders or errors) and ensuring majority dominance.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns where EVERY row has the background value s; partial walls (e.g., 8s in some but not all rows) do not qualify and should not be treated as boundaries.
 * Between walls, shrink the fillable region if the immediate side cells (istart and iend) match a non-s, non-2 color, treating them as fixed "frames" to avoid overwriting structural elements.
 * Dominant color detection ignores s and 2 values, requires >50% majority of non-ignored cells, and only considers valid colors {1,3,4,8,9}; if no dominant, skip filling that segment.
 * Patterns are periodic with fixed periods per color (e.g., 1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2), consisting of (p-1) instances of the color followed by one s (background for separation?); choose the phase that maximizes matches to the current row segment.
 * Compare periodic pattern matches to solid fills of the dominant color, applying whichever fits better (higher match count); this handles cases where the row is already mostly solid vs. patterned.
 * 2 values seem to act as "unknown" or "to-be-filled" placeholders that are skipped in analysis but should be overwritten during filling if they fall in the segment—persisting 2s indicate incomplete filling or mismatched segments.
 * Grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) are always treated as implicit walls.
 * Processing is row-by-row and segment-by-segment, modifying a copy of the grid; no vertical or global consistency enforcement across rows, which might miss multi-row patterns.
 * Subtle: Patterns cycle with phase shift, so alignment matters; solid fill can override if it matches more, but this might over-simplify irregular segments.
 * Potential miss: If a segment has mixed valid colors without >50% dominance, it skips, leaving 2s or originals intact—could lead to incomplete grids.
 * Periods are hardcoded and color-specific, implying the puzzle has predefined "textures" (e.g., 3 might be a dotted pattern with period 3).
 * No handling for horizontal walls or 2D connectivity; assumes independent row fills.
 * s is dynamically set from g[0][0], assuming uniform background.

# period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2} is a useful hardcoded mapping for color-to-period.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but get_solid_matches and the phase function assume exact matches including to s in patterns—might overcount if 2s are present, as they won't match c or s but aren't skipped in matching logic. No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-s, non-2); the code treats rows independently, which may not capture 2D shapes—future attempts might need blob extraction for vertical alignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating solid handling of wall detection, dominant color selection, and pattern/solid choice for simpler cases.
 * Worked well for cases with clear vertical walls and uniform row segments, as evidenced by correct training outputs.
 * What worked: Accurate wall finding (includes edges), dominant color with >50% threshold prevents false fills, phase selection maximizes fit, comparison to solid fill chooses better option, side-frame shrinking preserves boundaries.
 * What didn't work: In complex tests, 2s persist in output (e.g., positions like columns 3-4 in several rows), suggesting segments containing 2s either skipped (no dominant) or patterns didn't overwrite them effectively—unknown why, possibly because 2s dilute dominance or segments are too narrow/mixed.
 * Missed potential vertical consistency: Fills are per-row, but test output shows repeating row patterns (e.g., every 3 rows similar), hinting at multi-row objects that need cross-row propagation.
 * Side matching skips too aggressively if istart/iend are 2s (not handled, as side check is !=s and equal), potentially leaving narrow segments unfilled.
 * No handling for 8 as a fillable color in patterns (period 4), but test has many 8s—might over-apply solids.
 * Training successes suggest core segmentation and filling logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in mixed/2-heavy segments.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies major walls (e.g., edges all 8s, some internal full-8 columns implied), fills many segments with patterns (e.g., repeating 3s in row 1 between walls, 1-8-1 patterns around columns 9-12, 4-8-4 or solid 4s around 16-19, 9-8-9 later), and shows repetition across rows (e.g., rows 2-4, 6-8 similar with 2s in cols 3-4, 1s in 9-12, etc.), suggesting it's rendering a multi-row image like letters or icons.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Persistent 2s in specific positions (e.g., rows 3,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,19,21,22,24,25: columns 3-4 often 2,2; row 24 has 8,2 in col 3) indicate unfilled or skipped areas—these should likely be overwritten by patterns/solids if in valid segments, but weren't, possibly because 2s prevent dominance (>50% fails) or segments exclude them via side logic.
 * Repetitive structure (e.g., every other row has 8,8,8 in cols 3-5 vs. 2,2) looks like an attempt to draw shapes (perhaps "E" or bars with 3/1/4/9), but inconsistencies like row 24's partial 2 suggest incomplete processing—expected output should eliminate all 2s for a clean pattern.
 * Solid fills appear in places (e.g., row 1 all 8s outside, 3s in segments), but patterned areas have s=8 insertions that might disrupt if phase is wrong; test has many such, but if expected is smoother solids, this over-applies patterns.
 * Overall, output is better than raw input (assuming input had more 2s), but lingering 2s and row variations without vertical alignment mean it's not matching a coherent final image—needs better 2-handling or cross-row logic to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background color B (likely 8 in the test) forms vertical walls (full-height columns), dividing the grid into horizontal sections that need to be cleaned or filled based on detected patterns of a single foreground color S (from a limited set like 1-4,9). The goal is to identify repeating block patterns of S separated by B or solid fills of S in the inner parts of sections, choosing the best fit to minimize errors and maximize matches against the noisy input.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with B; they include the grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) and any internal full-B columns, and they remain unchanged.
 * Sections between walls (subrows) may have optional side decorations (matching colors at the start/end, not B), so the "inner" is the subrow excluding those sides if they exist and match.
 * For filling to apply, the inner must contain exactly one unique non-B, non-side color (S), and S must be in {1,2,3,4,8,9} (but 8 is B, so effectively 1-4,9); multiple candidates or invalid S skips the section.
 * Patterns are horizontal: compute consecutive block lengths of S in the inner (ignoring non-S), find the mode (most frequent) block size K (max if ties), then test phases (0 to K) for a repeating cycle of K S's followed by 1 B, scoring by mismatches (non-2 cells not matching expected S/B) and presences (existing S where expected).
 * Compare pattern score to solid S fill score (mismatches: non-S non-2 cells; presences: existing S cells); prefer solid if equal mismatches but more presences, or strictly fewer mismatches; 2 seems to be a wildcard/unknown that doesn't count as mismatch.
 * Filling modifies the inner in-place and copies back to the row, but only if conditions met; empty inners or no blocks skip.
 * Process each row independently, but walls are global (same for all rows); unchanged cells (noise like stray 1,2,4,9) persist if no pattern detected.
 * Subtle: Block counting skips non-S cells without counting them as separators (only consecutive S runs); mode K=0 skips. Phases wrap modulo (K+1). Side colors block inner if present and non-B.
 * Edge cases: Zero-length subrows/inners skip; ties in mode take max K; best phase prefers lower ph on tie. B is assumed g[0][0], but should verify consistency.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal changes: only fill sections with strong single-S evidence, preferring patterns that align with existing data over solid fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], B: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies global vertical wall columns (full B height, including edges); useful for sectioning all rows consistently.
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == B for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```

```python
def get_mode_k(blocks: List[int]) -> int:
    # Computes the mode (most frequent) block length K from S-runs; takes max on ties; essential for pattern period.
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    max_f = max(count.values())
    cand_ks = [k for k, f in count.items() if f == max_f]
    return max(cand_ks)
```

```python
def compute_best_phase(inner: List[int], S: int, B: int, K: int, inner_len: int) -> tuple[int, int, int]:
    # Scores all phases of the K-S +1-B pattern, tracking min mismatches (non-2 non-matching cells) and max presences (S where expected); picks best phase with tiebreakers.
    # Key for deciding pattern vs solid; treats 2 as neutral (no mismatch penalty).
    p = K + 1
    best_mis = float('inf')
    best_pres = -1
    best_ph = -1
    for ph in range(p):

            exp = S if pos_mod < K else B
            curr = inner[ii]
            if curr != 2 and curr != exp:
                mis += 1
            if curr == S and exp == S:
                pres += 1
        if (mis < best_mis or
            (mis == best_mis and (pres > best_pres or (pres == best_pres and ph < best_ph)))):
            best_mis = mis
            best_pres = pres
            best_ph = ph
    return best_ph, best_mis, best_pres
```

```python
def compute_solid(inner: List[int], S: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    # Scores solid S fill: mismatches are non-S non-2 cells, presences are existing S; simple baseline comparator.
    inner_len = len(inner)
    solid_mis = sum(1 for v in inner if v != S and v != 2)
    solid_pres = sum(1 for v in inner if v == S)
    return solid_mis, solid_pres
```

```python
def apply_pattern(inner: List[int], S: int, B: int, K: int, ph: int) -> None:
    # In-place fills inner with phased K-S +1-B pattern; modifies list directly.
    inner_len = len(inner)
    p = K + 1
    for ii in range(inner_len):

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations detailed, but it builds on pattern recognition logic that succeeded on training.
 * What worked: Correctly identified and filled simple horizontal sections with single S and clear block modes in training examples 1 and 2 (full correctness), demonstrating solid wall detection, candidate S filtering, mode computation, phase/solid comparison, and in-place filling/rebasing.
 * What didn't work: In the test, filling is incomplete—many sections remain noisy (e.g., scattered 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s persist), suggesting skips due to multiple candidates in inners, invalid S, or no blocks/mode=0; horizontal-only processing may miss vertical or diagonal patterns if the puzzle has them (unknown, but output irregularity hints at this). Side color detection works but may over-exclude inners in complex sections. No global consistency check across rows (e.g., same S/pattern per section vertically), leading to row-by-row inconsistencies like filled 3-strips in rows 1/27 but noisy middles. Block counting ignores non-S as separators, which may fail if noise creates false short blocks. S set includes 8 (B), but logic skips it anyway—redundant but harmless.
 * The main program loop correctly sections per row using global walls and handles side/inner extraction, but skips too conservatively (e.g., if any inner has extra colors like 1+4, whole section untouched).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though compute_best_phase assumes horizontal linearity—may need vertical extension if patterns align column-wise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves wall columns (likely positions with all 8s) as 8s, fills some horizontal strips with clean groups of 3s (e.g., row 1: repeating 6x3 +8; row 27 similar), and preserves edges/full-8 rows (0 and 28), indicating successful detection of S=3 in simple sections with mode K~6.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: middle rows (e.g., 2-26) retain heavy noise like isolated 1s, pairs of 2s, blocks of 4s, and 9s (e.g., row 2: 8,3,8,1,8,1,8,1,...; row 4: ...9,9,8,...), which weren't filled, suggesting the program skipped due to multiple candidates (1,2,4,9 all present in some inners) or low block evidence; this leaves the grid patchy/inconsistent vertically (e.g., column ~3 has 3 in row1 but 1/2 in row2-3). Expected output should likely clean more sections to uniform S/B patterns (perhaps S=3 dominant, with vertical alignment), minimizing all noise—current output has ~20-30% unclean cells per noisy row, far from a "solved" puzzle. Unknown if input had vertical patterns requiring cross-row logic, but output's row-variation implies the horizontal-only approach misses this, producing suboptimal fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: 'bool' object is not callable
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:18:29] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to identify background elements, detect vertical "walls" (full-height background columns), and fill inner sections between walls in each row with either a solid color or a periodic pattern based on dominant colors, while respecting special values like 2 (possibly unknowns or obstacles) and predefined periods for certain colors. The process prioritizes minimizing mismatches with existing non-background/non-2 cells and maximizing presence of the target color, with fallback logic for cases without a clear dominant color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (s) is detected as the top-left cell value, assuming uniform background; all processing skips rows without background on both edges.
 * Walls are strictly vertical full-height background columns, including edges; sections between walls are processed independently per row, but only if the row starts/ends with background.
 * Dominant color in a section is the unique non-background/non-2 color present; it must be in period_dict (e.g., {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}) to qualify for patterning, otherwise fallback applies.
 * Patterns are repeating units like [c, c, ..., s] (period-1 times c, then background s), with phase-shifting to best fit existing cells; solid fill is an alternative if it has fewer mismatches or equal mismatches but more target color presences.
 * Sections may "shrink" if side cells (adjacent to walls) match and aren't background, excluding them from inner filling to preserve borders.
 * Value 2 acts as a wildcard/unknown: ignored in dominant color detection and mismatch calculations, but preserved (not overwritten) in pattern/solid applications.
 * Fallback triggers if no dominant color: only applies if section has 2s and was shrunk, using side color for pattern/solid if valid in period_dict.
 * Processing is row-by-row, creating a deep copy of the grid; empty sections (inner_start > inner_end) are skipped.
 * Potential edge cases: all-2 sections, no valid colors, non-period colors, uneven section lengths not divisible by period, or walls creating tiny/zero-width sections.
 * The puzzle likely involves nonogram-like filling or pattern completion, where outputs should visually complete symmetric or repeating motifs without altering walls/background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies the background color from the top-left, assuming uniformity.)

```python
def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This correctly identifies vertical wall columns as full-height background lines, including fixed edges.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(start, end + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    uniq = set(vals)
    if len(uniq) != 1:
        return -1
    c = list(uniq)[0]
    if c in period_dict:
        return c
    return -1
```
(This extracts a valid dominant color for patterning, ignoring background and 2s; returns -1 if ambiguous, empty, or non-period color.)

```python
def compute_pattern_mis_and_pres(row: List[int], inner_start: int, inner_end: int, unit: List[int], p: int, c: int, s: int) -> tuple[int, int, int]:
    L = inner_end - inner_start + 1
    best_mis = float('inf')
    best_pres = -1
    best_ph = 0
    for ph in range(p):
        mis = 0
        pres = 0
        for jj in range(inner_start, inner_end + 1):
            idx = (jj - inner_start + ph) % p
            exp = unit[idx]
            if row[jj] != 2 and row[jj] != exp:
                mis += 1
            if row[jj] == c and exp == c:
                pres += 1
        if mis < best_mis or (mis == best_mis and (pres > best_pres or (pres == best_pres and ph < best_ph))):
            best_mis = mis
            best_pres = pres
            best_ph = ph
    return best_mis, best_pres, best_ph
```
(This evaluates the best phase for a periodic pattern, scoring mismatches (non-2 cells not matching expected) and color presences; useful for deciding pattern viability.)

```python
def compute_solid_mis_and_pres(row: List[int], inner_start: int, inner_end: int, c: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    mis = 0
    pres = 0
    for jj in range(inner_start, inner_end + 1):
        if row[jj] != 2 and row[jj] != c:
            mis += 1
        if row[jj] == c:
            pres += 1
    return mis, pres
```
(This scores solid fills similarly, ignoring 2s in mismatches but counting presences; pairs with pattern scorer for choice.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1 and 2 both produced correct outputs, indicating strong handling of basic wall detection, section isolation, dominant color extraction, and pattern/solid application with mismatch minimization.
 * The core logic for phase-shifting patterns and comparing to solids worked well for training cases, preserving 2s and shrinking sections appropriately.
 * Fallback logic (using side colors when no dominant) appears functional in training but untested here.
 * The execution error ('bool' object is not callable) on test input stems from a bug: `apply_solid_to_inner` is assigned a boolean (True/False) but later called as a function (e.g., `apply_solid_to_inner(new_g[r], ...)`), causing the crash; this prevents any output generation.
 * Wall finding and background detection seem robust, as they passed training without issues.
 * Section processing skips correctly for edge cases like no inner area or non-background rows.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., apply_pattern_to_inner, process_section) are relevant but the bool-as-function bug breaks integration in process_section.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates good understanding of pattern periods and scoring, but the coding error halted test execution entirely.

**Test output:**
 * No output was generated for the test input due to the execution error ('bool' object is not callable), likely occurring in process_section when attempting to call the boolean `apply_solid_to_inner` as a function after setting it to True/False based on scoring.
 * Without output, it's impossible to verify if the filled grid matches expected puzzle completion (e.g., correct patterns in sections, preserved 2s, no wall alterations); mentally simulating, the test likely involves a grid with walls, 2s, and partial patterns needing phase-aligned fills or solids, but the error means nothing was produced to compare.
 * The error suggests the test input triggered the solid-fallback path (where apply_solid_to_inner is set to a bool), which training may not have hit; this differs from expectations as training succeeded without crashing, implying test has unique section configurations (e.g., dominant color leading to solid choice).

[2025-10-03 15:18:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where rows represent patterns to be "resolved" or filled by adjusting blocks of a specific value S (non-background, non-border numbers like 1,3,8,9) based on the most common consecutive block length K of S in the inner row (excluding borders), while preserving border patterns of 2's and background B (like 4 or 8). The goal is to standardize S blocks to match K by splitting excess triples, filling gaps between S blocks proportionally or based on adjacent block sizes, and handling special end-of-row cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are fixed: Positions 0 and width-1 are always B; inner borders at 1 and width-2 are often 2's that should not be changed unless part of a specific rule, and rows with all-inner-2's or all-B are skipped.
 * S is dynamically chosen from unique inner values excluding B and 2; multiple S per row are processed sequentially, but only if K > 0 (i.e., S appears in blocks).
 * Core rule: Compute K as the mode (most common) length of consecutive S blocks in positions 2 to width-3; if no blocks, skip S.
 * Splitting: Any triple (or more) of S has the middle set to B to break into smaller blocks closer to K.
 * Gap filling: For double non-S gaps between S blocks, fill one side based on adjacent block sizes vs. K (prefer filling the side with smaller adjacent block; if equal, bias left or right); for triple non-S gaps flanked by S, fill the middle one.
 * End specials: Handle near-end doubles of S by setting the last to B; special case for non-S double followed by S double near end with trailing 2, by swapping/adjusting to S and B.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—split triples first, then fill gaps; avoid changing borders (1 < pos < width-1 only); K is only from inner blocks (start=2, end=width-3), ignoring potential edge blocks; rows with uniform inner 2's are skipped even if they have S elsewhere; multiple S types per row (e.g., 1 and 3 in same grid) are handled separately but may interact if positions overlap; all-B rows are unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Mode K ignores singletons or non-consecutive; gap filling considers full adjacent block sizes (chaining left/right from gap); special end rule only if width >=7 and exact pattern match; after filling, new blocks may not trigger re-computation of K (one-pass per row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Grids have repeating row patterns (e.g., every 5 rows: full B, 2-border, pattern, pattern, 2-border); test grid is wider (29 cols vs. 22), with mixed S (1,3,4,9) and 2's inside patterns; vertical alignment suggests column-wise consistency, but rules are row-only; 2's can appear mid-pattern (e.g., as separators or unfilled gaps) and should remain unless explicitly filled to S.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_mode_block_size(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, S: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the most common block length of consecutive S in row[start:end+1].
    Returns 0 if no blocks found. Useful for determining K per S type.
    """
    blocks = []
    j = start
    while j <= end:
        if row[j] == S:
            size = 0
            while j <= end and row[j] == S:
                size += 1
                j += 1
            blocks.append(size)
        else:
            j += 1
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    count = Counter(blocks)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The above function is helpful and correctly extracts block modes, used in the main program for K. No other types or tools from attempts; the main program loop is a basic row processor but needs refinement for gap logic and end cases.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it correctly handled training example 1 (likely a simpler pattern with consistent filling).
 * Failed training example 2: For 8's in rows 12-14, generated split some triples (e.g., row 12 has 8,4,8,8,8 instead of expected 8,4,8,8,8—wait, actually mismatched by not filling enough to make consistent triples of 3, leaving isolated 8's and 4's where expected has merged 8,8,8 blocks separated by single 4's; specifically, positions like 4-6 should be 8,8,8 but generated 4,8,8,8; similar under-filling in later groups). For 9's in rows 17-19, no filling occurred at all (generated keeps 9,4,9 patterns unchanged, but expected also unchanged—wait, expected matches generated for 9's, so failure is isolated to 8's where mode K=3 was not fully applied to gaps). Overall, splitting worked partially, but gap filling logic (double/triple non-S) was incomplete or miscalculated adjacent sizes, leading to asymmetric or missed fills.
 * extract_objects not present or relevant (no object extraction; puzzle is block-based, not blob/object detection—don't use in future).
 * The special end double non-S double S rule fired incorrectly or not at all in some rows, as seen in partial matches.
 * Mode computation skipped edges correctly but may have missed chaining in gap size calc (e.g., left_size/right_size while loops are good but conditionals for change_pos are buggy, preferring wrong side when sizes equal or <K).
 * Train 2 mismatches in 8's for unknown reason in exact gap positions (e.g., expected row 13 has 8,8,8,4,8,8,8 but generated 8,8,8,4,8,4,8—inserted extra 4's or failed to fill).
 * Triple split rule over-applied or under-applied in dense areas, creating unintended small blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply partial splitting and minimal filling, leaving many irregular patterns unfilled (e.g., row 2 has 3,8,3,8 patterns but expected likely standardizes 3-blocks to a mode K, perhaps filling gaps to triples like in train 2's 8's; instead, it keeps scattered 3's with 8's as B). 
 * In rows with 1's (e.g., row 3: 3,8,1,8,8,3), no apparent filling of gaps around 1's, and 2's mid-row (e.g., 2,2 near pos 3-4) remain but may need S-fill if part of gap; expected probably merges 1's into consistent blocks separated by B.
 * 4's and 9's show uneven treatment: row 5 has 4,8,4,4 but scattered; 9's in later rows (e.g., row 5: 9,9) partially filled but not to mode (test has many 9,8,9,8 patterns unchanged, suggesting K=1 mode not triggering fills, but likely K=2 or more from context). 
 * Overall, output retains too much original irregularity (e.g., vertical columns don't align to consistent block patterns as in expected train 2), with 2's inside possibly unfilled gaps; it makes sense as a partial application but not correct, missing proportional gap fills and full standardization per S (e.g., 3's should likely be triples like train 2's 3's/8's). 
 * To handle test, need better multi-S interaction (e.g., 4's seem like another S, but program treats as possible S only if not B/2— in test B=8, so 4 is S but underfilled) and wider grid edge cases (width=29, more room for complex gaps).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based floor plan with walls (likely value 8), floors (likely value 3), and enclosed rooms containing tile patterns that are partially corrupted or inconsistent; the goal is to detect rooms and correct their internal patterns to a consistent repeating motif of a dominant color (C) in groups of size K followed by a single wall tile (W), using the minimal-difference phase-shifted periodic pattern that best fits the existing tiles.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are detected by finding columns with value W (8) in the floor row (row 1), assuming vertical symmetry and consistent wall positions across the grid height.
 * Rooms are segments between consecutive wall columns, excluding leading/trailing floor tiles (F=3) to focus on the "pattern segment"; borders (rows 0, h-2, h-1) and floor (row 1) are skipped to avoid modifying structural elements.
 * A room is only processed if its pattern segment uses exactly one non-W/non-F color (C); multiple colors cause skipping, which misses corrupted rooms needing unification.
 * Group sizes of consecutive C tiles in the segment are computed; the most frequent size K is used to define the period p = K + 1 (K C's + 1 W), and phase shifts (s from 0 to p-1) are tested to find the repeating pattern minimizing mismatches (diffs) with the current row.
 * Correction is applied only if it improves the row (min_diff > 0), but the code requires the expected first tile to match the actual first tile in the segment for a phase to be considered, which may overly restrict valid fits.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a room share the same pattern logic independently (no vertical alignment or multi-row consistency enforced), and patterns are horizontal-only per row.
 * Easy to miss: Floor row (row 1) has mixed F and W, used solely for wall detection; top/bottom borders are all W; rooms may have initial F padding; if no groups of C or multiple K frequencies, no correction happens.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns must repeat with exact period, but code allows only the most frequent K (or ties), potentially missing blended or evolving patterns; no handling for vertical propagation or room-wide color dominance beyond single-color check; assumes grid is non-empty and rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Core logic for wall detection (helpful for identifying room boundaries consistently)
def detect_walls(grid: List[List[int]], floor_row: int = 1, w_val: int = 8) -> List[int]:

    return sorted([j for j in range(w) if grid[floor_row][j] == w_val])
```

    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_pattern = None
    first_val = row_segment[0]
    for s in range(p):
        exp_first_pos = s % p
        exp_first = c_val if exp_first_pos < k else w_val
        if exp_first != first_val:
            continue
        this_diff = 0
        this_pattern = []
        for ii in range(l):
            pos = (ii + s) % p
            exp = c_val if pos < k else w_val
            if exp != row_segment[ii]:
                this_diff += 1
            this_pattern.append(exp)
        if this_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = this_diff
            best_pattern = this_pattern
    return min_diff, best_pattern
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous program correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 by identifying single-color rooms, computing dominant K, and applying phase-shifted corrections where diffs > 0, resulting in uniform repeating patterns.
 * Worked well for rooms with exactly one C and clear group frequencies, enforcing periodicity without over-modifying borders or floors.
 * Did not work for test input: Skipped rooms with multiple colors (e.g., mixes of 1, 2, 4, 9 alongside potential C), leaving uncorrected inconsistencies like scattered 1s, 4s, and irregular 2/9 placements.
 * Phase restriction (matching first tile) may have blocked valid patterns in test rows with offset starts or leading non-C tiles.
 * No vertical consistency check, so horizontal fixes per row don't align rooms across heights, potentially missing global puzzle symmetry.
 * Counter for group sizes is helpful but only uses most frequent K; ties in frequency are handled by trying all, but blended rooms (multiple K) are ignored.
 * Wall detection from floor row is essential and correct, but assumes all walls align perfectly vertically, which holds in training but may not in more complex tests.
 * Single-color check (len(room_colors) != 1) is too strict for initialization/mixed states; training likely had pre-unified colors, but test has artifacts (1,2,4,9) needing merging to a dominant C.
 * No extraction of full objects/rooms as multi-row entities; per-row processing misses subtle vertical patterns or shared corrections.
 * The full program function is mostly helpful but broken for multi-color rooms (skips entirely) and not relevant for vertical or color-unification steps (don't reuse without fixes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to be the input grid with minimal or no changes, as rooms still contain multiple inconsistent colors (e.g., 1s and 4s in what should be unified patterns, 2s and 9s in irregular groups) instead of enforced repeating C-W motifs.
 * Specific differences: In rows like the third (index 2), output has [..., 3, 1, 8, 1, 8, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 3, ...] with scattered 1s and partial 4s, but expected would be uniform groups of a single C (e.g., all 4s in K=4 runs separated by 8s) across the room segment; similar issues in rows 4-28 with 9s misplaced (e.g., [..., 9, 9, 8, ...] vs. expected periodic 9-8 without breaks).
 * Patterns are not periodic: Group sizes vary (e.g., two 2s together, then singles), and no corrections applied, suggesting the single-color filter failed entirely for test rooms, leaving "corrupted" tiles intact.
 * Borders and floors remain unchanged (all 8s top/bottom, 3s with 8s in row 1), which is correct, but internal rooms show no improvement, unlike training where full uniformity was achieved.
 * Overall, output lacks the clean, repeating structure expected (e.g., no consistent K=3 or K=4 C blocks per room); it looks like raw input, indicating the program didn't engage correction logic for the test's complexity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colors or patterns, where the goal is to detect and complete periodic patterns in eligible rows (those bordered by a consistent "background" color s, typically 8), using predefined periods for specific inner colors while preserving or enforcing repeating motifs like sequences of the inner color followed by the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8); otherwise, skip the row entirely.
 * If the cells immediately adjacent to the borders (positions 1 and w-2) match each other and differ from s, treat them as "side" colors and narrow the pattern detection range (istart=2, iend=w-3); otherwise, use the full inner range (istart=1, iend=w-2).
 * Within the inner range, collect unique colors excluding s and any side color; the row is eligible only if exactly one such color c exists (and c != 2, as 2 is skipped entirely).
 * Use a fixed period dictionary for c: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}; default to 2 if undefined. The pattern is then [c] * (period - 1) + [s], repeated cyclically.
 * For eligible rows, test all possible phases (0 to period-1) by counting matches against the current row content in the inner range; select the phase with the maximum matches and overwrite the inner range with that phased pattern.
 * Empty or invalid grids return unchanged; copy the grid to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtle edge case: If istart > iend after side adjustment, skip the row (e.g., very narrow rows).
 * The puzzle emphasizes horizontal row-wise processing only; no vertical or grid-wide interactions are handled.
 * Anomalous colors like 1 and 2 appear in test inputs but are not filled if they violate single-color eligibility or c==2 skip rule—1 may trigger filling if it's the sole inner color, but 2 never does.
 * Patterns are enforced only where the current content partially matches the best phase, but overwriting happens regardless of match count (as long as eligibility passes), potentially introducing s where other values were.
 * No handling for multi-color inners, vertical patterns, or non-periodic fills; assumes all eligible rows should conform to the exact pattern format.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission detailed; it successfully passed both Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of simpler periodic fills with colors like 3,4,9 in bordered rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear single-inner-color eligibility and partial matches, enforcing patterns like [3,3,8] for c=3 (period 3) or [4,8] for c=4 (period 2).
 * Did not handle or break on training cases, but the phase-matching logic ensured minimal disruption to already-correct segments.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the fixed period_dict is essential and correctly skipped c=2; side-color narrowing prevented overreach in bordered patterns.
 * Core row-eligibility checks (borders == s, single c) were robust for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially applied fills: for example, rows with c=3 show enforced [3,3,8] repeats in inner sections (e.g., row 1 has repeating 3,3,8 blocks separated by 8s), and similar for c=4 with [4,8] patterns in places like positions 16-19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: persistent 1s (e.g., row 2 position 9: 1; row 3 position 10:1) suggest rows containing 1 were detected but not filled, possibly because 1 co-occurs with other colors (e.g., 8 or 3) violating len(colors)==1, or period=2 for 1 was applied but mismatched borders/sides—unknown why exactly, but 1s remain unfilled unlike training expectations.
 * 2s are correctly untouched (e.g., row 3 positions 3-4: 2,2), per the c==2 skip, but this leaves "gaps" that may need separate handling if 2 indicates a different pattern type.
 * Some rows show incomplete or shifted patterns (e.g., row 4 has 2,2 then 8,3 but later 1 unfilled; row 12 has extra 1 at position 10), differing from expected uniform periodic completion—likely due to multi-color inners or side mismatches preventing eligibility.
 * Border rows (all 8s) and some inner rows (repeating 3s) are correctly unchanged or filled solidly, but the overall grid still has anomalies like isolated 1s and 9s in non-periodic spots (e.g., row 4 positions 24-25:9,9), indicating the program handles simple cases but misses complex rows with mixed 1/4/9 eligibility.
 * The output makes partial sense for pattern enforcement but not complete, as unfilled 1s and uneven 4/9 blocks (e.g., row 4: four 4s instead of strict [4,8] repeat) suggest phase selection or color detection failed subtly for the test's denser layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a pixel art or pattern completion task) where the goal is to detect and extend periodic or repeating patterns within the inner sections of each row, while preserving border elements (e.g., columns 0, 1, -2, -1 as fixed values like 8s). The program analyzes row data to infer short repeating motifs and fills incomplete or noisy inner sections accordingly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders (first two and last two columns) must remain unchanged, as they appear to frame the puzzle and are consistently 8s in the provided output; the inner fill (from column 2 to cols-3) is where pattern detection and application occur.
 * Patterns are row-specific but may imply global structure (e.g., vertical repetition or symmetry across rows); the code treats rows independently, which works for simple cases but may miss inter-row dependencies like aligned motifs or overall image formation.
 * Period detection relies on maximizing positional matches (inner[i] == inner[i+p]), favoring short periods (1 to n//2 +1); this can overfit to noise if the true period is longer or if the row has mixed values (e.g., 2s, 3s, 8s).
 * Pattern extraction uses majority vote (Counter.most_common) per residue class modulo p, which smooths out outliers but could erase intentional variations (e.g., if 2s are deliberate features rather than noise).
 * Edge cases: Empty inner sections skip processing; very short rows (end < start) are skipped; assumes all rows have equal length and grid is rectangular.
 * Subtle elements: The puzzle may involve not just periodicity but also value-specific rules (e.g., 8 as background, 3 as filler, 2 as accent); over-application of patterns can homogenize diverse rows, losing subtle asymmetries or transitions.
 * Global considerations: Outputs suggest a framed image with horizontal stripes or waves; vertical alignment (e.g., 2s appearing in columns 4,11,18,25 across specific rows) hints at column-wise patterns that row-only processing ignores.
 * All attempts (this is the primary one provided) focus on horizontal periodicity; no vertical or 2D pattern detection, which may be key for complex tests.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_best_period(inner: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(inner)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    best_p = 1
    best_score = 0
    for p in range(1, n // 2 + 2):
        score = sum(1 for i in range(n - p) if inner[i] == inner[i + p])
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_p = p
    return best_p
```
(This function identifies the optimal period by scoring positional matches; useful for detecting repeats but may prefer p=1 for uniform rows, leading to over-smoothing.)

```python
def get_pattern(inner: List[int], p: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(inner)
    pattern = [0] * p
    for r in range(p):
        pos_values = [inner[j] for j in range(r, n, p)]
        if pos_values:
            count = Counter(pos_values)
            most_common = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
            pattern[r] = most_common
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a repeating motif via majority per modulo position; helpful for cleaning noisy data but assumes one dominant value per slot, ignoring minorities like rare 2s.)

```python
def apply_pattern_to_row(out_row: List[int], start: int, end: int, pattern: List[int], p: int):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        idx = j - start
        out_row[j] = pattern[idx % p]
```
(This tiles the pattern across the inner row; straightforward but rigid—doesn't blend with existing border or handle partial fits.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(rows):
        start = 2
        end = cols - 3
        if end < start:
            continue
        inner = [g[r][c] for c in range(start, end + 1)]
        p = find_best_period(inner)
        pattern = get_pattern(inner, p)
        apply_pattern_to_row(out[r], start, end, pattern, p)
    return out
```
(The main driver; processes rows independently with fixed borders—core to the approach but lacks 2D awareness.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating it correctly detects and applies simple horizontal periods in basic cases, likely uniform or short-repeat rows.
 * Worked well for rows with clear repeats (e.g., long stretches of 3s or 8s), as majority voting preserves dominant values while filling gaps.
 * Did not handle test complexity: Introduced or preserved 2s in specific inner positions (e.g., columns 4,11,18,25 in rows 4,16,24—0-indexed), which may be incorrect if 2s are noise to be smoothed or if they should align vertically into a motif (e.g., dots or lines); unknown if input had 2s or if pattern extraction erroneously selected them as majorities in some residue classes.
 * Over-relied on short periods (e.g., p=1 leads to uniform fills like all-3s or all-8s rows), causing repetitive row types in output (e.g., many identical [8,3,8,8,8,...] patterns) that ignore potential longer cycles or row variations.
 * No extraction of global objects (e.g., no functions to detect vertical lines, shapes, or 2D periods); row-only focus misses if puzzle requires completing an image like a symmetric emblem or tiled design.
 * find_best_period is helpful but broken for non-periodic rows (defaults to p=1, filling everything with the global majority like 8 or 3).
 * get_pattern is useful for denoising but not helpful for preserving rare values (e.g., discards 2s if outnumbered, potentially erasing accents).
 * apply_pattern_to_row is functional but unhelpful for blending (forces full overwrite, which may clash if input has partial patterns).
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of horizontal periodicity and borders but lacks depth for vertical/global structure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it produces a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with consistent 8 borders on all sides, inner fills mostly alternating 3s and 8s in short bursts (e.g., "8,3,8,8,8" repeats), and sporadic 2s in rows 4,16,24 at columns 4,11,18,25, suggesting the code detected a period incorporating 2s as a sub-motif rather than smoothing them out.
 * Expected output likely has more structured vertical alignment (e.g., 2s forming columns or a shape like a cross/logo, given their regular spacing every 7 columns), but the generated version treats them row-locally, resulting in isolated 2s without global coherence—different from expectation as it homogenizes many rows to near-identical patterns (e.g., rows 2,6,10,14,... all match [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,...]), losing potential variety or symmetry.
 * Top/bottom rows are all 8s (preserved correctly), second/second-last are bordered 3s (likely from p=1 majority), but inner rows show over-repetition (e.g., 12+ similar "wavy" 3/8 rows), which doesn't form a cohesive image—possibly the puzzle expects a filled emblem or flag where 2s/3s create contours, not scattered.
 * 2s appear only in three rows and specific positions, differing from expectation if they should be expanded vertically or removed as outliers; unknown if input had these 2s, but output preserves/amplifies them incorrectly via majority in local residues.
 * Overall, output makes partial sense for a bordered, horizontally periodic fill but looks incorrect for a visual puzzle, as it resembles noisy stripes rather than a clean, intentional design—core issue is lack of 2D processing, leading to misaligned features.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels or cells, where the goal is to process each row to detect a background color, identify eligible rows with side framing, determine a dominant inner color, infer a periodic pattern from spacing of background elements, and apply the best-fitting pattern to complete or regularize the row while preserving special markers like 2s. The program attempts to automate this by filling non-2 cells in the inner section with a repeating pattern of the dominant color interrupted by background, but leaves 2s untouched.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (s) is detected from the top-left cell and assumed uniform; all processing revolves around rows starting and ending with s.
 * Eligible rows must have length >1 and frame with s on both ends; inner processing skips the first/last cell(s), adjusting further if "side twos" (2s at positions 1 and -2, distinct from s) are present, which act as barriers or exclusions, narrowing the inner range to 2 to w-3.
 * Dominant color (c) is extracted from inner cells, ignoring s and 2s; it must appear in >50% of non-ignored inner cells and be one of {1,3,4,8,9} (note 8 can be both background and dominant, but contextually s=8 in test).
 * Period is derived from positions of s within the inner range: compute differences between consecutive s positions, take the most frequent diff(s), and use the maximum such candidate as period; if <2 s positions, default to full inner length +1.
 * Pattern construction is a run of (period-1) c's followed by one s, intended to create repeating blocks like [c, c, ..., s]; best phase is found by trying all shifts and counting matches on existing non-2 cells (ignoring 2s in matching).
 * Application overwrites all non-2 inner cells with the phased pattern, enforcing regularity but skipping 2s entirely, which may leave gaps if 2s are meant to be filled or if they disrupt the pattern.
 * Subtlety: 2s are treated as "don't touch" or obstacles (skipped in counting, matching, and filling), potentially indicating unknowns, walls, or preserved elements; this could miss cases where 2s need integration into the period or removal.
 * All-8 (or all-s) rows are left unchanged if not eligible or no dominant c found; the program copies the entire grid initially, only modifying eligible rows.
 * Potential edge cases: short rows (istart > iend skips), no inner vals for dominant (returns -1, skips), or uniform inner without s spacing (defaults to long period, leading to solid c fill).
 * Repetition in test grid suggests vertical symmetry or tiled patterns (e.g., repeating row blocks), which the row-wise approach handles but may not capture column-wise interactions.
 * The specific allowed dominants {1,3,4,8,9} imply puzzle constraints on valid colors; test uses 3 as dominant with s=8.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes row-independent processing but with global background; subtle miss: period from s positions assumes s acts as separators, but if s is sparse, period may overestimate, leading to over-long c runs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies uniform background s from top-left, essential for all row checks.)

```python
def is_eligible_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 1 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Simple framing check; key for targeting only bordered rows.)

```python
def has_side_two(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) > 2 and row[1] == 2 and row[-2] == 2 and 2 != s
```
(Detects 2s as side barriers, adjusting inner range; crucial for test rows with initial 2s.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    total = len(vals)
    if count / total > 0.5 and most in {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Extracts majority inner color, ignoring s/2s and validating against allowed set; core for pattern base c=3 in test.)

```python
def get_period(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int, c: int) -> int:
    s_pos = [j for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] == s]
    inner_len = iend - istart + 1
    if len(s_pos) < 2:
        return inner_len + 1
    diffs = [s_pos[k + 1] - s_pos[k] for k in range(len(s_pos) - 1)]
    counter = Counter(diffs)
    if not counter:
        return inner_len + 1
    max_freq = max(counter.values())
    candidates = [d for d, f in counter.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(candidates)
```
(Infers period from s-separator spacing; helpful but subtle issue—uses max candidate, which may pick longer period over shorter if tied freq, leading to grouped 3s instead of tight alternates.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for j in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[j] == 2:
                continue
            idx = (j - istart + phase) % period
            if row[j] == pattern[idx]:
                matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Fits pattern phase by maximizing matches on existing non-2s; good for aligning to partial inputs, but ignores 2s in scoring, potentially biasing away from filling them.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic row framing, dominant color detection, and simple periodic filling for those cases.
 * What worked: Background detection, eligibility checks, and pattern application correctly regularized rows in training, likely filling partial patterns into full repeats without disrupting 2s.
 * What didn't work: In complex cases with many 2s or varying s densities (as in test), it leaves 2s unfilled, resulting in incomplete rows; period selection via max candidate may create unintended long runs of 3s (e.g., groups of 6 3s) instead of tighter alternations like every-other.
 * Overwrites all non-2 inner cells, which enforces pattern but could erase useful input if phase mismatch is high; no column-wise consistency enforced, missing potential vertical alignments in repeated row blocks.
 * get_pattern assumes s only at end of each period, which fits separator-based puzzles but fails if s appears mid-run in input.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full row segments or vertical features; row-only focus works for training but may miss holistic grid puzzles.
 * apply_pattern skips 2s entirely, which preserves them but doesn't integrate (e.g., treat 2s as wildcards to fill with pattern); this is likely a key miss, as test output remains gappy.
 * No handling for rows without clear majority c or s spacing, defaulting to long periods that fill solids (e.g., all inner 3s), which matched training but over-applies in test's repetitive structures.
 * Function get_inner_start_end is helpful for side-2 adjustment but assumes symmetric 2s; asymmetric cases unhandled.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from row lengths) with heavy repetition: all-8 rows (e.g., rows 0,2,5,8,9,12,14,17,20,21,26,28) left unchanged, suggesting they were ineligible or no dominant c.
 * Rows with patterns like [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (e.g., row 1,27) indicate successful dominant c=3 detection and long-period filling, creating grouped 3s separated by single 8s, which looks like a valid periodic completion (period ~7? matching 6x3 +1x8).
 * Many rows (e.g., 3,6,7,9,10,15,18,19,21,22) have persistent [8,8,3,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,...] structure, where initial 3,2,2,8 is partially filled (3s and 8s overwritten to pattern, but 2s skipped), then repeating 3,8; this makes sense per program logic but leaves gaps—expected output likely fills 2s with pattern (e.g., to 3 or 8) for a clean alternate like 3,8,3,8, as unfilled 2s disrupt visual completeness.
 * Row 13 [8,3,8,2,2,3,8,3,8,...] similar issue: 2s remain after a 3, suggesting side-2 adjustment applied but filling skipped them; differs from expectation of seamless 3-8 stripes.
 * Row 23 [8,8,3,8,3,8,...] has no 2s, filled cleanly to alternate, which looks correct.
 * Row 24 [8,3,8,3,2,3,8,3,8,...] has a single 2 mid-pattern, unfilled—expected to match surrounding 3,8 repeat, but program leaves it, creating a visual anomaly.
 * Overall, output is partially patterned (good 3-8 repeats in many places) but incorrect due to unfilled 2s everywhere they appear (~10 rows), making the grid look incomplete or noisy; no vertical consistency enforced (e.g., 2s align in columns but aren't resolved), and long 3-groups in some rows (e.g., row 1) may overestimate period if input had tighter spacing—does not fully match expected clean, filled periodic rows.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 8 for background, 3 for a foreground color, and possibly 2 for unknowns or fillers), where the goal is to detect and complete linear patterns (e.g., repeating motifs or stripes) in eligible rows based on dominant colors, spacing, and periodicity, while preserving the overall structure like borders or backgrounds. The program processes rows independently to fill in blanks or correct inconsistencies using a periodic pattern derived from observed elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows are eligible only if they start and end with the background color (s, often 8), and have sufficient length (>2); this filters out non-pattern rows like solid backgrounds.
 * Inner range excludes borders but may adjust for special markers (e.g., 2's near edges if not background), avoiding over-inclusion of edge artifacts.
 * Dominant color (c, e.g., 3) must appear in >50% of non-background/non-2 inner cells and be from a valid set {1,3,4,8,9}; this ensures it's a meaningful pattern color, not noise.
 * Period is derived from the most frequent spacing (diffs) between background color positions in the inner range; if sparse, it defaults to inner length +1, which can lead to trivial or full fills.
 * Pattern is a simple repeat: (period-1) of dominant color followed by background, phased to best match existing non-2 cells (threshold >=60% match rate on non-2 cells to apply full fill).
 * Filling is conservative: only overwrite 2's or mismatches (non-s, non-c), but can apply globally if threshold met; this risks overfilling if period detection is off.
 * Global background is top-left cell, assuming uniform; grids may have vertical/horizontal symmetry or repeating motifs across rows, but processing is row-wise, missing inter-row dependencies.
 * Subtle: 2's act as wildcards but are skipped in dominance/period calc; if all inner is 2's or background, no fill (c=-1). Periods from few points can be unreliable (e.g., max diff as fallback).
 * Edge cases: Short rows, no inner range (istart > iend), or low match rate skip processing; valid colors exclude outliers like 2 or invalid nums.
 * Puzzle likely involves thematic elements (e.g., waves, bars, or objects with holes/stripes), so patterns should align visually across rows for coherence, not just per-row.

```
(Note: The full `program` function orchestrates these; `compute_matches` is a helper but inlineable. No types like classes needed yet, as row-wise processing suffices. No object extraction function present, as puzzle seems pattern-based, not object-detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating core row eligibility, dominant color detection, and periodic filling work for simple repeating patterns (e.g., uniform stripes or basic motifs).
 * For the test input, the program generated a filled grid with mostly 8 (background) and 3 (dominant), applying periodic fills in eligible rows, but it over-applied in complex rows: e.g., row 2 becomes uniform groups of six 3's separated by single 8's, which matches a detected period but ignores sparse/irregular 3 placements in the input (assuming input had 2's or mismatches).
 * What worked: Background detection (s=8), inner range calc, dominant color (3) reliably picked, period from s-positions leading to plausible repeats in straight rows (e.g., row 1 and 14/27/28 all-8 preserved).
 * What didn't: Period detection favors max diff in ties, leading to large periods (e.g., full inner length) and uniform fills where input had varying densities (e.g., row 3 output has isolated 3's at positions like 1,6,13,... but input likely had clustered or asymmetric patterns, causing mismatches); match threshold (60%) triggered too often, filling 2's and some non-c cells, potentially smoothing out subtle variations like diagonals or waves across rows.
 * No inter-row consistency enforced, so vertical alignments (e.g., 3's stacking into shapes) may break; e.g., rows 3-5 output shows staggered 3's that might not form coherent objects.
 * Function `get_period` is helpful but subtle issue: with few s_pos, it defaults high, causing broad patterns; could miss short repeats if diffs vary.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions here—all are relevant, but `get_inner_range` adjustment for 2's may skip too much if edges have patterns; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed if puzzle involves bounded shapes rather than open rows.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it produces a grid with heavy periodic filling of 3's in horizontal groups (e.g., row 2: repeating [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] blocks, row 3: sparser [3,8,8,8,8,3,8] with 3's every ~6-7 positions), which aligns with the program's logic but appears too uniform and row-independent compared to what a visual puzzle might expect (e.g., connected vertical structures or asymmetric motifs like letters/shapes).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle requires preserving input irregularities for thematic elements (e.g., if input had 2's outlining waves or bars, output should complete to match across rows, not force identical periods); here, rows like 4 and 7 have clustered 3's (e.g., [3,8,8,3,8,3,8,...]) that don't vertically align well (e.g., 3 in col 1 of row 4 doesn't match row 3's col 1=3 but shifts in row 5), suggesting over-smoothing; bottom rows (25-28) mirror top but with artifacts like extra 3's in row 25, indicating period misdetection on denser inputs.
 * It makes partial sense for stripe-like patterns (e.g., row 14 all-8 correct as ineligible), but fails on subtlety: no handling for varying periods per row or global motifs, leading to a "striped wallpaper" effect instead of structured objects; unknown why row 13 has irregular [3,8,3,3,8,3,...]—likely tie in diff counter picking max, but expected might be min or average for tighter fits.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where certain rows are "bordered" with a background color, and the task is to complete or extend incomplete repeating patterns inside those bordered regions based on a dominant inner color, using rules for pattern periodicity and phasing to fill in unknowns (likely represented by 2s or gaps).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Rows must be explicitly bordered: they start and end with the background color s (e.g., 8), and have sufficient width (at least 2-3 cells) to qualify for pattern filling; non-bordered rows are skipped entirely.
 * Background color s is determined from the top-left cell, assuming a uniform background; this works if the grid is consistent but could fail if backgrounds vary.
 * Inner range extraction skips borders and any adjacent "unknown" markers (like 2s next to borders), but assumes 2s are only at edges—subtle issue if 2s appear elsewhere in the pattern.
 * Dominant color c is the most common non-background, non-unknown value in the inner range, but only if it exceeds 50% frequency; otherwise, skip the row to avoid false positives.
 * Patterns are color-specific: for c=3, period=3 with pattern [3,3,s]; this is a repeating motif of (period-1) instances of c followed by s, but phasing is needed to align with existing cells for best fit.
 * Phasing searches for the shift that maximizes matches with existing non-unknown cells, but the matching logic only counts exact matches and ignores unknowns (2s), which could lead to suboptimal fills if the grid has many unknowns.
 * Application overwrites the entire inner range with the phased pattern, including existing cells—this assumes the input is mostly incomplete and patterns are strict, but could destroy partial correct fills if phasing is wrong.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical alignment or inter-row dependencies are considered, which might miss puzzles where patterns span columns across rows.
 * Subtle edge cases: narrow rows (<3 cells) default to empty inner range; all-unknown inners return -1 for dominant color; periods are hardcoded per color (e.g., 3 for c=3, 4 for c=8), suggesting color-specific rules that might not generalize to new colors.
 * Unknowns (2s) are treated as wildcards during phasing but get overwritten; if 2s represent something else (e.g., barriers), this could be incorrect.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes periodicity and majority-rule filling, but skips conservative (e.g., only fill unknowns) to aggressively complete rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(Extracts uniform background color from top-left; simple and reliable if grid is consistent.)

```python
def is_bordered_row(row: List[int], s: int) -> bool:
    return len(row) >= 2 and row[0] == s and row[-1] == s
```
(Checks for bordered rows; essential for identifying candidates, but misses partial borders.)

```python
def get_inner_range(row: List[int], s: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    w = len(row)
    if w < 3:
        return 1, 0
    if row[1] == 2 and row[w - 2] == 2:
        return 2, w - 3
    return 1, w - 2
```
(Defines the fillable inner section, skipping borders and adjacent 2s; helpful for isolating patterns but assumes 2s only at inner edges—could be broken if 2s are mid-pattern.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    counter = Counter(vals)
    most, count = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    if count / len(vals) > 0.5:
        return most
    return -1
```
(Core for identifying the pattern color c; strict majority threshold is a good subtlety to avoid noise, using collections.Counter.)

```python
def get_period(c: int) -> int:
    period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2}
    return period_dict.get(c, 2)
```
(Hardcoded periods per color; useful if colors have fixed rules, but unhelpful for unseen colors—defaults to 2, which may not generalize.)

```python
def get_pattern(c: int, period: int, s: int) -> List[int]:
    return [c] * (period - 1) + [s]
```
(Generates the repeating unit; key for c=3 as [3,3,8], but assumes pattern always ends with s—subtle if some patterns don't.)

```python
def find_best_phase(row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int) -> int:
    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(period):
        matches = 0
        for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
            if row[jj] != 2:
                idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
                if row[jj] == pattern[idx]:
                    matches += 1
        if matches > best_matches:
            best_matches = matches
            best_phase = phase
    return best_phase
```
(Brute-forces phase alignment by maximizing matches on non-2 cells; helpful for fitting patterns but computationally simple—ignores length mismatches and could favor wrong phases if input is sparse.)

```python
def apply_pattern(grid_row: List[int], istart: int, iend: int, pattern: List[int], period: int, phase: int) -> None:
    for jj in range(istart, iend + 1):
        idx = (jj - istart + phase) % period
        grid_row[jj] = pattern[idx]
```
(Overwrites inner range with phased pattern; direct but aggressive—unhelpful if partial input should be preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, so no multi-attempt history; it succeeded on both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of simpler bordered rows with dominant colors like 1,4, or 9 where periods and patterns matched expectations.
 * Worked well for: bordered row detection, dominant color extraction via majority, and phased pattern application in cases where unknowns (2s) were edge-adjacent and input density allowed >50% match for c.
 * Did not work for test: the program applied patterns but produced inconsistent fills (e.g., rows like [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] instead of a clean repeat of [3,3,8] phased correctly), suggesting phasing or inner range logic fails on longer/sparser rows; top/bottom all-8 rows were preserved correctly (as non-bordered), but middle rows overwrote incorrectly, leaving a jagged pattern that doesn't tile smoothly.
 * get_inner_range may be broken for test: it skips only adjacent 2s, but if test input has no 2s (output shows filled 3s and 8s, implying input was partial), it uses 1 to w-2, leading to overreach into borders or misalignment.
 * find_best_phase counts matches but doesn't penalize conflicts (e.g., if existing 8s inside clash with [3,3,8]), causing suboptimal phase selection—unknown why it chose phases yielding 8,3,8 starts instead of 3,3,8.
 * get_dominant_color worked (chose 3), but >0.5 threshold might be too strict for sparse test inputs; pattern for c=3 (period 3) is correct in concept but phasing failed to align globally.
 * No object extraction functions were used or needed; this attempt focuses on row-level patterns, not blob/object detection—unhelpful for this puzzle, as it seems row-centric without multi-row objects.
 * Overall, training success shows core bordered-pattern filling is understood, but test reveals gaps in handling long rows, phase conflicts, or input without 2s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a grid with top/bottom rows fully 8 (correct, as non-bordered), but middle rows show an inconsistent repeating motif starting with 8,3,8,3,3 (e.g., second row: [8,3,3,8,3,3,...] which partially matches [3,3,8] but shifted wrong; most rows: [8,3,8,3,3,8,...] which inserts extra 8s and doesn't tile [3,3,8] cleanly across the width of ~29 cells).
 * Expected: For dominant c=3 (background s=8), inner should fill with phased [3,3,8] repeating to match existing partials, likely yielding uniform rows like [8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...8] (phase 1) or [8,8,3,3,8,3,3,...] (phase 2), but output has erratic 8 placements (e.g., single 3s between 8s), suggesting phase selection favored local matches over global periodicity—mismatches observed effects like isolated 3,8,3,3 groups instead of consistent triples.
 * Second-last row mirrors second row correctly (symmetry?), but this seems coincidental; overall, the output looks like a failed tiling (length 29 not multiple of 3=28+1, so should end with partial [3] or [8], but instead ends jagged with 3,8).
 * Does not make sense: if input had partial 3s, output should complete to >50% 3s in groups, but generated has roughly alternating 3s/8s with clumps, implying the majority threshold passed but phasing broke the repeat—unknown if input lacked 2s (causing full overwrite) or had them mid-row (ignored wrongly).
 * To handle test: Adjust phasing to maximize density of c (not just matches), extend inner range conservatively, or add conflict penalties; account for grid width not divisible by period (e.g., truncate pattern).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to complete or "fix" partial patterns in a 2D grid (using numbers like 1-4 and 9 as pattern elements) within bounded sections defined by vertical "walls" (full columns of floor value 8), while preserving the floor (8) borders and structure. The program processes inner rows and subsections between walls to identify dominant pattern elements and fit periodic repeating motifs (groups of the dominant element interrupted by floor) that best match the existing partial data, effectively inpainting or regularizing incomplete patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the floor value (f, typically 8), excluding the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) borders which are always treated as implicit walls; only process subsections starting 2 cells inward from each wall to avoid border interference.
 * Only process inner rows (from row 1 to h-2), leaving top and bottom rows untouched as they are typically full floor.
 * In each subsection of a row, ignore pure floor; identify the most common non-floor value c from a restricted set {1,2,3,4,9} (8 is floor, others like 0 or 5-7 might be invalid or ignored).
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the subsection (skipping floor gaps), then select the maximum group length g_val that appears with the highest frequency (ties broken by taking the largest g_val).
 * Fit a periodic pattern with period u = g_val + 1, consisting of g_val consecutive c's followed by one f (floor), testing all possible shifts (0 to u-1); choose the best fit by minimizing total mismatches (distance) with the existing subsection, then maximizing the number of existing c's preserved, then minimizing shift value for ties.
 * Subsections must have at least 1 cell after trimming; if no valid c or groups, skip (leave unchanged).
 * Subtlety: This approach assumes each subsection is dominated by a single c and fits a simple periodic "run of c's interrupted by floor" motif, which works for uniform patterns but may overwrite or poorly handle mixed multi-color sections (e.g., coexisting 1,2,4 in one subsection) by forcing a single c-dominant fit.
 * Easy to miss: Counter only counts non-floor in subsection; groups are only of consecutive c's (ignoring interspersed floor or other values as separators); fitting preserves some original c's but can replace other values (e.g., 1's or 2's) with the dominant c or floor, potentially disrupting non-dominant patterns.
 * The grid is copied and modified in-place per row/section, so order matters (top-to-bottom processing); no inter-row consistency enforced, allowing vertical misalignment.
 * Allowed set {1,2,3,4,8,9} includes 8 (floor) but code filters it out in counter; 9 might be a special "variant" of patterns like inverted or colored versions.
 * If subsection is empty or all floor after trimming, skip; best fit only applied if a pattern is generated (n>0).

(This identifies vertical wall columns correctly, essential for sectioning; works well as it scans full height.)

            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts consecutive runs of a specific c, ignoring floor/other as gaps; key for identifying periodic motifs, but only handles one c per call—call multiple times if needed for multi-color checks.)

            pattern[ii] = c if pos < g_val else f
        dist = sum(pattern[kk] != subinner[kk] for kk in range(n))
        preserved = sum(1 for kk in range(n) if subinner[kk] == c and pattern[kk] == c)
        update = False

            best_shift = shift
            best_pattern = pattern[:]
    return best_pattern
```
(This generates and selects the best periodic fit; core to the puzzle logic, with multi-criteria selection handling ties well; returns None if empty, preventing errors.)

The main `program` function orchestrates everything: copies grid, finds walls, loops over rows/sections, computes dominant c and g_val, applies fit if possible. It's helpful as a full pipeline but could be extended for multi-color sections (e.g., by checking if one c dominates >50% before fitting).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely (output matched expected, indicating correct wall detection, single-c dominant fitting, and periodic motif completion for simple cases).
 * Worked well for uniform sections with clear dominant c and group lengths (e.g., partial runs of 3's fitted to repeating 3's with floor interruptions).
 * Did not work fully for the test case: the output shows heavy repetition of similar row patterns (e.g., rows 3-28 cycle through variants with 3's dominant but interspersed 1's, 2's, 4's, 9's not fully integrated or overwritten in places), suggesting the single-c fitting per section disrupts mixed patterns—e.g., sections with coexisting 1/4 might get forced to 3's if 3 is most common, losing original structure.
 * Repetitive lower rows (e.g., rows 25-28 mirror upper patterns but with minor shifts like 2's placement) indicate possible over-reliance on max g_val without vertical consistency, leading to tiled-like artifacts instead of coherent global shapes.
 * Wall finding and subsection trimming (+2/-2) worked (borders remain 8's, sections separated properly), but skipping logic for empty/no-groups sections preserved some originals, which is good but may leave unfilled mixed areas.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct for run-length analysis but assumes one c—could miss if multiple c's have competing max frequencies.
 * fit_pattern is essential and works for periodic completion but may produce suboptimal shifts in noisy/mixed data (e.g., prefers low mismatch but could destroy subtle non-periodic hints).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the Counter for dominant c is simplistic (most_common(1) ignores ties or low-count dominants); consider frequency threshold to avoid fitting weak dominants.
 * Training 1/2 passed likely due to simple single-pattern sections; test mismatches expected holistic shapes (e.g., the 2's and 9's placements look staggered but not forming clean objects, possibly due to independent row processing—unknown if input had vertical alignments that got broken).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: borders are intact (all-8 top/bottom, vertical 8 walls/separators), inner rows show fitted patterns like runs of 3's in horizontal sections (e.g., row 2 has clean 3's groups separated by 8's, matching periodic fit), and mixed elements (1's,2's,4's,9's) appear in "object-like" clusters (e.g., 2's in pairs around columns 3-5, 4's in row 3 cols 16-20, 9's in lower right), suggesting some preservation of input structure while regularizing.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: excessive repetition across rows (e.g., rows 3/5/7/9/11/... alternate similar 3-8-1-8 patterns with minor 2/4/9 insertions, creating a tiled or copied feel rather than organic progression); this differs from expected by likely overwriting mixed-color subsections with dominant 3's (e.g., row 3 has 3's dominating but 1's and 4's partially preserved—expected might integrate them better without forcing periodicity). Vertical incoherence (e.g., 2's in row 4 cols 3-4 don't align perfectly with row 3's empties) suggests row-independent processing broke alignments. 9's appear in sporadic pairs/trios (e.g., row 5 cols 24-25), which might be correct variants but look under-fitted compared to denser 3's. Overall, it regularizes too aggressively for uniform areas but leaves mixed ones semi-resolved, not forming clean "objects" or full patterns—expected output should have more varied, vertically consistent shapes without such repetition.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 8 as background/wall color) divided into vertical chambers by full-wall columns of 8's, where the goal is to complete or correct incomplete patterns inside each chamber using rules based on existing color groups, likely to form consistent periodic or repeating motifs horizontally within rows while respecting the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with the background color s (typically 8 from g[0][0]), separating the grid into independent chambers; only these full columns count as walls, and the program correctly identifies them but assumes they are fixed.
 * Within each chamber (subrow between walls in a row), patterns are completed only if the inner section has exactly one dominant color c (besides background 8 and optional matching side colors); multiple colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9 mixed) block changes, leading to incomplete fills.
 * Group lengths of consecutive c's determine the periodic motif: compute lengths of runs of c, find the most frequent length g_val (maximized if ties), then create a period u = g_val + 1 of (g_val c's followed by one 8); this simulates striped or dashed patterns.
 * Phase selection for the period is critical: try all phases 0 to u-1, score by minimizing total changes (dist to pattern), then maximizing preserved original c's, then minimizing phase number; this favors minimal disruption but can leave artifacts if original data doesn't fit well.
 * Subtleties include handling side colors: if subrow ends match and !=8, treat them as fixed sides and ignore them in color/group analysis (i_start=1, i_end=l-2); otherwise, full subrow is considered, but this can fail if sides are inconsistent vertically.
 * Vertical consistency is ignored (processing is purely per-row, per-chamber), which may be a miss if the puzzle requires 2D alignment across rows; also, no global color propagation or chamber-wide rules.
 * Edge cases: empty/short subrows (<2 cells) skipped; no groups of c means no change; assumes square-ish grid but works on rectangular; s is always g[0][0], assuming uniform background.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to aim for a coherent image (e.g., pixel art with repeating textures in chambers), but the approach risks overfilling simple areas (e.g., all 3's) while underfilling complex ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This identifies wall columns correctly and is essential for chamber segmentation; robust for sparse or dense walls.)

```python
def get_group_lengths(subrow: List[int], c: int, i_start: int, i_end: int) -> List[int]:
    groups = []
    i = i_start
    while i <= i_end:
        if subrow[i] == c:
            length = 1
            i += 1
            while i <= i_end and subrow[i] == c:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            groups.append(length)
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```
(This extracts run lengths of a specific color accurately and is key for determining periodic motif lengths; simple and efficient.)

(The main program's phase-fitting loop is helpful for optimization but complex; the Counter on groups to find max_freq and max(candidates) handles ties by picking largest g_val, which may bias toward longer repeats.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, likely because they featured simple single-color chambers with clear group lengths that fit the periodic rule without multi-color interference.
 * Worked well for identifying walls and applying horizontal periodic fills in uniform areas, producing clean repeating patterns (e.g., runs of 3's separated by 8's in test row 1).
 * Did not handle multi-color chambers effectively, leaving diverse colors (1,2,4,9) unchanged, resulting in fragmented patterns that don't form a cohesive image.
 * Per-row processing ignores vertical patterns, causing misalignment (e.g., 2's appear in irregular positions across rows like 3,4,7,10, etc., without vertical continuity).
 * Phase selection minimizes changes but can preserve errors if original data has noise; for example, in test row 2, areas like positions 9-13 (3,1,8,1,8) remain mixed instead of unifying to a single motif.
 * Side-handling logic (skipping matching ends) works for bordered chambers but fails if sides vary per row, leading to inconsistent i_start/i_end.
 * No extraction of full objects or 2D structures (e.g., no function to detect vertical groups or blobs across rows), which might be needed for complex figures; the program treats each row independently, missing holistic puzzle elements.
 * get_group_lengths is helpful and correct; find_walls is essential and works; the best-phase selection loop is useful but overfits to horizontal runs without considering chamber-wide consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the color set check (len(colors)==1) is too strict—could be relaxed to dominant color if puzzle allows minor variations.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29x29 grid (rows 0-28, columns 0-28) with walls at columns 0,7,14,21,28 (all 8's vertically, correctly preserved), dividing into 4 main chambers of width 6 each (positions 1-6,8-13,15-20,22-27).
 * Simple areas filled correctly, e.g., row 1 has perfect horizontal repeats of six 3's per chamber, matching a g_val=6 period (all c=3, no changes needed); row 27 mirrors this at bottom.
 * Does not look fully correct overall: mixed colors (1 in columns 9/12, 2 in 3/4, 4 in 17-20, 9 in 24-25) persist unchanged in most rows, creating scattered "objects" (e.g., vertical-ish 1's in columns 9/12 across rows 2-28, but with 8's interrupting; similar for 4's and 9's), suggesting incomplete unification—expected might be to extend dominant colors or patterns vertically/2D.
 * Inconsistencies observed: row 25 has anomalous 2's at columns 2 and 4 (3,2,8,2,8,...), differing from nearby rows (e.g., row 24 has 8's there), possibly due to original input noise not fitting single-color rule; row 14 has 4's at 18-19 merged oddly (8,4,4,3? wait, no—[8,3,8,2,2,8,...3,4,8,4,4,3,...]), showing partial fills but breaks in periodicity.
 * Patterns repeat every 6 rows somewhat (e.g., rows 2-7 similar to 8-13, with 2's/1's/4's in fixed column positions), but variations (e.g., row 25's extra 2's, row 5's 9's at 24-25 vs. row 4's 8,9,8) indicate the program didn't enforce vertical alignment, making the output look like a noisy, half-completed pixel art (perhaps meant to be figures like bars or symbols in chambers) rather than polished.
 * Bottom/top borders (rows 0 and 28 all 8's) are correct, but inner chambers lack full coherence—e.g., left chamber has 3's and sporadic 2's, not a uniform texture; if expected is all chambers filled to match a single motif per chamber (e.g., all 3's with vertical stripes), this misses it.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with symbols like borders of 8s and internal patterns of 3s, 1s, etc.) by applying a periodic correction to the non-border sections of each row. The goal is to identify an optimal period p for each row's pattern that minimizes the total cost (number of changes needed to make each residue class uniform via its mode + the period length itself), then replace the pattern with the corrected version using the minimum mode value in case of ties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have fixed borders: rows start and end with 8s, and the pattern section is from index 2 to w-3 (inclusive), assuming w >= 4; if w < 4, no correction is applied.
 * For periodic correction, divide the pattern into residue classes modulo p; for each class, compute the mode (most frequent value), breaking ties by choosing the minimum value; empty classes default to 0 (though unlikely in valid grids).
 * Optimal p is searched from 1 to L//2 (where L is pattern length), selecting the one minimizing (total changes across classes + p); changes for a class are (size of class - max frequency).
 * Subtlety: The cost function balances sparsity (low changes) with simplicity (low p), so small p might overfit noise, while large p might ignore structure; ties in mode selection always take the smallest value, which could affect visual consistency (e.g., preferring 1 over 3).
 * Grids may have repeating row patterns or vertical periodicity, but corrections are applied row-by-row independently; potential miss: assuming uniform borders—test grids show consistent 8 borders but irregular internals.
 * Edge cases: Empty pattern (L=0) returns unchanged row; all-8 rows or uniform patterns should remain unchanged if mode is 8.
 * Visual intent: Likely denoising or completing periodic textures in a puzzle image (e.g., stripes or tiles), where 8 is background/border, 3 is filler, 1/2 are anomalies or features to preserve/correct based on periodicity.
 * No column-wise or global corrections; row independence is key, but test shows vertical repetition (e.g., rows 3-6 identical), suggesting possible grid-wide structure not yet exploited.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples, indicating the core row-wise periodic correction logic (with borders preserved and mode-based replacement) works for simple cases.
 * What worked: Border handling (8s untouched), period search up to L//2, cost minimization (changes + p), and mode selection with min-tiebreaker align with puzzle rules for uniform or simple periodic patterns in training.
 * What didn't work: In complex test grids with mixed values (1s, 2s, 3s amid 8s), the correction over-applies uniformity, e.g., turning irregular patterns into repetitive 8-3-8... without preserving subtle features like isolated 1s or the 2 in row 26, suggesting the cost function or mode tiebreaker might undervalue low-frequency elements.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the current get_min_cost_and_p assumes p <= L//2 strictly—could miss full-period cases (p=L) if L even; also, default to 0 for empty counters is unhelpful if grids are dense (better to propagate nearest mode or skip).
 * Training successes imply extract-like functions aren't needed yet (no object extraction), but future attempts might need vertical analysis if rows interact.
 * Subtle miss: Program doesn't handle if best_p=1 leads to full-mode replacement (all same value), which works for training but flattens test variety (e.g., row 2 becomes all 3s in middle, possibly expected but visually bland).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: borders are correctly preserved as 8s, and many rows (e.g., 1, 28) are all 8s, suggesting uniform patterns detected correctly; row 2's middle all 3s indicates mode detection for p=1 worked for filler patterns.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows 3-6,9,11-15,17-19,21,23-25,27 show repetitive [8,3,8,...8,3,8] with 3s only at positions 1 and -2 in the pattern, implying a detected period (likely p=27 or similar) that sets most classes to 8 but keeps edge 3s— this differs from expected if the puzzle wants full periodicity (e.g., all 8s or alternating 8-3), as it leaves asymmetric 3s that break visual flow.
 * Rows 8,10,16,20 have inserted 1s in a pattern like 8,1,8,3 repeating, which seems like partial correction of anomalies but introduces structure not in input (assuming input had more noise); this might overfit to local frequencies, differing from expected uniform correction.
 * Row 26 introduces a 2 (e.g., [8,3,8,1,2,8,...]), which looks incorrect—likely a mode tie or counter error selecting 2 over 1/3/8; this anomaly doesn't match the puzzle's visual consistency (all other rows use 1,3,8), suggesting the min-tiebreaker or counter init fails on sparse classes, breaking the expected periodic tile look.
 * Overall, test output shows row independence working but insufficient for vertical coherence (e.g., rows 8/10/16/20 repeat a 1-pattern, but row 26 disrupts it with 2); expected output likely has cleaner periodicity across the grid, like all anomaly rows fully 8 or 3, without rogue 2s.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where background (bg) is typically the border value (e.g., 8), and the goal is to identify vertical "walls" (full bg columns) that divide the grid into sections, then complete or correct patterns within those sections by filling inner areas based on side colors, majority non-bg elements, run lengths, and periodic patterns to match an expected visual design.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns that are entirely bg from top to bottom, including the leftmost (0) and rightmost (w-1) edges; only add internal walls if fully bg.
 * Sections between walls must have matching non-bg side colors (sub[0] == sub[-1] != bg) and length >=3 to be processed; otherwise, skip.
 * Inner area (excluding sides) is filled with side color if it contains only bg or side color; otherwise, identify the most common non-bg, non-side color (c).
 * For patterns with c, compute run lengths of consecutive c's in the inner area, find the most frequent run length (k), assume period = k + 1 (alternating c and bg), and select the phase that minimizes changes to match this periodic unit.
 * Subtleties: If no runs of c, fall back to filling with side color; multiple candidates for max_freq take the largest k; the periodic fill overwrites the inner regardless of original content, which may over-simplify complex patterns.
 * Bg is assumed to be g[0][0], but grids may have uniform borders; ensure deep copy of grid to avoid mutating input.
 * Patterns may repeat vertically across rows but can vary slightly (e.g., offsets or interruptions), so processing is row-by-row but should consider vertical consistency implicitly through shared walls.
 * Easy to miss: Short sections (<3 inner length) are skipped; if inner has no non-bg non-side, it's a solid fill; the best_phase selection uses modulo for cycling the unit [c]*k + [bg].
 * Considerations: The approach assumes horizontal periodicity only within sections; vertical alignment across rows isn't enforced, leading to potential desync; numbers like 1,2,4,9 represent distinct "objects" or sub-patterns that may need preservation or completion rather than overwriting.

        if all(g[i][j] == bg for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(walls)
```
(This function correctly identifies wall columns and is essential for sectioning the grid.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Full program body as provided; it handles copying, wall finding, and per-row per-section processing.
    # Useful for overall structure, but the periodic filling logic needs refinement for complex test cases.
```
(The main program integrates wall finding with pattern completion; the run length and phase selection parts are key but may overfit simple cases.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully passed both training examples by correctly identifying walls, filling solid sections with side colors, and applying periodic patterns based on run analysis for repeating motifs.
 * Worked well for training: Handled simple repeating patterns (e.g., alternating colors between walls) by selecting optimal phases, resulting in clean, symmetric fills that matched expected outputs.
 * Did not work for test: The periodic overwrite ignores vertical consistency, leading to desynchronized patterns across rows (e.g., offsets in 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s); also, it treats all non-dominant colors uniformly, potentially erasing distinct sub-objects like isolated 1s or 2-pairs.
 * The fallback to side color fill works for empty inners but is applied too broadly when runs are absent or sparse.
 * Run length analysis assumes max frequent run defines period, which fits training but fails when test has irregular or multi-period patterns (e.g., combined motifs like 2-2 pairs interrupted by bg).
 * No vertical processing: Rows are independent, missing opportunities to propagate patterns downward for coherence.
 * Counter for non-bg non-side is helpful for selecting c, but most_common(1) ignores ties or low counts, which may pick wrong dominant in noisy test sections.
 * Deep copy via [row[:] for row in g] is correct and prevents input mutation.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all components (walls, runs, phase) are relevant but need tuning for subtlety like preserving short runs or multi-color sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies walls (implied by sectioned fills with 3s as sides in many rows) and applies periodic-like fills (e.g., repeating 3-8 or 3-bg patterns), but it does not look fully correct due to inconsistencies across rows.
 * Observed effects: Rows 0 and 28 are all 8s (bg borders, correct); many inner rows show attempted fills like [3,3,3,3,3,3,8] segments, suggesting solid or periodic 3-fills between walls at ~positions 0,7,14,21,28; however, sub-patterns like 1s (e.g., row 2: positions ~9-12: 1,8,1,8) and 2s (row 3: ~3-5: 2,2,8) are partially preserved but desynced (e.g., row 25 has [2,8,2,8] instead of consistent 8,2,2,8 from row 3).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have vertically aligned motifs (e.g., a consistent "ladder" of 1-8-1 across rows in one section, or symmetric 4s and 9s); instead, generated has row-specific variations (e.g., row 4 has 1,8,1,8,3 but row 5 shifts to 8,1,8,1,3; row 25 disrupts with 2,8,2,8 while others have 8,2,2,8), indicating the row-independent processing causes misalignment—likely the periodic phase isn't shared vertically.
 * 9s appear in later sections (e.g., row 4: ~24-26: 9,9,8) but inconsistently (some rows have 9,8,9 vs. 9,9,8), suggesting the run/period logic mismatches when sections have paired or clustered non-dominant colors.
 * Overall, test output is ~70% patterned but fails coherence: It overwrites too aggressively (e.g., row 14 has 4,8,4,4 which blends 4s oddly), erasing subtle interruptions; if expected is a complete, symmetric visual (e.g., shapes like letters or icons), this looks fragmented and incorrect for unknown reasons like phase selection per row instead of global.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background value (likely 8) forms walls and empty spaces, and incomplete regions between walls in each row must be filled with periodic patterns derived from a detected dominant color 'c' in that region, using predefined periods and units that repeat the color interspersed with background. The goal is to complete the grid by applying the best-fitting phase of these patterns to match or preserve existing elements while filling gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns entirely filled with the background value 's' (e.g., 8), excluding the grid edges; they divide the grid into horizontal strips per row for independent processing.
 * Regions between walls are only processed if they contain exactly one non-background color 'c' (ignoring 's'), and 'c' != 2; otherwise, skip to avoid overwriting mixed or special cases.
 * If the colors immediately adjacent to the walls (sides) match and are non-background, treat them as preserved anchors and exclude them from the fillable interior (istart/iend adjusted inward).
 * Periodic patterns use a dictionary for periods: {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}, with unit = [c] * (p-1) + [s]; this creates repeating motifs like [3,3,8] for c=3, p=3.
 * Best phase selection prioritizes maximum matches to the existing row, then maximum preservation of 'c' in positions expecting 'c', with ties broken by lowest phase index.
 * Apply patterns only to the interior (istart to iend); walls and sides remain untouched.
 * Grid is processed row-by-row independently; no vertical consistency enforced across rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns copy; single-cell regions or left > right skipped; multiple colors or c=2 skip (2 may be a special "do not fill" or irregular pattern).
 * Subtlety: The program modifies a copy (new_g) to avoid in-place changes affecting checks; assumes rectangular grid.
 * Potential miss: If a region has no colors (all 's'), it skips, leaving empty; if side colors don't match, full region is considered without preservation.
 * Period dict includes 8 (background), but since c != s, it's unused; may be vestigial.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, applying patterns to single-color regions and preserving sides where applicable.
 * Worked well for simple periodic fills like c=3 with [3,3,8] repeats, as seen in row 2 and 28 of test output.
 * Did not work for mixed-color regions (e.g., containing 1,2,4,9), leaving them mostly unchanged, which may be correct if puzzle rules skip non-uniform areas but results in incomplete test output.
 * Skipped c=2 regions entirely, preserving 2s (e.g., rows 4,7,10 with [2,2] pairs), which seems intentional but may miss if 2 requires a different period (undefined in dict).
 * Wall detection worked, as output shows consistent 8s in wall positions and divisions.
 * Side preservation logic applied in some cases (e.g., symmetric 3s next to walls), but failed or skipped where sides mismatched, leading to full-region attempts that may overwrite incorrectly if colors >1.
 * Phase selection preserved some existing 1s/4s/9s (e.g., row 3 keeps 1s and 4s), but introduced mismatches like scattered 8s in pattern areas.
 * Overall, program understands core filling but may over-skip complex regions; no vertical propagation, which could be a miss if puzzle requires row consistency.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_walls, get_colors, etc.) are relevant and functional, though period_dict lacks entry for 2 (intentional skip).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: Top/bottom rows all 8s (background, correct); rows 2/28 show filled [3,3,3,3,3,3] patterns between 8 walls, matching p=3 unit [3,3,8] but with extra 3s (possibly phase 0 or overfill).
 * Middle rows retain input-like mixtures (e.g., row 3: 1s,4s,3s,8s scattered), suggesting skips for multi-color regions, but this leaves the grid incomplete/unchanged in key areas, unlike uniform training fills—expected more pattern imposition on 1/4/9 zones.
 * Patterns for c=3 appear in segments (e.g., row 3 has 3-8-3 repeats), but 2s (e.g., row 4: [2,2]) and 9s (row 5: [9,8,9]) are preserved without filling, which may be wrong if they need periods (2 undefined, 9 uses p=2: [9,8]).
 * Inconsistencies: Row 25 has [8,8,2,8,...] differing from similar rows (e.g., row 4 [8,2,2,8]), suggesting partial application or input variation, but overall lacks full periodicity (e.g., 1s not converted to [1,8] repeats).
 * Output does not look fully correct: Expected smoother, repeating patterns across all eligible regions (e.g., 1s to [1,8], 4s to [4,8], 9s to [9,8]), but instead mixes originals with partial 8/3 inserts; differs from training success by not transforming diverse colors uniformly—likely skips too aggressively on multi-color or c=2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram, picross, or chamber-filling puzzle) where the input is a partially completed grid of integers representing colors or states (e.g., background B, walls, clues, and blanks marked as 2 or other values), and the goal is to complete it by identifying structural elements like walls and filling chambers with periodic or solid patterns based on dominant values and block modes, while preserving or resolving clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background B (often the top-left value, e.g., 8) represents empty or wall space; walls are full vertical columns of B separating chambers.
 * Blanks are likely marked as 2; "stray" 2s (isolated or in rows without a 2 in position 1) must be converted to B early to avoid false patterns.
 * Chambers are subsections between walls (including left/right edges); sides of chambers may match (same non-B value), in which case inner filling skips the sides; otherwise, include everything.
 * Within a chamber, ignore B and side values to find the most common inner value c (e.g., 3); then compute the mode (most frequent) block length K of consecutive c's.
 * Filling strategy: Prefer a periodic pattern of K c's followed by 1 B (period p = K+1), testing all phases to minimize mismatches; apply only if it improves over a solid fill of c; otherwise, default to solid c.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks of c, skip filling (K=0); handle empty or zero-length chambers; patterns may not apply if no valid inner values; multiple colors (e.g., 1,4,9) in input suggest chambers may have mixed clues that shouldn't all be overwritten by one c—program risks forcing dominant c (like 3) across diverse areas.
 * Easy to miss: Walls must be strictly full B columns (no partials); mode K takes the maximum among ties; filling is row-by-row but chamber-wide, so vertical consistency across rows is crucial but not enforced; input may have pre-filled clues (non-2, non-B) that should guide c but not be blindly overwritten if they mismatch the pattern.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes (h x w), empty grids, and ensure output is a deep copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Considerations from attempts: Periodic filling may fail on irregular clue placements (e.g., scattered 1s/4s/9s), leading to partial overwrites; solid fill fallback might over-simplify complex chambers; no vertical propagation, so row-independent filling can create inconsistent columns.

    max_freq = max(k_count.values())
    cand_k = [k for k, f in k_count.items() if f == max_freq]
    return max(cand_k)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both by properly identifying walls, cleaning 2s, and applying periodic or solid fills in simple chambers.
 * Worked well for uniform or low-variety chambers where a single dominant c (e.g., 3) and clear block modes led to minimal mismatches.
 * Did not handle test input effectively: Over-relied on row[1] for stray 2 detection, which may miss row-specific blanks; chamber filling forced dominant c=3 across diverse areas, leaving clues like 1,4,9 intact instead of resolving them.
 * find_walls is helpful and correct for vertical full-B detection but assumes no partial walls—may miss subtle boundaries in test.
 * get_mode_k is essential for periodic pattern detection but only scans one row per chamber, ignoring vertical consistency; ties in mode are resolved by max K, which may bias toward longer blocks incorrectly.
 * Main program mutates temp_g in-place per row, which works for horizontal patterns but fails to propagate vertically, leading to inconsistent chambers.
 * fill_stray_twos is somewhat helpful for initial cleanup but overly simplistic (relies on row[1]==2 as a flag, which may not generalize); unhelpful in tests with no 2s or scattered blanks.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core wall/chamber logic; however, the phase-testing loop for periodic fill is unhelpful if inner_len is small or clues are dense, as it doesn't penalize clue mismatches enough.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it generates a highly repetitive grid (e.g., rows 2-26 mirror patterns like [8, 3, 8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,...] with minor variations in 4s and 9s), suggesting the program applied the same dominant c=3 and partial periodic fills across most rows without vertical alignment or full resolution.
 * Expected: A coherent completed grid where chambers are uniformly filled (solid or periodic) based on clues, resolving all non-B/2 values into patterns without leftovers; instead, scattered 1s, 4s, and 9s remain (e.g., positions with 1s in columns ~9-12, 4s in ~16-20, 9s in ~24-26), indicating the program skipped filling or mismatched them as non-dominant, leaving "stray" clues unfilled.
 * Repetition across ~25 rows implies per-row processing without cross-row enforcement, creating artificial symmetry not present in a logical puzzle solution; top/bottom rows are solid 8s and 3s, which might be correct for borders, but inner rows should vary more if input had diverse clues.
 * Different from expected: No full overwriting of mixed clues (e.g., 4s and 9s should integrate into c-patterns or be treated as B if mismatched, not left as-is); the output has too many unresolved positions (e.g., row 4 has 9s at end, but row 5 shifts them), suggesting phase selection failed to minimize errors globally—unknown why, but likely due to Counter ignoring vertical context.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense for simple horizontal fills but not for a full puzzle solution, as it appears incomplete and inconsistent vertically; account for multi-color clues and vertical mode computation in future to handle this.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid with background fill (e.g., 8) and partial patterns of other numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,9) separated by "wall" columns that are entirely background, completing the inner sections of non-edge rows with periodic patterns derived from the dominant non-background value's group lengths. The goal is to fit repeating sequences of consecutive dominant values followed by a single background gap, selecting the best alignment (shift) to minimize mismatches while preserving existing dominant values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully filled with the background value f (first grid value, e.g., 8), including edges; inner walls are only those between edges if entirely f.
 * Processing only applies to non-edge rows (i=1 to h-2) to avoid modifying borders.
 * For each section between consecutive walls, extract the sub-row (starting 2 columns in from left wall to 1 column before right wall) and identify the most frequent non-f value c.
 * Compute consecutive group lengths of c in the sub-row, then find the most frequent group length g_val (if ties, take the maximum length).
 * Generate periodic patterns with period u = g_val + 1 (g_val positions as c, 1 as f), testing all shifts (0 to u-1); select the one with minimal Hamming distance (mismatches) to the sub-row, breaking ties by maximizing preserved c's, then minimal shift value.
 * Only apply the pattern if a valid best_pattern is found (i.e., non-empty groups and non_f_counts exist); otherwise, skip.
 * Subtleties: Sections with L <=0 or no non-f values are skipped; patterns may not perfectly match noisy input, leading to partial fills; the approach assumes periodicity but doesn't handle multiple dominant c's per section or non-periodic elements; edge cases like adjacent walls (inner_start >= j2-1) are skipped; the code copies the grid to new_g to avoid modifying during processing.
 * Key: The puzzle likely represents visual objects or waves between barriers, where incomplete sketches need extrapolation to a regular, repeating motif; missing this periodicity assumption leads to over- or under-filling.
 * Considerations: Grid dimensions vary (here ~29x29, but general); f is assumed uniform (g[0][0]); no diagonal or row-wise processing—purely columnar walls and row-wise fills; potential for multiple sections per row if multiple inner walls.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for wall detection, dominant value selection, group length analysis, and periodic fitting works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Accurate wall identification (including edges and full-f columns), sub-row extraction with padding avoidance, Counter-based frequency analysis for c and group sizes, and shift-based pattern optimization with multi-criteria tie-breaking.
 * What didn't work: The approach assumes a single dominant c per section and derives g_val from existing groups, but may fail on noisy or multi-pattern inputs by forcing a global period, leading to suboptimal fills; no handling for sections with mixed values beyond max frequency, potentially ignoring secondary patterns.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, but the full program integrates all steps—future attempts should retain wall-finding and pattern-fitting as modular helpers.
 * Training examples succeeded likely due to clean, single-pattern sections; no specifics on why they passed, but implies the periodicity rule matches expected completions there.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 29-row grid (likely 29x29 based on list lengths) with top/bottom rows all 8s (background preserved), edge columns all 8s, and inner rows showing partial fills of patterns like repeating 3's in wide sections, interspersed with clusters of 1/8, 2/8, 4/8, and 9/8 in narrower sections between apparent walls (e.g., columns 0,8,15,22,28 seem wall-like).
 * It does not look fully correct: Many rows have inconsistent or incomplete patterns, e.g., row 2 has [8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8] where 1's and 4's appear clustered but not periodically extended (e.g., 1's at positions ~9-12 but not repeating with gaps); similar in row 4 with 9's appearing sporadically [...,9,9,8,3,8].
 * Differences from expected: Assuming the puzzle expects clean, fully periodic completions (e.g., uniform waves of 3's with single 8 gaps across wide sections, and tight patterns like 1-8-1 or 4-8-4 in narrow ones), the output retains too much original noise (e.g., isolated 2's in row 3, mismatched 9 placements in row 7) instead of overwriting to fit; row 25 has anomalies like [8,3,2,8,2,8,...] where 2's break expected 8-background or 3-patterns, suggesting failed pattern application or wrong g_val selection.
 * Overall, the output partially makes sense (e.g., wide left section filled with 3-8-3-8-... motifs, preserving some structure) but appears under-corrected, with ~70% of inner cells still noisy/mixed instead of uniform periodic fills; this differs from training success, possibly due to test having multiple inner walls, varying group frequencies, or non-dominant values interfering with c selection—unknown why exactly, but it indicates the fitting criteria (min dist/max preserved) isn't aggressive enough for complex noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) with outer borders and inner frames, where the task is to identify and complete or correct inner row patterns by generating the "best" repeating or tiled pattern that minimizes changes from the existing inner content while prioritizing prefix matches, using the most common non-border/frame color as the primary filler and the outer color as a separator.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent outer border color (e.g., 8) and inner frame colors (e.g., 3 on the sides), with inner sections between frames that may contain incomplete or noisy patterns of other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,9).
 * Inner patterns often appear to be intended as repeating motifs like pairs (e.g., two 4's separated by 8's) or singles (e.g., alternating 4 and 8), but may be corrupted; the solution requires tiling short cyclic units (e.g., [C, C, F] or [C, F]) across the inner length L, choosing the one with fewest mismatches and longest matching prefix to the existing inner row.
 * Only process rows where the second and second-to-last columns match the frame color, and skip if inner length <=0 or no valid inner colors.
 * Exclude outer and frame colors from inner color counting to select C (most common inner color); F is always the outer color.
 * Patterns are generated by cycling short units U of k C's followed by one F (for k=1 to L//2 +1), tiling them to length L, and evaluating across all rotations s of U.
 * Subtlety: The frame color is determined by the most common color in the second column (excluding top/bottom rows), assuming vertical consistency; this may miss horizontal frames or irregular frames.
 * Grids can be large (e.g., 29x29), with repeating row types (e.g., horizontal stripes of patterns like double-2's, single-4's, alternating-9's), so row-by-row processing is key, but vertical alignment/consistency across similar rows should be considered for global coherence.
 * Easy to miss: Prefix matching breaks ties, so patterns that match the start of the inner row are preferred even if total changes are equal; also, if no inner colors, skip the row to avoid overwriting.
 * Considerations from attempts: Vertical patterns (e.g., columns) are not handled, only rows; no global pattern detection across rows; assumes all processable rows use the same C/F, but C can vary per row based on local counts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def get_best_pattern(inner: List[int], C: int, F: int, L: int) -> List[int]:
    best_pattern = inner[:]

    for k in range(1, L // 2 + 2):
        U = [C] * k + [F]
        ulen = len(U)
        if ulen > L:
            continue
        for s in range(ulen):
            cycled = U[s:] + U[:s]
            pattern = cycled * (L // ulen) + cycled[: L % ulen]
            changes = sum(1 for j in range(L) if pattern[j] != inner[j])
            pref = 0
            while pref < L and pattern[pref] == inner[pref]:
                pref += 1
            if changes < min_changes or (changes == min_changes and pref > max_prefix):
                min_changes = changes
                max_prefix = pref
                best_pattern = pattern
    return best_pattern
```
(This function generates and selects the best tiled cyclic pattern for an inner row segment, minimizing changes and maximizing prefix match; core to the solution.)

```python
def find_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    h = len(g)
    if h < 3:
        return g[0][1] if g else 0
    col1_counts = Counter(g[r][1] for r in range(1, h - 1))
    return col1_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This identifies the inner frame color from the most common value in the second column, excluding borders; useful for detecting side frames but assumes vertical consistency and ignores horizontal frames.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2 results were CORRECT, indicating the row-wise pattern tiling with minimal changes and prefix preference works well for simpler or matching cases where inners are mostly uniform or short repeats.
 * The get_best_pattern function successfully handles cyclic tiling of [C]*k + [F] units, correctly skipping invalid lengths and evaluating rotations, which aligned with expected completions in training.
 * find_frame_color correctly identifies frame color (e.g., 3) from column 1 in training, allowing proper inner extraction.
 * What worked: Local per-row processing with color exclusion (outer/frame) and most-common C selection preserves existing structure while filling gaps; tie-breaking via prefix ensures natural extensions.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for vertical patterns or cross-row consistency, which may cause misalignment in grids with stacked similar rows (e.g., repeating double-4 rows); in complex cases, C selection might pick a suboptimal color if multiples are tied.
 * The main program assumes fixed inner_start=2 and inner_len=w-4, which works for consistent 1-cell frames but fails if frames are thicker or irregular.
 * No extraction of full objects or blobs; row-only focus misses potential column-based patterns.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates core understanding of repeating inner motifs separated by outer color, but lacks global grid validation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29-row grid (likely 29x29) with top/bottom all-8 borders intact, side 8's, inner side frames of 3's, and filled inner patterns like repeating [3,3,3,8] in row 1 (but row indices start from 0), [8,4,8,4,...] in row 2 becoming potentially tiled alternates, and similar for doubles like [4,4,8], singles like [2,8], and specials like [9,8] or [1,8].
 * It looks partially correct: borders and frames are preserved, and inners appear to be overwritten with tiled repeats (e.g., row 2 has groups of six 3's separated by 8's, suggesting k=6 with F=8, but input not shown—assuming it minimized changes from noisy input); rows with doubles (e.g., 4,4) seem filled consistently as [4,4,8] repeats.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some rows (e.g., those with 9's or 1's) are filled with [C,8] alternates where C=9 or 1, but if the input had pairs or other motifs, this might over-simplify; vertical misalignment is evident, as stacked rows (e.g., double-4 rows) are filled identically but input may have had vertical stripes—output ignores columns, so horizontal tiling may disrupt vertical patterns (e.g., a column of 4's becomes broken by 8's).
 * Specific differences: Row 8 (0-indexed) has [8,3,8,9,8,9,...] which seems correctly alternated, but row 14 has [8,3,8,1,8,1,...] similarly; however, rows like 4 ([8,3,2,8,2,...] wait no, output shows doubles for 2's in some), wait—output for double-2 rows is [8,3,8,2,2,8,2,2,...] preserved/filled as doubles, good; but the all-3 rows (e.g., row 1) are filled with long [3]*6 +8 repeats, which may not match if input expected uniform 3's without 8 separators— this inserts extra 8's where input had solid 3's, increasing changes unnecessarily (unknown if input had gaps, but seems over-patterned).
 * The output makes sense for horizontal row completion but likely mismatches expected vertical coherence; e.g., a test expecting column stripes (like all 4's in a column) would be broken by row-wise 8 insertions—definitely different from a "perfect" fill that respects both directions.
 * To handle test: Need to add column-wise checks or global pattern detection; current output is better than random but not ideal for multi-direction puzzles.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a bordered image or pattern) where the task is to process each row to detect and repair or complete inner patterns based on border colors, side colors, and dominant repeating sequences within the row's middle section, effectively "fixing" anomalies or incomplete patterns to create consistent periodic fills while preserving borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a consistent border color (e.g., 8) on the outer edges of rows and possibly columns; inner sections start after the first two positions and end before the last two, with side colors (e.g., 3) often placed at positions 1 and n-2.
 * Patterns in the middle (positions 2 to n-3) are analyzed for the most frequent non-border/non-side color (p), and run lengths of that color are used to infer a period (k + 1, where k is the most common run length, or max if ties).
 * Completion involves generating candidate periodic sequences of length m (inner width) that alternate between p and the side/border color (s or b) with the inferred period, selecting the one with minimal differences to the input pattern to "repair" mismatches.
 * Subtleties: If a row is all border color, skip processing; handle small grids (n < 4) by returning unchanged; ties in run length frequencies default to max run; only consider colors != i (side) and != b (border) for p; the sequence wraps with modulo for periodicity, starting at different phases (j in 0 to period-1) to find best fit.
 * Easy to miss: The side color i is taken from g[1][1] if available, else border; patterns may have multiple colors, but only the max count one (p) is used for filling; if no valid color_counts, skip; the fill only targets the middle m positions, leaving borders and sides intact.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution): Focus on row-wise processing (not global/column-wise); minimize changes to input (low diffs); handle varying pattern lengths and colors per row; potential for vertical consistency not enforced, as it's row-independent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the summarized last attempt; no prior ones detailed, but code shows evolution toward row-wise periodic repair using run lengths and min-diff selection.
 * Worked well: Correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 fully (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating grasp of border preservation, side color setting, and basic pattern detection/filling.
 * Did not work: Test output shows over-aggressive filling (e.g., row 2 fills long stretches of 3s in groups of 6 separated by single 8s, but this may not match input anomalies; row 3 introduces 4s in short runs separated by 8s, potentially creating artificial periodicity where input had irregularities).
 * Subtle issue: Reliance on max run length for ties may lead to longer periods than needed; defaulting best_seq to [i]*m if no runs skips filling entirely in edge cases.
 * The run length computation only counts consecutive p's, ignoring other colors' structure, which works for simple repeats but may fail complex multi-color inputs.
 * No extraction functions used (e.g., no object/blob detection); this attempt is purely row-based, which succeeded on training but may miss vertical/cross-row patterns.
 * Function for periodic sequence generation (inner loop) is helpful and core; Counter for runs/colors is essential.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It preserves top/bottom full-8 borders, sets consistent side 3s in most rows, and applies repeating patterns (e.g., groups of 3s in row 2, pairs of 4s/2s/9s separated by 8s in rows 3/5/9/etc., alternating 1-8 in row 15), showing the periodic repair logic is active and creates visually structured inners.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Rows like 3 and 14 have short 4-runs (e.g., [3,4,8,4,4,8,...]) that introduce 8s as separators inside the middle, but this may be over-correcting if the input had longer continuous sections— the output differs from expected by creating more fragmentation (e.g., single 8s breaking runs, potentially not minimizing diffs enough for non-periodic inputs); row 1 (all 8s) and row 28 (all 8s) are unchanged as expected, but inner rows like 15 (1-8 alternates) seem correctly sparse, while others like 4 (longer 4-runs) vary inconsistently without vertical alignment (e.g., row 3 has 4s, but row 4 has more 4s, yet not synced). Overall, the output is more uniform/patterned than raw input might be, but the exact diffs aren't verifiable without input—suspect it's close but misses subtle input-specific repairs, as patterns repeat too rigidly (e.g., exact k=2 for pairs in multiple rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a 2D grid (likely representing a partially filled image or pattern with numeric "colors") by identifying vertical "wall" columns fully occupied by a background value (s, often 8), then filling the spaces between walls in each row with either solid dominant colors or periodic patterns based on predefined periods for specific colors (1,3,4,8,9), while ignoring or skipping certain values like 2 (possibly placeholders or errors) and ensuring majority dominance.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns where EVERY row has the background value s; partial walls (e.g., 8s in some but not all rows) do not qualify and should not be treated as boundaries.
 * Between walls, shrink the fillable region if the immediate side cells (istart and iend) match a non-s, non-2 color, treating them as fixed "frames" to avoid overwriting structural elements.
 * Dominant color detection ignores s and 2 values, requires >50% majority of non-ignored cells, and only considers valid colors {1,3,4,8,9}; if no dominant, skip filling that segment.
 * Patterns are periodic with fixed periods per color (e.g., 1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2), consisting of (p-1) instances of the color followed by one s (background for separation?); choose the phase that maximizes matches to the current row segment.
 * Compare periodic pattern matches to solid fills of the dominant color, applying whichever fits better (higher match count); this handles cases where the row is already mostly solid vs. patterned.
 * 2 values seem to act as "unknown" or "to-be-filled" placeholders that are skipped in analysis but should be overwritten during filling if they fall in the segment—persisting 2s indicate incomplete filling or mismatched segments.
 * Grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) are always treated as implicit walls.
 * Processing is row-by-row and segment-by-segment, modifying a copy of the grid; no vertical or global consistency enforcement across rows, which might miss multi-row patterns.
 * Subtle: Patterns cycle with phase shift, so alignment matters; solid fill can override if it matches more, but this might over-simplify irregular segments.
 * Potential miss: If a segment has mixed valid colors without >50% dominance, it skips, leaving 2s or originals intact—could lead to incomplete grids.
 * Periods are hardcoded and color-specific, implying the puzzle has predefined "textures" (e.g., 3 might be a dotted pattern with period 3).
 * No handling for horizontal walls or 2D connectivity; assumes independent row fills.
 * s is dynamically set from g[0][0], assuming uniform background.

    best_matches = -1
    best_phase = 0
    for phase in range(p):
        matches = sum(1 for j in range(istart, iend + 1) if g[r][j] == pattern[(j - istart + phase) % p])

# Solid and pattern application functions (apply_solid, apply_pattern) are helpful for modifying segments directly.
# period_dict = {1: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 8: 4, 9: 2} is a useful hardcoded mapping for color-to-period.
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but get_solid_matches and the phase function assume exact matches including to s in patterns—might overcount if 2s are present, as they won't match c or s but aren't skipped in matching logic. No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components of non-s, non-2); the code treats rows independently, which may not capture 2D shapes—future attempts might need blob extraction for vertical alignment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating solid handling of wall detection, dominant color selection, and pattern/solid choice for simpler cases.
 * Worked well for cases with clear vertical walls and uniform row segments, as evidenced by correct training outputs.
 * What worked: Accurate wall finding (includes edges), dominant color with >50% threshold prevents false fills, phase selection maximizes fit, comparison to solid fill chooses better option, side-frame shrinking preserves boundaries.
 * What didn't work: In complex tests, 2s persist in output (e.g., positions like columns 3-4 in several rows), suggesting segments containing 2s either skipped (no dominant) or patterns didn't overwrite them effectively—unknown why, possibly because 2s dilute dominance or segments are too narrow/mixed.
 * Missed potential vertical consistency: Fills are per-row, but test output shows repeating row patterns (e.g., every 3 rows similar), hinting at multi-row objects that need cross-row propagation.
 * Side matching skips too aggressively if istart/iend are 2s (not handled, as side check is !=s and equal), potentially leaving narrow segments unfilled.
 * No handling for 8 as a fillable color in patterns (period 4), but test has many 8s—might over-apply solids.
 * Training successes suggest core segmentation and filling logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in mixed/2-heavy segments.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies major walls (e.g., edges all 8s, some internal full-8 columns implied), fills many segments with patterns (e.g., repeating 3s in row 1 between walls, 1-8-1 patterns around columns 9-12, 4-8-4 or solid 4s around 16-19, 9-8-9 later), and shows repetition across rows (e.g., rows 2-4, 6-8 similar with 2s in cols 3-4, 1s in 9-12, etc.), suggesting it's rendering a multi-row image like letters or icons.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Persistent 2s in specific positions (e.g., rows 3,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,19,21,22,24,25: columns 3-4 often 2,2; row 24 has 8,2 in col 3) indicate unfilled or skipped areas—these should likely be overwritten by patterns/solids if in valid segments, but weren't, possibly because 2s prevent dominance (>50% fails) or segments exclude them via side logic.
 * Repetitive structure (e.g., every other row has 8,8,8 in cols 3-5 vs. 2,2) looks like an attempt to draw shapes (perhaps "E" or bars with 3/1/4/9), but inconsistencies like row 24's partial 2 suggest incomplete processing—expected output should eliminate all 2s for a clean pattern.
 * Solid fills appear in places (e.g., row 1 all 8s outside, 3s in segments), but patterned areas have s=8 insertions that might disrupt if phase is wrong; test has many such, but if expected is smoother solids, this over-applies patterns.
 * Overall, output is better than raw input (assuming input had more 2s), but lingering 2s and row variations without vertical alignment mean it's not matching a coherent final image—needs better 2-handling or cross-row logic to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a background color B (likely 8 in the test) forms vertical walls (full-height columns), dividing the grid into horizontal sections that need to be cleaned or filled based on detected patterns of a single foreground color S (from a limited set like 1-4,9). The goal is to identify repeating block patterns of S separated by B or solid fills of S in the inner parts of sections, choosing the best fit to minimize errors and maximize matches against the noisy input.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly vertical columns entirely filled with B; they include the grid edges (columns 0 and w-1) and any internal full-B columns, and they remain unchanged.
 * Sections between walls (subrows) may have optional side decorations (matching colors at the start/end, not B), so the "inner" is the subrow excluding those sides if they exist and match.
 * For filling to apply, the inner must contain exactly one unique non-B, non-side color (S), and S must be in {1,2,3,4,8,9} (but 8 is B, so effectively 1-4,9); multiple candidates or invalid S skips the section.
 * Patterns are horizontal: compute consecutive block lengths of S in the inner (ignoring non-S), find the mode (most frequent) block size K (max if ties), then test phases (0 to K) for a repeating cycle of K S's followed by 1 B, scoring by mismatches (non-2 cells not matching expected S/B) and presences (existing S where expected).
 * Compare pattern score to solid S fill score (mismatches: non-S non-2 cells; presences: existing S cells); prefer solid if equal mismatches but more presences, or strictly fewer mismatches; 2 seems to be a wildcard/unknown that doesn't count as mismatch.
 * Filling modifies the inner in-place and copies back to the row, but only if conditions met; empty inners or no blocks skip.
 * Process each row independently, but walls are global (same for all rows); unchanged cells (noise like stray 1,2,4,9) persist if no pattern detected.
 * Subtle: Block counting skips non-S cells without counting them as separators (only consecutive S runs); mode K=0 skips. Phases wrap modulo (K+1). Side colors block inner if present and non-B.
 * Edge cases: Zero-length subrows/inners skip; ties in mode take max K; best phase prefers lower ph on tie. B is assumed g[0][0], but should verify consistency.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes minimal changes: only fill sections with strong single-S evidence, preferring patterns that align with existing data over solid fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations detailed, but it builds on pattern recognition logic that succeeded on training.
 * What worked: Correctly identified and filled simple horizontal sections with single S and clear block modes in training examples 1 and 2 (full correctness), demonstrating solid wall detection, candidate S filtering, mode computation, phase/solid comparison, and in-place filling/rebasing.
 * What didn't work: In the test, filling is incomplete—many sections remain noisy (e.g., scattered 1s, 2s, 4s, 9s persist), suggesting skips due to multiple candidates in inners, invalid S, or no blocks/mode=0; horizontal-only processing may miss vertical or diagonal patterns if the puzzle has them (unknown, but output irregularity hints at this). Side color detection works but may over-exclude inners in complex sections. No global consistency check across rows (e.g., same S/pattern per section vertically), leading to row-by-row inconsistencies like filled 3-strips in rows 1/27 but noisy middles. Block counting ignores non-S as separators, which may fail if noise creates false short blocks. S set includes 8 (B), but logic skips it anyway—redundant but harmless.
 * The main program loop correctly sections per row using global walls and handles side/inner extraction, but skips too conservatively (e.g., if any inner has extra colors like 1+4, whole section untouched).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though compute_best_phase assumes horizontal linearity—may need vertical extension if patterns align column-wise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves wall columns (likely positions with all 8s) as 8s, fills some horizontal strips with clean groups of 3s (e.g., row 1: repeating 6x3 +8; row 27 similar), and preserves edges/full-8 rows (0 and 28), indicating successful detection of S=3 in simple sections with mode K~6.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: middle rows (e.g., 2-26) retain heavy noise like isolated 1s, pairs of 2s, blocks of 4s, and 9s (e.g., row 2: 8,3,8,1,8,1,8,1,...; row 4: ...9,9,8,...), which weren't filled, suggesting the program skipped due to multiple candidates (1,2,4,9 all present in some inners) or low block evidence; this leaves the grid patchy/inconsistent vertically (e.g., column ~3 has 3 in row1 but 1/2 in row2-3). Expected output should likely clean more sections to uniform S/B patterns (perhaps S=3 dominant, with vertical alignment), minimizing all noise—current output has ~20-30% unclean cells per noisy row, far from a "solved" puzzle. Unknown if input had vertical patterns requiring cross-row logic, but output's row-variation implies the horizontal-only approach misses this, producing suboptimal fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to identify background elements, detect vertical "walls" (full-height background columns), and fill inner sections between walls in each row with either a solid color or a periodic pattern based on dominant colors, while respecting special values like 2 (possibly unknowns or obstacles) and predefined periods for certain colors. The process prioritizes minimizing mismatches with existing non-background/non-2 cells and maximizing presence of the target color, with fallback logic for cases without a clear dominant color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (s) is detected as the top-left cell value, assuming uniform background; all processing skips rows without background on both edges.
 * Walls are strictly vertical full-height background columns, including edges; sections between walls are processed independently per row, but only if the row starts/ends with background.
 * Dominant color in a section is the unique non-background/non-2 color present; it must be in period_dict (e.g., {1:2, 3:3, 4:2, 8:4, 9:2}) to qualify for patterning, otherwise fallback applies.
 * Patterns are repeating units like [c, c, ..., s] (period-1 times c, then background s), with phase-shifting to best fit existing cells; solid fill is an alternative if it has fewer mismatches or equal mismatches but more target color presences.
 * Sections may "shrink" if side cells (adjacent to walls) match and aren't background, excluding them from inner filling to preserve borders.
 * Value 2 acts as a wildcard/unknown: ignored in dominant color detection and mismatch calculations, but preserved (not overwritten) in pattern/solid applications.
 * Fallback triggers if no dominant color: only applies if section has 2s and was shrunk, using side color for pattern/solid if valid in period_dict.
 * Processing is row-by-row, creating a deep copy of the grid; empty sections (inner_start > inner_end) are skipped.
 * Potential edge cases: all-2 sections, no valid colors, non-period colors, uneven section lengths not divisible by period, or walls creating tiny/zero-width sections.
 * The puzzle likely involves nonogram-like filling or pattern completion, where outputs should visually complete symmetric or repeating motifs without altering walls/background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This reliably identifies the background color from the top-left, assuming uniformity.)

```python
def find_walls(g: List[List[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:
    walls = [0, w - 1]
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
        if all(g[i][j] == s for i in range(h)):
            walls.append(j)
    return sorted(set(walls))
```
(This correctly identifies vertical wall columns as full-height background lines, including fixed edges.)

```python
def get_dominant_color(row: List[int], start: int, end: int, s: int) -> int:
    vals = [row[j] for j in range(start, end + 1) if row[j] != s and row[j] != 2]
    if not vals:
        return -1
    uniq = set(vals)
    if len(uniq) != 1:
        return -1
    c = list(uniq)[0]
    if c in period_dict:
        return c
    return -1
```
(This extracts a valid dominant color for patterning, ignoring background and 2s; returns -1 if ambiguous, empty, or non-period color.)

```python
def compute_pattern_mis_and_pres(row: List[int], inner_start: int, inner_end: int, unit: List[int], p: int, c: int, s: int) -> tuple[int, int, int]:
    L = inner_end - inner_start + 1
    best_mis = float('inf')
    best_pres = -1
    best_ph = 0
    for ph in range(p):
        mis = 0
        pres = 0
        for jj in range(inner_start, inner_end + 1):
            idx = (jj - inner_start + ph) % p
            exp = unit[idx]
            if row[jj] != 2 and row[jj] != exp:
                mis += 1
            if row[jj] == c and exp == c:
                pres += 1
        if mis < best_mis or (mis == best_mis and (pres > best_pres or (pres == best_pres and ph < best_ph))):
            best_mis = mis
            best_pres = pres
            best_ph = ph
    return best_mis, best_pres, best_ph
```
(This evaluates the best phase for a periodic pattern, scoring mismatches (non-2 cells not matching expected) and color presences; useful for deciding pattern viability.)

```python
def compute_solid_mis_and_pres(row: List[int], inner_start: int, inner_end: int, c: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    mis = 0
    pres = 0
    for jj in range(inner_start, inner_end + 1):
        if row[jj] != 2 and row[jj] != c:
            mis += 1
        if row[jj] == c:
            pres += 1
    return mis, pres
```
(This scores solid fills similarly, ignoring 2s in mismatches but counting presences; pairs with pattern scorer for choice.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1 and 2 both produced correct outputs, indicating strong handling of basic wall detection, section isolation, dominant color extraction, and pattern/solid application with mismatch minimization.
 * The core logic for phase-shifting patterns and comparing to solids worked well for training cases, preserving 2s and shrinking sections appropriately.
 * Fallback logic (using side colors when no dominant) appears functional in training but untested here.
 * The execution error ('bool' object is not callable) on test input stems from a bug: `apply_solid_to_inner` is assigned a boolean (True/False) but later called as a function (e.g., `apply_solid_to_inner(new_g[r], ...)`), causing the crash; this prevents any output generation.
 * Wall finding and background detection seem robust, as they passed training without issues.
 * Section processing skips correctly for edge cases like no inner area or non-background rows.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., apply_pattern_to_inner, process_section) are relevant but the bool-as-function bug breaks integration in process_section.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates good understanding of pattern periods and scoring, but the coding error halted test execution entirely.

**Test output:**
 * No output was generated for the test input due to the execution error ('bool' object is not callable), likely occurring in process_section when attempting to call the boolean `apply_solid_to_inner` as a function after setting it to True/False based on scoring.
 * Without output, it's impossible to verify if the filled grid matches expected puzzle completion (e.g., correct patterns in sections, preserved 2s, no wall alterations); mentally simulating, the test likely involves a grid with walls, 2s, and partial patterns needing phase-aligned fills or solids, but the error means nothing was produced to compare.
 * The error suggests the test input triggered the solid-fallback path (where apply_solid_to_inner is set to a bool), which training may not have hit; this differs from expectations as training succeeded without crashing, implying test has unique section configurations (e.g., dominant color leading to solid choice).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 15:20:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely a maze or patterned artwork) where cells are numbered (e.g., 8 as background/wall, 2 as unknowns to fill, and other numbers like 1,3,4,9 as colors or elements), and the goal is to fill unknowns based on detecting enclosed sections bounded by walls, then applying either solid fills or periodic patterns (stripes or repeating units) that match the dominant color and observed hints within those sections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid sections are defined by vertical walls (columns where all rows are background B=8), with horizontal boundaries implied by top/bottom background rows; sections between walls may have side borders if matching non-background colors on edges.
 * Unknowns (2s) should be filled only within inner sections (excluding walls and side borders), prioritizing periodic patterns over solid fills based on mismatch counts (how many known cells don't fit the pattern) and presence scores (how many known cells match the expected pattern positions); patterns use predefined periods (e.g., 3 for color 3, meaning a repeating unit like [3,3,8] for stripes).
 * Dominant color C for a section must appear >50% in non-ignored cells (ignoring B and sides), be in period_dict, and not be 2; if no valid C, skip filling.
 * Patterns are phase-shifted to best match existing known cells (non-2s); unit is constructed as (p-1) times C followed by B, assuming sparse stripes ending in background gaps.
 * Subtleties: Side borders (matching colors on section edges) shrink the inner fill area and are ignored in dominant color calc; vertical walls include left/right edges (0 and w-1); only process rows fully bounded by B on edges; repeated sections (e.g., multiple identical striped areas) must handle phase consistently per row but independently; 1s appear as sparse elements (possibly periods of 2: [1,8]), but program assumes stripe-like for all; potential over-ignoring if sides match C; no vertical pattern detection—only horizontal per row; 4 and 9 seem to have solid or alternating fills (period 2: e.g., [4,8] or [4,4,8,8]?), but unit construction may not fit solids perfectly; test grid has repeating row patterns (every 3 rows cycle with 2s in similar positions), suggesting vertical consistency missed; background detection assumes top-left, but entire border is 8s.
 * Easy to miss: Phases must maximize matches only on knowns, but score uses total known mismatches; solid fill as fallback only if pattern mismatches more or equal but fewer presences; no handling for mixed patterns or non-periodic fills; 2s outside sections (e.g., near edges) may remain unfilled; program copies grid but only fills horizontal sections per row, ignoring vertical correlations.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of wall-bounded sections, dominant color detection, and pattern-vs-solid choice via mismatch/presence scoring.
 * Unit construction assumes stripes as [C]*(p-1) + [B], which works for training (likely sparse patterns) but may fail for denser or alternating patterns (e.g., for 4 or 9 with period 2, it becomes [C, B], but test shows solid-like [4,4,4,4] in some spots, suggesting unit or period_dict mismatch).
 * Skips sections without valid dominant C (>50%, in dict, not 2), which is good, but in test, many sections with 1s (period 2?) or mixed 4/9 get skipped or solid-filled incorrectly, leaving 2s.
 * Only fills rows with edge B, but test has consistent vertical patterns (e.g., repeating every 3 rows), so horizontal-only filling misses vertical consistency (e.g., 2s in columns 3-4 across rows should align to same phase).
 * get_pattern_scores has redundancy (calls get_best_phase_and_matches but overrides with passed best_phase); minor bug but doesn't break training.
 * No extraction of "objects" like full vertical patterns or 1s as special cases (e.g., 1s seem like dots or separators, not stripes); program treats all as horizontal stripes, which fits training but not test's complex mixes (1s with 8s, 4s solid, 9s patterned).
 * Helpful: Wall finding and scoring functions are solid and reusable; dominant color ignores sides correctly.
 * Unhelpful/broken: period_dict includes 8:4, but 8 is B—irrelevant and could cause skips; unit always ends in B, assuming gaps, but test has solid blocks without B gaps (e.g., [4,4,4,4]); no vertical processing, so useless for aligned columns.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially fills the grid (e.g., some 2s replaced with 4s/9s in later sections, patterns like [3,8] repeated), but many 2s remain unfilled (e.g., rows 3-4,7-8,10-11 have [8,3,8,2,2,8,3,...] unchanged in early columns; similar in other row cycles), indicating incomplete section detection or skipped fills due to dominant color failing (>50% threshold or invalid C for 1-heavy sections).
 * It does not look correct: Expected output should fully resolve all 2s into coherent patterns (e.g., vertical alignment for repeating motifs like checkerboard 4s or dotted 1s, solid 9 blocks without gaps, striped 3s consistent across rows), but generated has isolated 2 pairs (e.g., positions 3-4 in multiple rows) and mismatched fills (e.g., row 4 has [3,8,1,8,1,3] for 1s, but nearby 2s unfilled; row 24 has [8,3,8,8,2,8,...] with single 2, suggesting partial solid but incomplete). Differences: Unfilled 2s in left sections (likely 1-pattern or solid 3 missed), inconsistent phasing (e.g., 9s alternate [9,8] but not vertically synced), and top/bottom all-8 rows correct but inner lacks full pattern completion—probably because program doesn't propagate vertically or adjust units for non-stripe cases like solids. Unknown why some sections (e.g., 4s) fill solidly while others (early 2s) skip, but likely dominant C calc fails on mixed/low-density areas.
