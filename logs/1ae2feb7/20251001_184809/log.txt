=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 18:48:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 18:50:59] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def find_trunk_position(row: List[int]) -> int:
    non_zeros = [c for c in range(len(row)) if row[c] != 0]
    return max(non_zeros) if non_zeros else -1

def find_blocks(row: List[int], T: int) -> List[tuple]:
    blocks = []
    c = 0
    N_left = T
    while c < N_left:
        if row[c] == 0:
            c += 1
            continue
        C = row[c]
        start = c

        end = c - 1
        L = end - start + 1

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 18:52:02] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where each row represents a horizontal pattern, likely a tree-like or branching structure, with a central "trunk" marked by the value 4. The task is to complete the right side of each row by repeating and selecting block patterns (consecutive runs of the same non-zero color value) from the left side of the trunk, using rules based on block lengths, distances from the trunk, and prioritization when multiple blocks match a position.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Each row is processed independently; the trunk position T is the rightmost non-zero value before any trailing zeros, but in practice, it's often the position of the 4, which acts as a fixed pivot or branch point.
 * Blocks are only extracted from the left side of the trunk (positions 0 to T inclusive, but stopping before the trunk if it's 4); a block is a maximal consecutive sequence of the same color C > 0, with length L and distance dist = T - end - 1 (where end is the last index of the block).
 * On the right side (positions T+1 to N-1), for each position p, compute rel = p - (T + 1); check which blocks have rel % L == 0, collect candidates as (dist, C), sort by increasing dist then increasing C, and fill with the chosen C if any candidates exist (otherwise leave as 0).
 * Subtlety: If no blocks exist left of the trunk, the right side remains all 0s. Also, existing non-zero values on the right are preserved unless overwritten by a candidate (but in the code, it always overwrites if candidates, potentially ignoring input values on right—though training passed, so likely inputs have 0s there).
 * Multiple blocks can compete for a position if rel matches multiple L's; always prefer the one with smallest dist (closer to trunk), breaking ties by smallest C.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks skip over 0s on the left (only consecutive non-zeros count as a block); trunk can be at different positions per row; rows with no non-zeros skip entirely.
 * Grid is M rows by N columns (N=20 in test); output is the full modified grid.
 * Considerations from logic: dist measures how "outer" the block is (smaller dist = closer to trunk, higher priority); modulo ensures periodic repetition scaled by L.
 * Potential edge cases: All-zero rows; trunk at edge (T=0 or T=N-1); overlapping periods from multiple blocks; input non-zeros on right that might conflict (but code overwrites, and training passed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_trunk_position(row: List[int]) -> int:
    non_zeros = [c for c in range(len(row)) if row[c] != 0]
    return max(non_zeros) if non_zeros else -1
```
(This correctly finds the rightmost non-zero position as T; helpful for identifying the pivot, assuming 4 is always at or near it.)

```python
def find_blocks(row: List[int], T: int) -> List[tuple]:
    blocks = []
    c = 0
    N_left = T  # Note: This should be T+1? But code uses T, effectively up to index T-1; works if trunk at T is not included in blocks.
    while c < N_left:
        if row[c] == 0:
            c += 1
            continue
        C = row[c]
        start = c
        while c < N_left and row[c] == C:
            c += 1
        end = c - 1
        L = end - start + 1
        dist = T - end - 1
        blocks.append((C, L, dist))
    return blocks
```
(This extracts left blocks accurately, skipping 0s and computing L and dist correctly; essential for pattern identification.)

```python
def fill_right(row: List[int], T: int, blocks: List[tuple], N: int) -> List[int]:
    result_row = row[:]
    for p in range(T + 1, N):
        rel = p - (T + 1)
        candidates = []
        for C, L, dist in blocks:
            if rel % L == 0:
                candidates.append((dist, C))
        if candidates:
            candidates.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
            _, chosen_C = candidates[0]
            result_row[p] = chosen_C
    return result_row
```
(This implements the filling logic with proper candidate selection and sorting; core to solving, handles multiples via priority.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    M = len(g)
    N = len(g[0])
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(M):
        T = find_trunk_position(g[r])
        if T == -1:
            continue
        blocks = find_blocks(g[r], T)
        result[r] = fill_right(g[r], T, blocks, N)
    return result
```
(Orchestrates per-row processing; simple and effective, copies input to avoid mutation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it fully succeeded on all three training examples, correctly identifying trunks, extracting blocks, and filling rights with prioritized repetitions.
 * No misses on training: All outputs matched expected completions, demonstrating understanding of block extraction, modulo-based placement, and candidate sorting.
 * Subtle element handled well: Prioritizing by dist then C prevents overwriting with distant patterns when closer ones match.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided functions are relevant and correct (none are broken).
 * General consideration: Future attempts should preserve this structure but watch for cases where trunk includes part of a block (code stops before T, which worked for training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks correct and consistent with the puzzle rules; for example, row 0 repeats 5 every 4 positions (L=4, dist=0) starting right after trunk at index 5. Row 1 alternates 1 every 2 (but only on even rel). Row 2 fills all right with 2 (L=1). Row 5 alternates 6 and 7 by competing blocks (L=2 dist=0 for 6 beats L=1 dist=2 for 7 on even rel, and vice versa on odd). Row 7 mixes 8 (L=3 dist=0) and 6 (L=2 dist=3) with 0s where no match, e.g., 8 at rel=0,6,9,12; 6 at rel=2,4,8,10; exactly matching the generated [8,0,6,8,6,0,8,0,6,8,6,0,8,0] from p=6 onward—no differences from expected based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Rows 3,4,6,8,9 correctly leave rights as 0s (no left blocks).
 * No observed effects differ from expectations; fillings are periodic, prioritized correctly, and respect 0-gaps; this handles the test input properly without anomalies.
