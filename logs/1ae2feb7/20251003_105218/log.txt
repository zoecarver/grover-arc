=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 10:52:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 11:00:10] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def fill(width: int, runs: List[Tuple[int, int]], mod_offset: int = 0) -> List[int]:
    if not runs:
        return [0] * width

    pattern = [0] * width
    slot_indices: List[int] = []

        else:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:01:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or patterns, where the left portion of each row provides run-length encoded sequences of colors that must be recursively extrapolated to fill the right portion of the grid using modular offsets and slot-filling logic. The goal is to complete the grid while preserving the input's left side and applying consistent rules across rows, with the starting column for processing determined by the first non-zero position in the first row.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Runs are built by scanning leftward from a fixed column 'r' (determined solely from the first row's first non-zero position) and counting consecutive identical values, but this assumes uniform structure across all rows, which may fail if later rows have different left-side patterns or no non-zeros.
 * The fill function uses modular arithmetic (i % n == mod_offset) to place initial colors, then recursively fills "slots" (zero positions) with sub-patterns, adjusting offsets like (n - 1) % next_n, which handles nested patterns but can produce all-zero outputs if runs are empty or misaligned.
 * Subtle offset calculation (e.g., sub_offset = (n - 1) % next_n) is crucial for aligning sub-patterns in slots, but it may not account for cases where rows have no runs or where the grid has varying row lengths/structures.
 * The code copies the entire input grid to result and only overwrites the right side (from r + 1), leaving left sides intact, but if 'r' is incorrectly inferred from the first row, it misapplies to other rows.
 * Empty runs lead to all-zero fills, which is correct for blank rows but may incorrectly zero out expected patterns if run extraction skips non-left-aligned inputs.
 * Width calculation w = cols - r - 1 assumes a single "gap" at r, but puzzles might have multiple gaps or varying per-row structures.
 * Recursive depth is limited by run length, but infinite recursion is avoided by base case; however, mismatched run lengths between rows can cause inconsistent outputs.
 * All rows use the same 'r' from the first row, which works if the puzzle has aligned "seed" columns but fails for misaligned or row-specific seeds.
 * Integers represent colors (e.g., 0 for empty, positive for filled), and patterns must not overwrite existing right-side values (though code assumes right side starts empty).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def fill(width: int, runs: List[Tuple[int, int]], mod_offset: int = 0) -> List[int]:
    if not runs:
        return [0] * width
    c, n = runs[0]
    pattern = [0] * width
    slot_indices: List[int] = []
    for i in range(width):
        if (i % n) == mod_offset:
            pattern[i] = c
        else:
            slot_indices.append(i)
    if len(runs) > 1:
        sub_runs = runs[1:]
        next_n = sub_runs[0][1]
        sub_offset = (n - 1) % next_n
        sub_pattern = fill(len(slot_indices), sub_runs, sub_offset)
        for j, idx in enumerate(slot_indices):
            pattern[idx] = sub_pattern[j]
    return pattern
```
(This recursive fill function correctly handles modular placement and sub-pattern filling for nested runs, and it worked well for training cases.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    num_rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    # Find r from first row
    r = next((i for i, val in enumerate(g[0]) if val != 0), None)
    if r is None:
        return [row[:] for row in g]
    result = [row[:] for row in g]
    for row_idx in range(num_rows):
        row = g[row_idx]
        # Build runs: closest first
        runs: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
        i = r - 1
        while i >= 0:
            if row[i] == 0:
                i -= 1
                continue
            c = row[i]
            n = 1
            i -= 1
            while i >= 0 and row[i] == c:
                n += 1
                i -= 1
            runs.append((c, n))
        w = cols - r - 1
        right = fill(w, runs, 0)
        for j in range(w):
            result[row_idx][r + 1 + j] = right[j]
    return result
```
(This main program function extracts runs leftward from 'r' and fills rightward, preserving input; it's core but has fixed 'r' assumption.)

(No specific extract_objects function was provided, but run extraction in program acts as one; a more flexible per-row 'r' finder could be helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, which successfully passed all three training examples by correctly extrapolating run-based patterns to the right side using modular fills.
 * Worked well for cases where all rows share the same 'r' (first non-zero column from row 0) and have left-side runs that nest properly.
 * Did not handle test input correctly, as it produced a mostly zero grid with only partial fills (first row has a single 5 at column 1 followed by zeros; row 7 is fully 6s across all columns; all other rows are entirely zero), suggesting the fixed 'r' from row 0 misaligns run extraction for rows without left-side patterns or with different structures.
 * Run extraction skips zeros but builds runs in reverse order (closest to 'r' first), which is correct for the recursive fill but may reverse intended nesting if puzzle expects forward scanning.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the global 'r' assumption is a flaw (not row-specific), leading to empty runs (and thus zero fills) for most test rows.
 * Training successes imply core run-length and modular fill logic is sound, but test failure highlights need for per-row 'r' detection or handling of all-zero left rows differently (e.g., no fill or copy patterns from above).
 * Offset logic like (n - 1) % next_n worked for training but may misalign in test if run lengths don't match across rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it results in an almost entirely zero grid (9 out of 10 rows are all zeros, with only row 0 having [0, 5, 0, ...] and row 7 having all 6s), which suggests incomplete extrapolation—likely the fixed 'r' from row 0 caused empty runs for most rows, filling nothing on the right, while row 7's full 6s implies it had a solid run but overwrote left side unexpectedly (code should only fill right of r+1).
 * Expected output should propagate patterns per row independently, potentially filling more rows with nested modular patterns based on their own left-side runs, rather than leaving most blank; the single 5 in row 0 indicates partial detection but no recursion, and the full 6s row mismatches the "right-only" fill intent (possibly 'r' was 0 or -1 for that row, causing full overwrite).
 * This differs from training successes, where full right-side patterns were generated correctly; the test likely has row-specific or sparse left patterns that the global 'r' breaks, leading to unintended all-zero or full-row fills instead of targeted modular placements.
 * Without the exact test input grid, the discrepancy is unclear (e.g., unknown if test has varying 'r' per row or empty lefts), but the output's sparsity indicates it does not match a properly completed puzzle, as visual puzzles typically fill consistently across rows.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:01:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def find_spine_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:05:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a central "spine" column is identified based on consistent non-zero values across rows, and patterns (runs of identical numbers) to the left of the spine in each row are projected periodically to the right using the run length as the period, filling zeros with the run's value. The goal is to transform the input grid into a completed version following these projection rules without altering existing non-zero values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine column must be chosen as the one with the highest count of rows sharing the exact same non-zero value in that column; if ties exist, the code picks the first one with max count, but subtleties may arise if multiple columns qualify or if the spine value varies slightly across rows (though the code requires uniformity).
 * Runs are only identified and projected from the left side of the spine (positions 0 to spine_col-1); right-side patterns are not projected back or used as sources.
 * Projection starts immediately after the spine (spine_col + 1) and repeats every 'n' positions where n is the run length found to the left; it only fills zeros and skips/overwrites nothing if a position is already non-zero (per the code's 'if g_row[pos] == 0').
 * Runs are consecutive identical non-zeros, but the code scans leftward from the spine, skipping zeros until hitting a non-zero, then counts the run backward; this can miss isolated runs or handle multiple runs per row by iterating backward.
 * Subtlety: Empty rows (all zeros) or rows with no left-side runs should remain unchanged; also, if no spine is found (all columns inconsistent or empty), no projections occur.
 * Projections do not wrap around the row ends; they stop at the row's length.
 * Existing non-zeros to the right should not be overwritten, but the code only fills zeros, which is correct; however, if a projection lands on a conflicting non-zero, it stays as-is (potential subtlety if puzzle expects resolution).
 * Grid may have varying patterns like alternating values (e.g., 6,7,6,7) that form runs of length 1, projecting single fills periodically.
 * All rows are processed independently after spine selection, which is global.
 * Zeros act as blanks; non-zeros are "inked" and define patterns.
 * Potential miss: If the spine column itself has mixed values or zeros in some rows, it may not qualify, leading to no spine (-1 return) and no projections.
 * Another subtlety: Run finding starts from spine-1 and moves left, handling multiple disjoint runs by jumping over zeros and subtracting n after each.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_spine_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    max_count = 0
    spine_col = -1
    for s in range(cols):
        non_zeros = [g[r][s] for r in range(rows) if g[r][s] != 0]
        if non_zeros:
            c = non_zeros[0]
            if all(x == c for x in non_zeros):
                count = len(non_zeros)
                if count > max_count:
                    max_count = count
                    spine_col = s
    return spine_col
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by finding the column with the most uniform non-zero values across rows; it's essential and worked well for training cases.)

```python
def find_run_length(g_row: List[int], start: int, c: int) -> int:
    n = 1
    i = start - 1
    while i >= 0 and g_row[i] == c:
        n += 1
        i -= 1
    return n
```
(This backward-counting run length finder is helpful for locating consecutive runs starting from a hit position; it handles length-1 runs correctly but assumes the start position is already 'c'.)

```python
def project_run(g_row: List[int], spine_col: int, c: int, n: int) -> None:
    for pos in range(spine_col + 1, len(g_row), n):
        if g_row[pos] == 0:
            g_row[pos] = c
```
(This in-place projector is key for filling right-side zeros periodically; it skips non-zeros, which aligns with not overwriting existing ink, but may need adjustment if periods overlap conflicting runs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program successfully passed all three training examples, indicating solid core logic for spine detection and basic left-to-right projection in simpler cases.
 * What worked: Uniform spine selection and run projection handled consistent patterns well, such as repeating blocks or single-value fills in training grids.
 * What didn't work: The backward scanning in the main loop (while i >=0, skipping zeros, finding runs, then i -= n) may skip or mishandle multiple disjoint runs separated by zeros to the left of the spine, potentially under-projecting in complex rows.
 * No explicit handling for cases with no spine (returns -1, leading to no changes), which might be fine but could fail if test expects a default spine.
 * The projection only fills zeros but doesn't verify if the filled positions align with expected puzzle symmetry or avoid conflicts; training passed, but this may not generalize.
 * Function `find_spine_column` is helpful and correct for the puzzle's global spine rule.
 * Functions `find_run_length` and `project_run` are helpful but limited—`find_run_length` counts backward only, which works for contiguous runs but assumes no forward extension needed.
 * The main `program` function copies the grid correctly (to avoid mutating input) and processes rows independently, which is good; however, it only iterates over left-side runs without considering right-side validation.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the main loop's zero-skipping logic might be overly simplistic for rows with interspersed zeros and short runs.
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates understanding of spine and projection but likely misses subtleties in run detection for gapped left sides, leading to incomplete fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; while some projections appear (e.g., row 0 has periodic 5's starting after presumed spine at col 5, and row 2 has long 2's run), there are inconsistencies like row 7 having mixed 6's and 8's with zeros in between, suggesting incomplete or wrong-period projections (e.g., alternating patterns like 6,8,6 may need length-1 or 2 runs but aren't fully extended).
 * Row 1 shows 1's projected periodically from col 3 onward, but with a 4 at col 5 (spine?) and sparse fills (e.g., positions 3,4,6,10,12,14,...), which matches a run length of ~2 but leaves many zeros unfilled, indicating the run detection might have missed a longer or multiple left-side run.
 * Row 5 has an alternating 6,7 pattern starting from col 2, which looks like a projection of length-1 or 2 runs, but it's dense without zeros, suggesting it worked partially; however, the spine 4 at col 5 is consistent.
 * Rows 3,4,6,9 are mostly zeros with only a 4 at col 5, implying no left-side runs detected, which may be correct if inputs had no left patterns, but seems too sparse if puzzle expects propagation.
 * Row 7's pattern (6,6,8's with interspersed 0's and 6's) looks erratic—e.g., 8's at cols 3,4,5,7,9,13,15,17 but zeros at 7,11,13? Wait, printed as [6,6,8,8,8,4,8,0,6,8,6,0,8,0,6,8,6,0,8,0], so projections hit some zeros but left others, possibly due to step size not matching expected period (e.g., if n=2 for 8's, it skips some).
 * Row 8 and others have isolated fills, but the overall grid feels under-filled compared to what a full projection should produce; for example, if left runs are longer, more positions should be inked, but many trailing zeros remain.
 * The output matches the code's logic (fills only zeros post-spine periodically), but differs from expected by not fully resolving complex left patterns (e.g., unknown input, but output sparsity suggests missed runs); it's partially sensible for simple cases but incorrect for the test's likely gapped or multi-run rows.
 * No obvious overwrites, which is good, but the lack of fills in empty rows (e.g., row 9 all zeros) is correct only if no propagation crosses rows—puzzle is row-independent.
