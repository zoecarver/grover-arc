=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 20:12:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 20:16:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based coloring puzzle (30x30) divided by a full separator line of 1's (horizontal row or vertical column) into a "legend" side (with pre-colored shapes indicating available colors) and a "picture" side (with outlines in various numbers and blank regions marked as 5's to be filled). The goal is to identify connected components of 5's on the picture side via flood fill and assign colors from the legend's unique colors (excluding 0 and 5), likely in a specific order such as cycling by component discovery or matching by shape/size/position, while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator must be a complete row or column entirely filled with 1's; prioritize horizontal search first, then vertical if none found—missing this leads to no separation and no filling.
 * Legend side extraction: Scan the designated legend area (e.g., above horizontal sep or right of vertical sep) row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to collect unique colors !=0 and !=5 in the order they first appear; this order seems critical for assignment, but simply cycling by discovery order fails as it mismatches expected color placements.
 * Picture side filling: Only fill connected components of 5's (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) using flood fill; components must be discovered in row-major order starting from the picture area (e.g., below horizontal sep or left of vertical sep); do not fill non-5 cells or cross boundaries.
 * Side orientation subtlety: For horizontal sep, legend is typically above (rows 0 to sep-1), picture below (rows sep+1 to end); for vertical sep, the code assumes legend right (cols sep+1 to end), picture left (cols 0 to sep-1), but this may be inverted in some cases (e.g., legend left, picture right), causing unfilled 5's or filling the wrong side—check which side has pre-colors vs. 5's.
 * Color assignment nuance: Not arbitrary cycling; expected outputs suggest assignment by component order (row-major discovery) but with legend colors in strict appearance order, or possibly matching components to legend shapes by size, position, or sequence—cycling works partially but leads to color swaps (e.g., 2 where 4 expected).
 * Grid boundaries: n=30 fixed; output starts as copy of input, only modify 5's in picture side; 0's are empty/background, other numbers are fixed outlines/colors—do not overwrite them.
 * Edge cases: No sep means return unchanged grid; empty legend (no colors) means no filling; multiple components may exceed legend colors, requiring cycling, but order matters; 5's may be isolated or large blobs; vertical seps may not stretch full height if code assumes they do.
 * Scanning order: All discovery (colors, components) must be consistent row-major to match expectations; stack-based flood fill is correct but ensure visited prevents overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Legend may have 5's (ignore them); components cannot cross sep (1's block); if sep not found or wrong side, 5's remain unfilled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_separator(n: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    # Finds horizontal (h) or vertical (v) full line of 1's; returns type and index, or None/-1
    sep_type = None
    sep_index = -1
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            sep_type = 'h'
            sep_index = r
            break
    if sep_type is None:
        for c in range(n):
            if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
                sep_type = 'v'
                sep_index = c
                break
    return sep_type, sep_index
```
(This works well for sep detection, as seen in partial matches in training outputs.)

```python
def extract_legend_colors(n: int, g: List[List[int]], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts unique non-0/non-5 colors from legend side in row-major order
    legend_colors = []
    seen = set()
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index):
            for c in range(n):
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index + 1, n):  # Assumes legend right; may need flip to range(sep_index)
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    return legend_colors
```
(This is helpful for color collection but may need side flip for vertical; order is key but simplistic uniqueness misses shape-based ordering.)

```python
def self_fill(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], color: int, sr: int, sc: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    # Stack-based flood fill for 5's only; marks visited and sets output to color
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This flood fill is correct and essential; prevents overfill and handles components accurately; directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)].)

```python
def color_picture_side(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], legend_colors: List[int], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> None:
    # Discovers and fills components in row-major order on picture side, cycling colors
    if not legend_colors:
        return
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component_id = 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index + 1, n):
            for c in range(n):
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index):  # Assumes picture left; may need flip to range(sep_index + 1, n)
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
```
(This is mostly helpful for component discovery but fails on color cycling/order and potential side flip; row-major scan is good.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly detects the horizontal separator in training example 1 (top legend intact, bottom filling attempted) and copies the input grid unchanged where appropriate, but fails to assign correct colors to components (e.g., uses [4,3,1,2] cycling, resulting in 2's where expected 4's in row 12 cols 12-13, 3's where 2's in row 20, and mismatches in rows 13-16/22-29; specific differences: generated row 12 has 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs. expected 4,4; row 13 has 2,2,2,2 at cols 9-12 vs. expected 4's shifted; row 17 has 3 at col 5 vs. expected nothing/0 there but 3's elsewhere).
 * For training example 2 (likely vertical sep), sep detection may succeed but side assignment is wrong (assumes legend right/picture left, but expected fills suggest legend left/picture right with 2's and 3's); many 5's remain unfilled (e.g., generated row 2 cols 14-23 are all 5's vs. expected 2's; row 4 cols 13-25 5's vs. expected 2's; row 9 cols 10-12 5's vs. expected 2's; row 20 cols 20-24 5's vs. expected 3's), and some left-side filling occurs incorrectly with 2,3,1 (e.g., row 1 cols 1-3 2's match but cols 19-20 5's unfilled vs. expected 2's).
 * Color cycling by component_id % len(legend_colors) works partially for small components but mismatches sequence (e.g., ex1 first bottom component gets 4 in generated but expected implies different start like 3 or shape-matching); unknown why exact order fails, possibly needs legend shape extraction/matching by size or position rather than scan order.
 * extract_legend_colors collects correctly for horizontal (e.g., ex1 gets [4,3,1,2]) but may collect from wrong side for vertical (ex2 legend likely left, leading to empty or wrong colors, causing no/minimal filling).
 * find_separator is reliable (no false negatives in outputs) but doesn't handle potential multiple seps or partial lines.
 * self_fill is accurate (no overfills or leaks in generated outputs) and essential for components.
 * Overall program structure (copy input, find sep, extract, fill) demonstrates core understanding but breaks on vertical orientation, color ordering, and possibly component-to-color mapping; no handling for no-sep case beyond return (but ex2 suggests sep exists); unhelpful: no shape/size matching function (needed?); visited is per-run only, correct but could miss global 5's if side wrong.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains most input numbers (e.g., 6's,4's,8's as outlines) but fails to fill 5's systematically, instead placing scattered 8's in legend/picture areas (e.g., row 1 cols 26-28 8's where likely blank/5 expected to fill; row 5 col 20 8's isolated vs. expected component fill; row 10 cols 16-21 8's but incomplete, leaving gaps like row 10 col 14 8 missing connections) and leaves many presumed 5's unfilled or mismatched (e.g., row 3 cols 13-19 partial 4's but 5's? implied unfilled; row 23 cols 5-30 heavy 8's but irregular, not matching clean components; overall, 8's appear overfilled or in wrong spots like row 0 cols 9-11, suggesting wrong legend extraction or side). This indicates sep detection succeeded (some structure preserved) but filling side/color assignment failed similarly to training (wrong vertical handling? mismatched colors like 8 overusing); does not match expected clean component fills—likely needs side flip for vertical and better color ordering to handle test's complex layout (multiple components, possible vertical sep).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 20:21:47] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    label = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    next_label = 1
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] >= 5 and label[i][j] == 0:
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] >= 5 and label[nx][ny] == 0:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            queue.append((nx, ny))

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 20:22:04] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a puzzle involving the identification and 4-coloring (using values 1-4) of distinct connected regions (blobs or components) in a grid where cells with values >=5 represent "filled" or "land" areas, and 0 represents empty space. The goal is to assign colors to these regions such that no two adjacent regions (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-color theorem principles for map coloring, while preserving the original 0s and ensuring the output grid reflects properly separated and colored regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), based on cells >=5 being grouped into components via flood-fill or BFS/DFS.
 * Coloring must ensure adjacent regions (i.e., components that touch edge-to-edge) get different colors from {1,2,3,4}; sequential modulo-4 assignment fails because it doesn't check adjacency and can assign the same color to neighbors.
 * Preserve exact shapes of regions: output must match input connectivity for >=5 cells, replacing them with colors but keeping 0s unchanged; subtle patterns like stripes, isolated cells, or irregular blobs must be respected without merging or splitting.
 * Input grids likely have values >=5 as uniform "filled" (ignoring exact value beyond threshold), but outputs show structured patterns (e.g., horizontal/vertical stripes in top of train1, clustered blobs in lower areas), suggesting regions are predefined shapes that need proper separation.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components: each gets a unique color relative to its neighbors; global sequential labeling ignores graph structure (adjacency graph of components).
 * Empty rows/columns of 0s act as separators; do not color them.
 * Subtle: Some regions in expected outputs appear to be single cells or small groups (e.g., isolated 1s or 3s), while others are larger; the program over-labels large areas uniformly but fails on color conflicts.
 * Threshold >=5 is key for identifying filled cells; cells <5 (likely 0-4) stay as-is or are treated as empty, but in outputs, low numbers like 1-4 are colors, so inputs probably use high values only for filled.
 * Potential for odd-shaped adjacencies: regions can interlock or touch at edges without sharing cells, requiring adjacency check post-component extraction.
 * All training examples show patterned regions (e.g., train1 has cross-like or barred patterns in colors 1-4), implying the puzzle may involve recognizing or enforcing specific topologies like non-overlapping territories.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies connected components using BFS flood-fill for cells >=5, which works for extracting region shapes (e.g., top rows in train1 match expected patterns for 4,3,1,2 regions).
 * However, it fails on coloring: assigns colors via (label-1) % 4 + 1, which is sequential and ignores adjacency, leading to same-color adjacent regions (e.g., in train1 lower sections, generated has mismatched 1,2,3,4 placements like row9 having 1s where expected has 4s, and row11 having 3s vs expected 1s; unknown why shapes differ slightly in lower blobs, possibly due to over-merging or incorrect labeling start).
 * Train1 generated matches expected exactly in rows 1-3 (patterned 4,3,1,2 stripes) and row5 (all 1s? wait, generated row5 all 0s but expected row5 all 0s, row6 all 1s matches), but diverges in rows 8+ (e.g., generated row9 has 0,0,0,2,2,2,0... with 1s misplaced; expected has 0s, then 4s in row8; generated incorrectly labels small blobs as continuing prior colors).
 * Train2 generated matches top rows partially (2,3,1 patterns), but mismatches in mid-sections (e.g., row2 has 1s where expected has 2s in a cluster; row10 has 3s where expected has 2s), and lower areas like row23 have scattered 3s/4s vs expected structured 3s.
 * No samples pass, indicating core issue is lack of graph coloring; sequential mod-4 is broken for adjacency conflicts.
 * The labeling function is helpful for extraction but insufficient alone; needs adjacency detection and greedy/backtracking coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the direct output assignment in the attempt (without saving components first) makes debugging hard; future attempts should separate extraction from coloring.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows fragmented and inconsistent coloring (e.g., row0 has isolated 1s, row2 has a large 2-blob with embedded 4s that seem adjacent to same-color areas, row20 has a sprawling 3-blob touching what looks like same-color 3s nearby without separation).
 * It appears to apply the same flawed sequential labeling, resulting in adjacent same-colors (e.g., multiple 1-blobs touching in rows 4-6 without differentiation; 4s in row22-29 form irregular shapes that likely conflict with neighbors like 3s in row18-20).
 * Patterns suggest over-merging or incorrect component boundaries (e.g., row9-16 have 2s and 4s intermingled in ways that don't form clean regions, unlike expected structured blobs in training); it misses the need for proper 4-coloring to avoid conflicts, leading to a noisy, non-map-like output.
 * To handle test case, must build an adjacency graph post-labeling and assign colors greedily (e.g., try 1-4 for each component, avoiding neighbors' colors); test seems to have more interlocking regions (e.g., 1s and 3s alternating but failing), so account for complex topologies.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based coloring puzzle (30x30) divided by a full separator line of 1's (horizontal row or vertical column) into a "legend" side (with pre-colored shapes indicating available colors) and a "picture" side (with outlines in various numbers and blank regions marked as 5's to be filled). The goal is to identify connected components of 5's on the picture side via flood fill and assign colors from the legend's unique colors (excluding 0 and 5), likely in a specific order such as cycling by component discovery or matching by shape/size/position, while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator must be a complete row or column entirely filled with 1's; prioritize horizontal search first, then vertical if none found—missing this leads to no separation and no filling.
 * Legend side extraction: Scan the designated legend area (e.g., above horizontal sep or right of vertical sep) row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to collect unique colors !=0 and !=5 in the order they first appear; this order seems critical for assignment, but simply cycling by discovery order fails as it mismatches expected color placements.
 * Picture side filling: Only fill connected components of 5's (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) using flood fill; components must be discovered in row-major order starting from the picture area (e.g., below horizontal sep or left of vertical sep); do not fill non-5 cells or cross boundaries.
 * Side orientation subtlety: For horizontal sep, legend is typically above (rows 0 to sep-1), picture below (rows sep+1 to end); for vertical sep, the code assumes legend right (cols sep+1 to end), picture left (cols 0 to sep-1), but this may be inverted in some cases (e.g., legend left, picture right), causing unfilled 5's or filling the wrong side—check which side has pre-colors vs. 5's.
 * Color assignment nuance: Not arbitrary cycling; expected outputs suggest assignment by component order (row-major discovery) but with legend colors in strict appearance order, or possibly matching components to legend shapes by size, position, or sequence—cycling works partially but leads to color swaps (e.g., 2 where 4 expected).
 * Grid boundaries: n=30 fixed; output starts as copy of input, only modify 5's in picture side; 0's are empty/background, other numbers are fixed outlines/colors—do not overwrite them.
 * Edge cases: No sep means return unchanged grid; empty legend (no colors) means no filling; multiple components may exceed legend colors, requiring cycling, but order matters; 5's may be isolated or large blobs; vertical seps may not stretch full height if code assumes they do.
 * Scanning order: All discovery (colors, components) must be consistent row-major to match expectations; stack-based flood fill is correct but ensure visited prevents overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Legend may have 5's (ignore them); components cannot cross sep (1's block); if sep not found or wrong side, 5's remain unfilled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_separator(n: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    # Finds horizontal (h) or vertical (v) full line of 1's; returns type and index, or None/-1
    sep_type = None
    sep_index = -1
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            sep_type = 'h'
            sep_index = r
            break
    if sep_type is None:
        for c in range(n):
            if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
                sep_type = 'v'
                sep_index = c
                break
    return sep_type, sep_index
```
(This works well for sep detection, as seen in partial matches in training outputs.)

```python
def extract_legend_colors(n: int, g: List[List[int]], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts unique non-0/non-5 colors from legend side in row-major order
    legend_colors = []
    seen = set()
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index):
            for c in range(n):
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index + 1, n):  # Assumes legend right; may need flip to range(sep_index)
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    return legend_colors
```
(This is helpful for color collection but may need side flip for vertical; order is key but simplistic uniqueness misses shape-based ordering.)

```python
def self_fill(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], color: int, sr: int, sc: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    # Stack-based flood fill for 5's only; marks visited and sets output to color
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This flood fill is correct and essential; prevents overfill and handles components accurately; directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)].)

```python
def color_picture_side(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], legend_colors: List[int], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> None:
    # Discovers and fills components in row-major order on picture side, cycling colors
    if not legend_colors:
        return
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component_id = 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index + 1, n):
            for c in range(n):
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index):  # Assumes picture left; may need flip to range(sep_index + 1, n)
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
```
(This is mostly helpful for component discovery but fails on color cycling/order and potential side flip; row-major scan is good.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly detects the horizontal separator in training example 1 (top legend intact, bottom filling attempted) and copies the input grid unchanged where appropriate, but fails to assign correct colors to components (e.g., uses [4,3,1,2] cycling, resulting in 2's where expected 4's in row 12 cols 12-13, 3's where 2's in row 20, and mismatches in rows 13-16/22-29; specific differences: generated row 12 has 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs. expected 4,4; row 13 has 2,2,2,2 at cols 9-12 vs. expected 4's shifted; row 17 has 3 at col 5 vs. expected nothing/0 there but 3's elsewhere).
 * For training example 2 (likely vertical sep), sep detection may succeed but side assignment is wrong (assumes legend right/picture left, but expected fills suggest legend left/picture right with 2's and 3's); many 5's remain unfilled (e.g., generated row 2 cols 14-23 are all 5's vs. expected 2's; row 4 cols 13-25 5's vs. expected 2's; row 9 cols 10-12 5's vs. expected 2's; row 20 cols 20-24 5's vs. expected 3's), and some left-side filling occurs incorrectly with 2,3,1 (e.g., row 1 cols 1-3 2's match but cols 19-20 5's unfilled vs. expected 2's).
 * Color cycling by component_id % len(legend_colors) works partially for small components but mismatches sequence (e.g., ex1 first bottom component gets 4 in generated but expected implies different start like 3 or shape-matching); unknown why exact order fails, possibly needs legend shape extraction/matching by size or position rather than scan order.
 * extract_legend_colors collects correctly for horizontal (e.g., ex1 gets [4,3,1,2]) but may collect from wrong side for vertical (ex2 legend likely left, leading to empty or wrong colors, causing no/minimal filling).
 * find_separator is reliable (no false negatives in outputs) but doesn't handle potential multiple seps or partial lines.
 * self_fill is accurate (no overfills or leaks in generated outputs) and essential for components.
 * Overall program structure (copy input, find sep, extract, fill) demonstrates core understanding but breaks on vertical orientation, color ordering, and possibly component-to-color mapping; no handling for no-sep case beyond return (but ex2 suggests sep exists); unhelpful: no shape/size matching function (needed?); visited is per-run only, correct but could miss global 5's if side wrong.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains most input numbers (e.g., 6's,4's,8's as outlines) but fails to fill 5's systematically, instead placing scattered 8's in legend/picture areas (e.g., row 1 cols 26-28 8's where likely blank/5 expected to fill; row 5 col 20 8's isolated vs. expected component fill; row 10 cols 16-21 8's but incomplete, leaving gaps like row 10 col 14 8 missing connections) and leaves many presumed 5's unfilled or mismatched (e.g., row 3 cols 13-19 partial 4's but 5's? implied unfilled; row 23 cols 5-30 heavy 8's but irregular, not matching clean components; overall, 8's appear overfilled or in wrong spots like row 0 cols 9-11, suggesting wrong legend extraction or side). This indicates sep detection succeeded (some structure preserved) but filling side/color assignment failed similarly to training (wrong vertical handling? mismatched colors like 8 overusing); does not match expected clean component fills—likely needs side flip for vertical and better color ordering to handle test's complex layout (multiple components, possible vertical sep).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 20:27:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual coloring puzzle where a grid contains pre-placed color samples (non-zero, non-5 values like 1,2,3,4,6,8 representing distinct colors), blank areas to color (5's forming connected components), and empty space (0's). The grid is implicitly divided by an invisible horizontal or vertical separator into a "legend" side (containing the unique color samples to use for filling) and a "picture" side (containing the 5's to fill via flood-fill on connected components, cycling through the legend's unique colors in the order they appear).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator is not explicitly marked; it must be inferred by evaluating possible horizontal (between rows) or vertical (between columns) cuts that best separate color samples (legend) from blanks (5's in picture), using a heuristic score like (colors on legend side * 5's on picture side) minus a penalty (k=100) for any 5's leaking into the legend side—higher score wins, and if both <0, do nothing.
 * Legend side is chosen as the side with more color samples (non-0, non-5 cells); if tie, the code assumes the side with more colors is legend, but this can fail if colors are unbalanced or if 5's are misclassified.
 * Unique legend colors are extracted in raster order (row-major, left-to-right, top-to-bottom) from the legend side only, deduplicated with a set to get a list like [1,2,3]—subtlety: order matters for cycling, and duplicates in legend shouldn't repeat in the cycle.
 * Picture side's 5's are filled via flood-fill (4-directional connectivity: up/down/left/right) on unvisited connected components, assigning colors from the legend list in sequence (cycle with % len(legend_colors)), starting a new component_id for each; subtlety: components must be fully connected groups of 5's only (not touching pre-colors or 0's), and filling replaces 5's but leaves pre-existing colors and 0's untouched.
 * If no valid separation (scores <0 or no legend colors), return the grid unchanged—easy to miss: this handles cases with no 5's or integrated legend/picture.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but separation index r/c is from 1 to n-1; vertical/horizontal choice prefers the higher score, with horizontal if tie.
 * Subtle edge cases: legend might not span full width/height; 5's might touch the separator or exist on both sides (penalized); pre-colors in picture side should remain (not overwritten); disconnected 5's get sequential colors, not random.
 * Overall: output must exactly match expected by replacing only 5's in picture with cycled legend colors per component, preserving all else—no filling outside picture, no color invention.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque  # Not used in code but could help for BFS flood-fill alternative to stack

# Helpful: Flood-fill function for connected 5's (current impl uses DFS stack; could switch to BFS for large components)
def self_fill(sr: int, sc: int, color: int, output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> None:
    stack = [(sr, sc)]  # DFS stack; deque for BFS if needed
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()  # For BFS: stack.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))

# Helpful: Extract unique legend colors in raster order (current impl is good but misses sorting/exact order)
def extract_legend_colors(legend_region: List[List[int]], seen: set = None) -> List[int]:
    if seen is None:
        seen = set()
    colors = []
    for row in legend_region:
        for val in row:
            if val != 0 and val != 5 and val not in seen:
                seen.add(val)
                colors.append(val)
    return colors

# Helpful: Score function for separation (current is solid but k=100 might need tuning; counts are O(n^2) but fine for small n)
def separation_score(legend_side_count: int, picture_fives: int, legend_fives: int, k: int = 100) -> int:
    return legend_side_count * picture_fives - k * legend_fives
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it demonstrates core understanding of separation heuristic, legend extraction, and flood-fill, but fails execution on both training examples due to misidentifying legend vs. picture sides or filling the wrong regions.
 * What worked: Separation scoring correctly identifies a potential cut (e.g., horizontal at row 5 in train1, as legend is row6 with all 1's); flood-fill correctly handles connectivity; preserves 0's and pre-colors; cycles colors via % len.
 * What didn't work: In train1, generated fills picture side (below row5) with 1,2,3,4 cycling, but expected has different colors/placements (e.g., row12 col12-13 has 4's in generated but 0's in expected; row13 has 4's where expected has nothing; row16 has 3's misplaced); this suggests wrong legend extraction (includes 4 from below?) or wrong picture range—unknown why, but likely legend_above logic fails as above_colors (rows0-4) has 1,2,3,4 but below has more, flipping sides incorrectly.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly fills upper areas with 1's and misplaces 2's/3's (e.g., row2 col14-23 has 1's but expected 2's; row8 col26-27 has 2's but expected 3's); picture filling leaks into legend or wrong sep_index (likely vertical, but left/right mischosen); component_id cycling starts wrong, overwriting pre-colors subtly.
 * extract_legend_colors (implicit in code) is helpful but broken here—adds colors from wrong side, including duplicates or post-sep leaks.
 * separation_score is helpful and core, but k=100 too aggressive, causing negative scores or wrong best_r/c in unbalanced grids.
 * self_fill is helpful and correct for connectivity, but applied to wrong regions (e.g., fills 5's in legend side accidentally).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but visited matrix init/clear per run could be optimized; no broken types.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills many 5's with 1's (e.g., scattered in cols24-29 across rows0-29, forming vertical strips), but leaves most 5's unfilled or untouched (e.g., large 5-clusters in rows8-16 cols0-23 remain 5's? Wait, output shows some 5's replaced but inconsistently—e.g., row8 col9-12 filled to 5? No, output has 5's persisting in picture areas like row10 col14-18, suggesting incomplete filling or wrong picture side.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulating): Input has pre-colors (1's in col9-11, 8's in left, 6's/4's right/bottom) and 5's scattered; expected should extract legend colors (likely 1,4,6,8 from one side, say left/top), then fill right/bottom 5-components cycling e.g., [1,4,6,8]—but generated over-relies on 1 (only cycles to it?), ignores 8/6/4 in filling, and fills vertically (suggests vertical sep chosen wrong, legend_left=true but left has few colors vs. right 5's); e.g., row2 col14-18 should be one component filled uniform color, but output has mixed/unfilled; bottom row28 has 5's unfilled where expected full color blobs. This mismatches as it doesn't cycle properly and likely picks wrong sep (vertical at low c, making left legend but left has 1's and 5's penalized heavily).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 20:27:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a puzzle involving the identification and 4-coloring (using values 1-4) of distinct connected regions (blobs or components) in a grid where cells with values >=5 represent "filled" or "land" areas, and 0 represents empty space. The goal is to assign colors to these regions such that no two adjacent regions (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-color theorem principles for map coloring, while preserving the original 0s and ensuring the output grid reflects properly separated and colored regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), based on cells >=5 being grouped into components via flood-fill or BFS/DFS.
 * Coloring must ensure adjacent regions (i.e., components that touch edge-to-edge) get different colors from {1,2,3,4}; sequential modulo-4 assignment fails because it doesn't check adjacency and can assign the same color to neighbors.
 * Preserve exact shapes of regions: output must match input connectivity for >=5 cells, replacing them with colors but keeping 0s unchanged; subtle patterns like stripes, isolated cells, or irregular blobs must be respected without merging or splitting.
 * Input grids likely have values >=5 as uniform "filled" (ignoring exact value beyond threshold), but outputs show structured patterns (e.g., horizontal/vertical stripes in top of train1, clustered blobs in lower areas), suggesting regions are predefined shapes that need proper separation.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components: each gets a unique color relative to its neighbors; global sequential labeling ignores graph structure (adjacency graph of components).
 * Empty rows/columns of 0s act as separators; do not color them.
 * Subtle: Some regions in expected outputs appear to be single cells or small groups (e.g., isolated 1s or 3s), while others are larger; the program over-labels large areas uniformly but fails on color conflicts.
 * Threshold >=5 is key for identifying filled cells; cells <5 (likely 0-4) stay as-is or are treated as empty, but in outputs, low numbers like 1-4 are colors, so inputs probably use high values only for filled.
 * Potential for odd-shaped adjacencies: regions can interlock or touch at edges without sharing cells, requiring adjacency check post-component extraction.
 * All training examples show patterned regions (e.g., train1 has cross-like or barred patterns in colors 1-4), implying the puzzle may involve recognizing or enforcing specific topologies like non-overlapping territories.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                min_r, min_c = i, j
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    size += 1
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] >= 5 and label[nx][ny] == 0:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            queue.append((nx, ny))

                next_label += 1
    return components, label  # Return components info and label grid for further use
```

    adj = [[] for _ in range(num_labels + 1)]

    # Remove duplicates
    for i in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies connected components using BFS flood-fill for cells >=5, which works for extracting region shapes (e.g., top rows in train1 match expected patterns for 4,3,1,2 regions).
 * However, it fails on coloring: assigns colors via (label-1) % 4 + 1, which is sequential and ignores adjacency, leading to same-color adjacent regions (e.g., in train1 lower sections, generated has mismatched 1,2,3,4 placements like row9 having 1s where expected has 4s, and row11 having 3s vs expected 1s; unknown why shapes differ slightly in lower blobs, possibly due to over-merging or incorrect labeling start).
 * Train1 generated matches expected exactly in rows 1-3 (patterned 4,3,1,2 stripes) and row5 (all 1s? wait, generated row5 all 0s but expected row5 all 0s, row6 all 1s matches), but diverges in rows 8+ (e.g., generated row9 has 0,0,0,2,2,2,0... with 1s misplaced; expected has 0s, then 4s in row8; generated incorrectly labels small blobs as continuing prior colors).
 * Train2 generated matches top rows partially (2,3,1 patterns), but mismatches in mid-sections (e.g., row2 has 1s where expected has 2s in a cluster; row10 has 3s where expected has 2s), and lower areas like row23 have scattered 3s/4s vs expected structured 3s.
 * No samples pass, indicating core issue is lack of graph coloring; sequential mod-4 is broken for adjacency conflicts.
 * The labeling function is helpful for extraction but insufficient alone; needs adjacency detection and greedy/backtracking coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the direct output assignment in the attempt (without saving components first) makes debugging hard; future attempts should separate extraction from coloring.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows fragmented and inconsistent coloring (e.g., row0 has isolated 1s, row2 has a large 2-blob with embedded 4s that seem adjacent to same-color areas, row20 has a sprawling 3-blob touching what looks like same-color 3s nearby without separation).
 * It appears to apply the same flawed sequential labeling, resulting in adjacent same-colors (e.g., multiple 1-blobs touching in rows 4-6 without differentiation; 4s in row22-29 form irregular shapes that likely conflict with neighbors like 3s in row18-20).
 * Patterns suggest over-merging or incorrect component boundaries (e.g., row9-16 have 2s and 4s intermingled in ways that don't form clean regions, unlike expected structured blobs in training); it misses the need for proper 4-coloring to avoid conflicts, leading to a noisy, non-map-like output.
 * To handle test case, must build an adjacency graph post-labeling and assign colors greedily (e.g., try 1-4 for each component, avoiding neighbors' colors); test seems to have more interlocking regions (e.g., 1s and 3s alternating but failing), so account for complex topologies.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based coloring puzzle (30x30) divided by a full separator line of 1's (horizontal row or vertical column) into a "legend" side (with pre-colored shapes indicating available colors) and a "picture" side (with outlines in various numbers and blank regions marked as 5's to be filled). The goal is to identify connected components of 5's on the picture side via flood fill and assign colors from the legend's unique colors (excluding 0 and 5), likely in a specific order such as cycling by component discovery or matching by shape/size/position, while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator must be a complete row or column entirely filled with 1's; prioritize horizontal search first, then vertical if none found—missing this leads to no separation and no filling.
 * Legend side extraction: Scan the designated legend area (e.g., above horizontal sep or right of vertical sep) row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to collect unique colors !=0 and !=5 in the order they first appear; this order seems critical for assignment, but simply cycling by discovery order fails as it mismatches expected color placements.
 * Picture side filling: Only fill connected components of 5's (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) using flood fill; components must be discovered in row-major order starting from the picture area (e.g., below horizontal sep or left of vertical sep); do not fill non-5 cells or cross boundaries.
 * Side orientation subtlety: For horizontal sep, legend is typically above (rows 0 to sep-1), picture below (rows sep+1 to end); for vertical sep, the code assumes legend right (cols sep+1 to end), picture left (cols 0 to sep-1), but this may be inverted in some cases (e.g., legend left, picture right), causing unfilled 5's or filling the wrong side—check which side has pre-colors vs. 5's.
 * Color assignment nuance: Not arbitrary cycling; expected outputs suggest assignment by component order (row-major discovery) but with legend colors in strict appearance order, or possibly matching components to legend shapes by size, position, or sequence—cycling works partially but leads to color swaps (e.g., 2 where 4 expected).
 * Grid boundaries: n=30 fixed; output starts as copy of input, only modify 5's in picture side; 0's are empty/background, other numbers are fixed outlines/colors—do not overwrite them.
 * Edge cases: No sep means return unchanged grid; empty legend (no colors) means no filling; multiple components may exceed legend colors, requiring cycling, but order matters; 5's may be isolated or large blobs; vertical seps may not stretch full height if code assumes they do.
 * Scanning order: All discovery (colors, components) must be consistent row-major to match expectations; stack-based flood fill is correct but ensure visited prevents overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Legend may have 5's (ignore them); components cannot cross sep (1's block); if sep not found or wrong side, 5's remain unfilled.

                break
    return sep_type, sep_index
```
(This works well for sep detection, as seen in partial matches in training outputs.)

```python
def extract_legend_colors(n: int, g: List[List[int]], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts unique non-0/non-5 colors from legend side in row-major order
    legend_colors = []
    seen = set()
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index):
            for c in range(n):
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index + 1, n):  # Assumes legend right; may need flip to range(sep_index)
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    return legend_colors
```
(This is helpful for color collection but may need side flip for vertical; order is key but simplistic uniqueness misses shape-based ordering.)

```python
def self_fill(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], color: int, sr: int, sc: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    # Stack-based flood fill for 5's only; marks visited and sets output to color
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This flood fill is correct and essential; prevents overfill and handles components accurately; directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)].)

```python
def color_picture_side(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], legend_colors: List[int], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> None:
    # Discovers and fills components in row-major order on picture side, cycling colors
    if not legend_colors:
        return
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component_id = 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index + 1, n):
            for c in range(n):
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index):  # Assumes picture left; may need flip to range(sep_index + 1, n)
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
```
(This is mostly helpful for component discovery but fails on color cycling/order and potential side flip; row-major scan is good.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly detects the horizontal separator in training example 1 (top legend intact, bottom filling attempted) and copies the input grid unchanged where appropriate, but fails to assign correct colors to components (e.g., uses [4,3,1,2] cycling, resulting in 2's where expected 4's in row 12 cols 12-13, 3's where 2's in row 20, and mismatches in rows 13-16/22-29; specific differences: generated row 12 has 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs. expected 4,4; row 13 has 2,2,2,2 at cols 9-12 vs. expected 4's shifted; row 17 has 3 at col 5 vs. expected nothing/0 there but 3's elsewhere).
 * For training example 2 (likely vertical sep), sep detection may succeed but side assignment is wrong (assumes legend right/picture left, but expected fills suggest legend left/picture right with 2's and 3's); many 5's remain unfilled (e.g., generated row 2 cols 14-23 are all 5's vs. expected 2's; row 4 cols 13-25 5's vs. expected 2's; row 9 cols 10-12 5's vs. expected 2's; row 20 cols 20-24 5's vs. expected 3's), and some left-side filling occurs incorrectly with 2,3,1 (e.g., row 1 cols 1-3 2's match but cols 19-20 5's unfilled vs. expected 2's).
 * Color cycling by component_id % len(legend_colors) works partially for small components but mismatches sequence (e.g., ex1 first bottom component gets 4 in generated but expected implies different start like 3 or shape-matching); unknown why exact order fails, possibly needs legend shape extraction/matching by size or position rather than scan order.
 * extract_legend_colors collects correctly for horizontal (e.g., ex1 gets [4,3,1,2]) but may collect from wrong side for vertical (ex2 legend likely left, leading to empty or wrong colors, causing no/minimal filling).
 * find_separator is reliable (no false negatives in outputs) but doesn't handle potential multiple seps or partial lines.
 * self_fill is accurate (no overfills or leaks in generated outputs) and essential for components.
 * Overall program structure (copy input, find sep, extract, fill) demonstrates core understanding but breaks on vertical orientation, color ordering, and possibly component-to-color mapping; no handling for no-sep case beyond return (but ex2 suggests sep exists); unhelpful: no shape/size matching function (needed?); visited is per-run only, correct but could miss global 5's if side wrong.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains most input numbers (e.g., 6's,4's,8's as outlines) but fails to fill 5's systematically, instead placing scattered 8's in legend/picture areas (e.g., row 1 cols 26-28 8's where likely blank/5 expected to fill; row 5 col 20 8's isolated vs. expected component fill; row 10 cols 16-21 8's but incomplete, leaving gaps like row 10 col 14 8 missing connections) and leaves many presumed 5's unfilled or mismatched (e.g., row 3 cols 13-19 partial 4's but 5's? implied unfilled; row 23 cols 5-30 heavy 8's but irregular, not matching clean components; overall, 8's appear overfilled or in wrong spots like row 0 cols 9-11, suggesting wrong legend extraction or side). This indicates sep detection succeeded (some structure preserved) but filling side/color assignment failed similarly to training (wrong vertical handling? mismatched colors like 8 overusing); does not match expected clean component fills—likely needs side flip for vertical and better color ordering to handle test's complex layout (multiple components, possible vertical sep).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual coloring puzzle where a grid contains pre-placed color samples (non-zero, non-5 values like 1,2,3,4,6,8 representing distinct colors), blank areas to color (5's forming connected components), and empty space (0's). The grid is implicitly divided by an invisible horizontal or vertical separator into a "legend" side (containing the unique color samples to use for filling) and a "picture" side (containing the 5's to fill via flood-fill on connected components, cycling through the legend's unique colors in the order they appear).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator is not explicitly marked; it must be inferred by evaluating possible horizontal (between rows) or vertical (between columns) cuts that best separate color samples (legend) from blanks (5's in picture), using a heuristic score like (colors on legend side * 5's on picture side) minus a penalty (k=100) for any 5's leaking into the legend side—higher score wins, and if both <0, do nothing.
 * Legend side is chosen as the side with more color samples (non-0, non-5 cells); if tie, the code assumes the side with more colors is legend, but this can fail if colors are unbalanced or if 5's are misclassified.
 * Unique legend colors are extracted in raster order (row-major, left-to-right, top-to-bottom) from the legend side only, deduplicated with a set to get a list like [1,2,3]—subtlety: order matters for cycling, and duplicates in legend shouldn't repeat in the cycle.
 * Picture side's 5's are filled via flood-fill (4-directional connectivity: up/down/left/right) on unvisited connected components, assigning colors from the legend list in sequence (cycle with % len(legend_colors)), starting a new component_id for each; subtlety: components must be fully connected groups of 5's only (not touching pre-colors or 0's), and filling replaces 5's but leaves pre-existing colors and 0's untouched.
 * If no valid separation (scores <0 or no legend colors), return the grid unchanged—easy to miss: this handles cases with no 5's or integrated legend/picture.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but separation index r/c is from 1 to n-1; vertical/horizontal choice prefers the higher score, with horizontal if tie.
 * Subtle edge cases: legend might not span full width/height; 5's might touch the separator or exist on both sides (penalized); pre-colors in picture side should remain (not overwritten); disconnected 5's get sequential colors, not random.
 * Overall: output must exactly match expected by replacing only 5's in picture with cycled legend colors per component, preserving all else—no filling outside picture, no color invention.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque  # Not used in code but could help for BFS flood-fill alternative to stack

# Helpful: Flood-fill function for connected 5's (current impl uses DFS stack; could switch to BFS for large components)
def self_fill(sr: int, sc: int, color: int, output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> None:
    stack = [(sr, sc)]  # DFS stack; deque for BFS if needed
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()  # For BFS: stack.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))

# Helpful: Extract unique legend colors in raster order (current impl is good but misses sorting/exact order)
def extract_legend_colors(legend_region: List[List[int]], seen: set = None) -> List[int]:
    if seen is None:
        seen = set()
    colors = []
    for row in legend_region:
        for val in row:
            if val != 0 and val != 5 and val not in seen:
                seen.add(val)
                colors.append(val)
    return colors

# Helpful: Score function for separation (current is solid but k=100 might need tuning; counts are O(n^2) but fine for small n)
def separation_score(legend_side_count: int, picture_fives: int, legend_fives: int, k: int = 100) -> int:
    return legend_side_count * picture_fives - k * legend_fives
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it demonstrates core understanding of separation heuristic, legend extraction, and flood-fill, but fails execution on both training examples due to misidentifying legend vs. picture sides or filling the wrong regions.
 * What worked: Separation scoring correctly identifies a potential cut (e.g., horizontal at row 5 in train1, as legend is row6 with all 1's); flood-fill correctly handles connectivity; preserves 0's and pre-colors; cycles colors via % len.
 * What didn't work: In train1, generated fills picture side (below row5) with 1,2,3,4 cycling, but expected has different colors/placements (e.g., row12 col12-13 has 4's in generated but 0's in expected; row13 has 4's where expected has nothing; row16 has 3's misplaced); this suggests wrong legend extraction (includes 4 from below?) or wrong picture range—unknown why, but likely legend_above logic fails as above_colors (rows0-4) has 1,2,3,4 but below has more, flipping sides incorrectly.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly fills upper areas with 1's and misplaces 2's/3's (e.g., row2 col14-23 has 1's but expected 2's; row8 col26-27 has 2's but expected 3's); picture filling leaks into legend or wrong sep_index (likely vertical, but left/right mischosen); component_id cycling starts wrong, overwriting pre-colors subtly.
 * extract_legend_colors (implicit in code) is helpful but broken here—adds colors from wrong side, including duplicates or post-sep leaks.
 * separation_score is helpful and core, but k=100 too aggressive, causing negative scores or wrong best_r/c in unbalanced grids.
 * self_fill is helpful and correct for connectivity, but applied to wrong regions (e.g., fills 5's in legend side accidentally).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but visited matrix init/clear per run could be optimized; no broken types.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills many 5's with 1's (e.g., scattered in cols24-29 across rows0-29, forming vertical strips), but leaves most 5's unfilled or untouched (e.g., large 5-clusters in rows8-16 cols0-23 remain 5's? Wait, output shows some 5's replaced but inconsistently—e.g., row8 col9-12 filled to 5? No, output has 5's persisting in picture areas like row10 col14-18, suggesting incomplete filling or wrong picture side.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulating): Input has pre-colors (1's in col9-11, 8's in left, 6's/4's right/bottom) and 5's scattered; expected should extract legend colors (likely 1,4,6,8 from one side, say left/top), then fill right/bottom 5-components cycling e.g., [1,4,6,8]—but generated over-relies on 1 (only cycles to it?), ignores 8/6/4 in filling, and fills vertically (suggests vertical sep chosen wrong, legend_left=true but left has few colors vs. right 5's); e.g., row2 col14-18 should be one component filled uniform color, but output has mixed/unfilled; bottom row28 has 5's unfilled where expected full color blobs. This mismatches as it doesn't cycle properly and likely picks wrong sep (vertical at low c, making left legend but left has 1's and 5's penalized heavily).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 20:32:25] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where connected components of cells valued at 5 (likely representing uncolored "blobs" or regions) must be identified and recolored with integers 1-4 such that no two adjacent components (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-connectivity rules; the rest of the grid (non-5 cells) remains unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid matching this coloring scheme, possibly with a preference for higher colors (e.g., starting assignments from 4 downward) to match specific expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and only cells with exactly 5 are considered for component extraction—other values like 0,1,2,3,4,6,8 must be preserved as-is in the output.
 * Adjacency for coloring is also 4-directional and only between different components (i.e., if two 5-cells from different components touch, their colors must differ; same-component cells get the same color).
 * Coloring is greedy but order-sensitive: the current implementation assigns colors starting from the highest (4 down to 1) based on forbidden colors from already-colored neighbors, but this order-of-discovery (row-major scanning) leads to mismatches—expected outputs suggest a need for a different traversal order, canonical labeling (e.g., by size, position, or min coordinates), or possibly a full graph coloring algorithm that minimizes colors or follows a specific priority.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous or nested/irregularly shaped, and small isolated components (size 1+) must be handled; the min_r/min_c in components tracking seems intended for sorting/ordering but isn't used effectively for coloring decisions.
 * Preserve all non-5 values exactly (e.g., input 1s stay 1, 8s stay 8); the output should never introduce values outside 1-4 for former 5s or alter existing numbers.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no 5s should return unchanged; large components spanning the grid; potential for 4+ colors needed but since graph is planar-ish, 4 should suffice.
 * The puzzle likely simulates "region coloring" like in maps or Nonogram-style puzzles, where visual separation (no same-color adjacencies) is key—mismatches often occur in complex interlocked regions where greedy fails to match expected "minimal" or "preferred" colorings.
 * Important: Labeling must be unique per component (next_label increments correctly), and adjacency building removes duplicates, but the coloring loop processes labels in discovery order (1 to num_labels), which may not align with expected color priorities (e.g., larger components or top-left first might need precedence).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for preserving the input grid while modifying only 5s.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]], List[List[int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return [], [[0]]
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    label = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    next_label = 1
    components = []
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 5 and label[i][j] == 0:
                size = 0
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                min_r, min_c = i, j
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    size += 1
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] == 5 and label[nx][ny] == 0:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, min_r, min_c, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components, label
```
(This BFS-based component finder with labeling and min position/size tracking is solid and correctly identifies 4-connected 5-components; it's essential for extraction and could be extended by sorting components e.g., by (min_r, min_c) for consistent ordering.)

```python
def build_adjacency(label: List[List[int]], num_labels: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(label), len(label[0])
    adj = [[] for _ in range(num_labels + 1)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if label[i][j] > 0:
                l = label[i][j]
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and label[ni][nj] > 0 and label[ni][nj] != l:
                        adj[l].append(label[ni][nj])
    for i in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```
(This builds an undirected graph of component adjacencies correctly by scanning labeled grid edges and deduplicating neighbors; very helpful for modeling the coloring constraint graph.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, which correctly implements connected component labeling via BFS and builds an adjacency graph, but fails in the greedy coloring step due to processing labels in discovery order (leading to suboptimal or mismatched color assignments compared to expected).
 * What worked: Component extraction accurately identifies and labels separate 5-regions (e.g., in training 1, the top 1/2/3/4 blobs are split correctly); adjacency detection catches edge-sharing between components; grid copying preserves non-5s.
 * What didn't work: The assign_colors function uses a simple greedy approach (highest available color 4-to-1) in label order, but expected outputs use different assignments—e.g., in training 1, generated uses all 4 for a large bottom-left blob where expected splits it into 3 and 1; in training 2, generated merges or miscolors a sprawling 2-region into 4s. This suggests the need to sort components (e.g., by size descending or position) before coloring, or use a different strategy like smallest degree last or exact matching to expected priorities.
 * In training 1: Generated mismatches in rows 9-29, e.g., row 9 has 4,4,4 where expected has 3,3,3; row 11 has 4s where expected has 1s; row 14 has scattered 4s/1s differently; unknown why, but likely due to coloring order causing a chain reaction in interlocked regions.
 * In training 2: Mismatches in rows 1-29, e.g., row 1 has 4,4 where expected has 2,2; row 8 has 4s where expected has 2s; row 9 has 2s where expected has 3s; again, greedy order fails on complex topologies.
 * The main program ties it together well but doesn't sort components or adjust coloring for expected patterns—min_r/min_c/size are computed but unused beyond appending.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (copy_grid, find_components, build_adjacency, assign_colors) are relevant, though assign_colors needs fixing (e.g., sort labels by component size or position before coloring loop).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it introduces or preserves values like 8 and 6 (e.g., in rows 1-6 and 7-16), which are likely from the input grid and unchanged (correct behavior), but the coloring of 5s results in 1 and 4 mostly, with patterns that seem arbitrary (e.g., a large 4-blob in rows 2-6 cols 1-8, isolated 1s in col 24); however, without the expected test output, it's hard to confirm, but it doesn't match the structured 1-4 colorings in training expecteds and includes 8/6 which may indicate the input has pre-colored elements that interact poorly.
 * Issues: Scattered 1s in col 24 across many rows suggest small components colored low, but expected might group them differently; the 4-heavy upper left doesn't align with training expecteds' balanced use of 1-3; potential over-reliance on discovery order causes inconsistent coloring (e.g., why col 26-28 get 8s—probably input, but if 5s there, coloring failed); overall, it looks like partial component detection but wrong color propagation, similar to training failures—does not make sense as a valid 4-coloring without verifying adjacencies mentally (e.g., adjacent 4s from different components would violate rules).
 * To handle test: Ensure coloring accounts for pre-existing colors? No, program ignores them for forbidden sets, which might be wrong if puzzle treats all non-0 as "colored" already; also, sort components by (min_r, min_c) or size to match expected order.

[2025-10-03 20:32:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a puzzle involving the identification and 4-coloring (using values 1-4) of distinct connected regions (blobs or components) in a grid where cells with values >=5 represent "filled" or "land" areas, and 0 represents empty space. The goal is to assign colors to these regions such that no two adjacent regions (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-color theorem principles for map coloring, while preserving the original 0s and ensuring the output grid reflects properly separated and colored regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), based on cells >=5 being grouped into components via flood-fill or BFS/DFS.
 * Coloring must ensure adjacent regions (i.e., components that touch edge-to-edge) get different colors from {1,2,3,4}; sequential modulo-4 assignment fails because it doesn't check adjacency and can assign the same color to neighbors.
 * Preserve exact shapes of regions: output must match input connectivity for >=5 cells, replacing them with colors but keeping 0s unchanged; subtle patterns like stripes, isolated cells, or irregular blobs must be respected without merging or splitting.
 * Input grids likely have values >=5 as uniform "filled" (ignoring exact value beyond threshold), but outputs show structured patterns (e.g., horizontal/vertical stripes in top of train1, clustered blobs in lower areas), suggesting regions are predefined shapes that need proper separation.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components: each gets a unique color relative to its neighbors; global sequential labeling ignores graph structure (adjacency graph of components).
 * Empty rows/columns of 0s act as separators; do not color them.
 * Subtle: Some regions in expected outputs appear to be single cells or small groups (e.g., isolated 1s or 3s), while others are larger; the program over-labels large areas uniformly but fails on color conflicts.
 * Threshold >=5 is key for identifying filled cells; cells <5 (likely 0-4) stay as-is or are treated as empty, but in outputs, low numbers like 1-4 are colors, so inputs probably use high values only for filled.
 * Potential for odd-shaped adjacencies: regions can interlock or touch at edges without sharing cells, requiring adjacency check post-component extraction.
 * All training examples show patterned regions (e.g., train1 has cross-like or barred patterns in colors 1-4), implying the puzzle may involve recognizing or enforcing specific topologies like non-overlapping territories.

                next_label += 1
    return components, label  # Return components info and label grid for further use

    # Remove duplicates
    for i in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies connected components using BFS flood-fill for cells >=5, which works for extracting region shapes (e.g., top rows in train1 match expected patterns for 4,3,1,2 regions).
 * However, it fails on coloring: assigns colors via (label-1) % 4 + 1, which is sequential and ignores adjacency, leading to same-color adjacent regions (e.g., in train1 lower sections, generated has mismatched 1,2,3,4 placements like row9 having 1s where expected has 4s, and row11 having 3s vs expected 1s; unknown why shapes differ slightly in lower blobs, possibly due to over-merging or incorrect labeling start).
 * Train1 generated matches expected exactly in rows 1-3 (patterned 4,3,1,2 stripes) and row5 (all 1s? wait, generated row5 all 0s but expected row5 all 0s, row6 all 1s matches), but diverges in rows 8+ (e.g., generated row9 has 0,0,0,2,2,2,0... with 1s misplaced; expected has 0s, then 4s in row8; generated incorrectly labels small blobs as continuing prior colors).
 * Train2 generated matches top rows partially (2,3,1 patterns), but mismatches in mid-sections (e.g., row2 has 1s where expected has 2s in a cluster; row10 has 3s where expected has 2s), and lower areas like row23 have scattered 3s/4s vs expected structured 3s.
 * No samples pass, indicating core issue is lack of graph coloring; sequential mod-4 is broken for adjacency conflicts.
 * The labeling function is helpful for extraction but insufficient alone; needs adjacency detection and greedy/backtracking coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the direct output assignment in the attempt (without saving components first) makes debugging hard; future attempts should separate extraction from coloring.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows fragmented and inconsistent coloring (e.g., row0 has isolated 1s, row2 has a large 2-blob with embedded 4s that seem adjacent to same-color areas, row20 has a sprawling 3-blob touching what looks like same-color 3s nearby without separation).
 * It appears to apply the same flawed sequential labeling, resulting in adjacent same-colors (e.g., multiple 1-blobs touching in rows 4-6 without differentiation; 4s in row22-29 form irregular shapes that likely conflict with neighbors like 3s in row18-20).
 * Patterns suggest over-merging or incorrect component boundaries (e.g., row9-16 have 2s and 4s intermingled in ways that don't form clean regions, unlike expected structured blobs in training); it misses the need for proper 4-coloring to avoid conflicts, leading to a noisy, non-map-like output.
 * To handle test case, must build an adjacency graph post-labeling and assign colors greedily (e.g., try 1-4 for each component, avoiding neighbors' colors); test seems to have more interlocking regions (e.g., 1s and 3s alternating but failing), so account for complex topologies.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based coloring puzzle (30x30) divided by a full separator line of 1's (horizontal row or vertical column) into a "legend" side (with pre-colored shapes indicating available colors) and a "picture" side (with outlines in various numbers and blank regions marked as 5's to be filled). The goal is to identify connected components of 5's on the picture side via flood fill and assign colors from the legend's unique colors (excluding 0 and 5), likely in a specific order such as cycling by component discovery or matching by shape/size/position, while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator must be a complete row or column entirely filled with 1's; prioritize horizontal search first, then vertical if none found—missing this leads to no separation and no filling.
 * Legend side extraction: Scan the designated legend area (e.g., above horizontal sep or right of vertical sep) row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to collect unique colors !=0 and !=5 in the order they first appear; this order seems critical for assignment, but simply cycling by discovery order fails as it mismatches expected color placements.
 * Picture side filling: Only fill connected components of 5's (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) using flood fill; components must be discovered in row-major order starting from the picture area (e.g., below horizontal sep or left of vertical sep); do not fill non-5 cells or cross boundaries.
 * Side orientation subtlety: For horizontal sep, legend is typically above (rows 0 to sep-1), picture below (rows sep+1 to end); for vertical sep, the code assumes legend right (cols sep+1 to end), picture left (cols 0 to sep-1), but this may be inverted in some cases (e.g., legend left, picture right), causing unfilled 5's or filling the wrong side—check which side has pre-colors vs. 5's.
 * Color assignment nuance: Not arbitrary cycling; expected outputs suggest assignment by component order (row-major discovery) but with legend colors in strict appearance order, or possibly matching components to legend shapes by size, position, or sequence—cycling works partially but leads to color swaps (e.g., 2 where 4 expected).
 * Grid boundaries: n=30 fixed; output starts as copy of input, only modify 5's in picture side; 0's are empty/background, other numbers are fixed outlines/colors—do not overwrite them.
 * Edge cases: No sep means return unchanged grid; empty legend (no colors) means no filling; multiple components may exceed legend colors, requiring cycling, but order matters; 5's may be isolated or large blobs; vertical seps may not stretch full height if code assumes they do.
 * Scanning order: All discovery (colors, components) must be consistent row-major to match expectations; stack-based flood fill is correct but ensure visited prevents overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Legend may have 5's (ignore them); components cannot cross sep (1's block); if sep not found or wrong side, 5's remain unfilled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_separator(n: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    # Finds horizontal (h) or vertical (v) full line of 1's; returns type and index, or None/-1
    sep_type = None
    sep_index = -1
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            sep_type = 'h'
            sep_index = r
            break
    if sep_type is None:
        for c in range(n):
            if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
                sep_type = 'v'
                sep_index = c
                break
    return sep_type, sep_index
```
(This works well for sep detection, as seen in partial matches in training outputs.)

```python
def extract_legend_colors(n: int, g: List[List[int]], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts unique non-0/non-5 colors from legend side in row-major order
    legend_colors = []
    seen = set()
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index):
            for c in range(n):
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index + 1, n):  # Assumes legend right; may need flip to range(sep_index)
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    return legend_colors
```
(This is helpful for color collection but may need side flip for vertical; order is key but simplistic uniqueness misses shape-based ordering.)

```python
def self_fill(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], color: int, sr: int, sc: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    # Stack-based flood fill for 5's only; marks visited and sets output to color
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This flood fill is correct and essential; prevents overfill and handles components accurately; directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)].)

(This is mostly helpful for component discovery but fails on color cycling/order and potential side flip; row-major scan is good.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly detects the horizontal separator in training example 1 (top legend intact, bottom filling attempted) and copies the input grid unchanged where appropriate, but fails to assign correct colors to components (e.g., uses [4,3,1,2] cycling, resulting in 2's where expected 4's in row 12 cols 12-13, 3's where 2's in row 20, and mismatches in rows 13-16/22-29; specific differences: generated row 12 has 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs. expected 4,4; row 13 has 2,2,2,2 at cols 9-12 vs. expected 4's shifted; row 17 has 3 at col 5 vs. expected nothing/0 there but 3's elsewhere).
 * For training example 2 (likely vertical sep), sep detection may succeed but side assignment is wrong (assumes legend right/picture left, but expected fills suggest legend left/picture right with 2's and 3's); many 5's remain unfilled (e.g., generated row 2 cols 14-23 are all 5's vs. expected 2's; row 4 cols 13-25 5's vs. expected 2's; row 9 cols 10-12 5's vs. expected 2's; row 20 cols 20-24 5's vs. expected 3's), and some left-side filling occurs incorrectly with 2,3,1 (e.g., row 1 cols 1-3 2's match but cols 19-20 5's unfilled vs. expected 2's).
 * Color cycling by component_id % len(legend_colors) works partially for small components but mismatches sequence (e.g., ex1 first bottom component gets 4 in generated but expected implies different start like 3 or shape-matching); unknown why exact order fails, possibly needs legend shape extraction/matching by size or position rather than scan order.
 * extract_legend_colors collects correctly for horizontal (e.g., ex1 gets [4,3,1,2]) but may collect from wrong side for vertical (ex2 legend likely left, leading to empty or wrong colors, causing no/minimal filling).
 * find_separator is reliable (no false negatives in outputs) but doesn't handle potential multiple seps or partial lines.
 * self_fill is accurate (no overfills or leaks in generated outputs) and essential for components.
 * Overall program structure (copy input, find sep, extract, fill) demonstrates core understanding but breaks on vertical orientation, color ordering, and possibly component-to-color mapping; no handling for no-sep case beyond return (but ex2 suggests sep exists); unhelpful: no shape/size matching function (needed?); visited is per-run only, correct but could miss global 5's if side wrong.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains most input numbers (e.g., 6's,4's,8's as outlines) but fails to fill 5's systematically, instead placing scattered 8's in legend/picture areas (e.g., row 1 cols 26-28 8's where likely blank/5 expected to fill; row 5 col 20 8's isolated vs. expected component fill; row 10 cols 16-21 8's but incomplete, leaving gaps like row 10 col 14 8 missing connections) and leaves many presumed 5's unfilled or mismatched (e.g., row 3 cols 13-19 partial 4's but 5's? implied unfilled; row 23 cols 5-30 heavy 8's but irregular, not matching clean components; overall, 8's appear overfilled or in wrong spots like row 0 cols 9-11, suggesting wrong legend extraction or side). This indicates sep detection succeeded (some structure preserved) but filling side/color assignment failed similarly to training (wrong vertical handling? mismatched colors like 8 overusing); does not match expected clean component fills—likely needs side flip for vertical and better color ordering to handle test's complex layout (multiple components, possible vertical sep).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual coloring puzzle where a grid contains pre-placed color samples (non-zero, non-5 values like 1,2,3,4,6,8 representing distinct colors), blank areas to color (5's forming connected components), and empty space (0's). The grid is implicitly divided by an invisible horizontal or vertical separator into a "legend" side (containing the unique color samples to use for filling) and a "picture" side (containing the 5's to fill via flood-fill on connected components, cycling through the legend's unique colors in the order they appear).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator is not explicitly marked; it must be inferred by evaluating possible horizontal (between rows) or vertical (between columns) cuts that best separate color samples (legend) from blanks (5's in picture), using a heuristic score like (colors on legend side * 5's on picture side) minus a penalty (k=100) for any 5's leaking into the legend side—higher score wins, and if both <0, do nothing.
 * Legend side is chosen as the side with more color samples (non-0, non-5 cells); if tie, the code assumes the side with more colors is legend, but this can fail if colors are unbalanced or if 5's are misclassified.
 * Unique legend colors are extracted in raster order (row-major, left-to-right, top-to-bottom) from the legend side only, deduplicated with a set to get a list like [1,2,3]—subtlety: order matters for cycling, and duplicates in legend shouldn't repeat in the cycle.
 * Picture side's 5's are filled via flood-fill (4-directional connectivity: up/down/left/right) on unvisited connected components, assigning colors from the legend list in sequence (cycle with % len(legend_colors)), starting a new component_id for each; subtlety: components must be fully connected groups of 5's only (not touching pre-colors or 0's), and filling replaces 5's but leaves pre-existing colors and 0's untouched.
 * If no valid separation (scores <0 or no legend colors), return the grid unchanged—easy to miss: this handles cases with no 5's or integrated legend/picture.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but separation index r/c is from 1 to n-1; vertical/horizontal choice prefers the higher score, with horizontal if tie.
 * Subtle edge cases: legend might not span full width/height; 5's might touch the separator or exist on both sides (penalized); pre-colors in picture side should remain (not overwritten); disconnected 5's get sequential colors, not random.
 * Overall: output must exactly match expected by replacing only 5's in picture with cycled legend colors per component, preserving all else—no filling outside picture, no color invention.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque  # Not used in code but could help for BFS flood-fill alternative to stack

# Helpful: Flood-fill function for connected 5's (current impl uses DFS stack; could switch to BFS for large components)
def self_fill(sr: int, sc: int, color: int, output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> None:
    stack = [(sr, sc)]  # DFS stack; deque for BFS if needed
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()  # For BFS: stack.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))

# Helpful: Extract unique legend colors in raster order (current impl is good but misses sorting/exact order)
def extract_legend_colors(legend_region: List[List[int]], seen: set = None) -> List[int]:
    if seen is None:
        seen = set()
    colors = []
    for row in legend_region:
        for val in row:
            if val != 0 and val != 5 and val not in seen:
                seen.add(val)
                colors.append(val)
    return colors

# Helpful: Score function for separation (current is solid but k=100 might need tuning; counts are O(n^2) but fine for small n)
def separation_score(legend_side_count: int, picture_fives: int, legend_fives: int, k: int = 100) -> int:
    return legend_side_count * picture_fives - k * legend_fives
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it demonstrates core understanding of separation heuristic, legend extraction, and flood-fill, but fails execution on both training examples due to misidentifying legend vs. picture sides or filling the wrong regions.
 * What worked: Separation scoring correctly identifies a potential cut (e.g., horizontal at row 5 in train1, as legend is row6 with all 1's); flood-fill correctly handles connectivity; preserves 0's and pre-colors; cycles colors via % len.
 * What didn't work: In train1, generated fills picture side (below row5) with 1,2,3,4 cycling, but expected has different colors/placements (e.g., row12 col12-13 has 4's in generated but 0's in expected; row13 has 4's where expected has nothing; row16 has 3's misplaced); this suggests wrong legend extraction (includes 4 from below?) or wrong picture range—unknown why, but likely legend_above logic fails as above_colors (rows0-4) has 1,2,3,4 but below has more, flipping sides incorrectly.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly fills upper areas with 1's and misplaces 2's/3's (e.g., row2 col14-23 has 1's but expected 2's; row8 col26-27 has 2's but expected 3's); picture filling leaks into legend or wrong sep_index (likely vertical, but left/right mischosen); component_id cycling starts wrong, overwriting pre-colors subtly.
 * extract_legend_colors (implicit in code) is helpful but broken here—adds colors from wrong side, including duplicates or post-sep leaks.
 * separation_score is helpful and core, but k=100 too aggressive, causing negative scores or wrong best_r/c in unbalanced grids.
 * self_fill is helpful and correct for connectivity, but applied to wrong regions (e.g., fills 5's in legend side accidentally).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but visited matrix init/clear per run could be optimized; no broken types.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills many 5's with 1's (e.g., scattered in cols24-29 across rows0-29, forming vertical strips), but leaves most 5's unfilled or untouched (e.g., large 5-clusters in rows8-16 cols0-23 remain 5's? Wait, output shows some 5's replaced but inconsistently—e.g., row8 col9-12 filled to 5? No, output has 5's persisting in picture areas like row10 col14-18, suggesting incomplete filling or wrong picture side.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulating): Input has pre-colors (1's in col9-11, 8's in left, 6's/4's right/bottom) and 5's scattered; expected should extract legend colors (likely 1,4,6,8 from one side, say left/top), then fill right/bottom 5-components cycling e.g., [1,4,6,8]—but generated over-relies on 1 (only cycles to it?), ignores 8/6/4 in filling, and fills vertically (suggests vertical sep chosen wrong, legend_left=true but left has few colors vs. right 5's); e.g., row2 col14-18 should be one component filled uniform color, but output has mixed/unfilled; bottom row28 has 5's unfilled where expected full color blobs. This mismatches as it doesn't cycle properly and likely picks wrong sep (vertical at low c, making left legend but left has 1's and 5's penalized heavily).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where connected components of cells valued at 5 (likely representing uncolored "blobs" or regions) must be identified and recolored with integers 1-4 such that no two adjacent components (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-connectivity rules; the rest of the grid (non-5 cells) remains unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid matching this coloring scheme, possibly with a preference for higher colors (e.g., starting assignments from 4 downward) to match specific expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and only cells with exactly 5 are considered for component extraction—other values like 0,1,2,3,4,6,8 must be preserved as-is in the output.
 * Adjacency for coloring is also 4-directional and only between different components (i.e., if two 5-cells from different components touch, their colors must differ; same-component cells get the same color).
 * Coloring is greedy but order-sensitive: the current implementation assigns colors starting from the highest (4 down to 1) based on forbidden colors from already-colored neighbors, but this order-of-discovery (row-major scanning) leads to mismatches—expected outputs suggest a need for a different traversal order, canonical labeling (e.g., by size, position, or min coordinates), or possibly a full graph coloring algorithm that minimizes colors or follows a specific priority.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous or nested/irregularly shaped, and small isolated components (size 1+) must be handled; the min_r/min_c in components tracking seems intended for sorting/ordering but isn't used effectively for coloring decisions.
 * Preserve all non-5 values exactly (e.g., input 1s stay 1, 8s stay 8); the output should never introduce values outside 1-4 for former 5s or alter existing numbers.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no 5s should return unchanged; large components spanning the grid; potential for 4+ colors needed but since graph is planar-ish, 4 should suffice.
 * The puzzle likely simulates "region coloring" like in maps or Nonogram-style puzzles, where visual separation (no same-color adjacencies) is key—mismatches often occur in complex interlocked regions where greedy fails to match expected "minimal" or "preferred" colorings.
 * Important: Labeling must be unique per component (next_label increments correctly), and adjacency building removes duplicates, but the coloring loop processes labels in discovery order (1 to num_labels), which may not align with expected color priorities (e.g., larger components or top-left first might need precedence).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for preserving the input grid while modifying only 5s.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]], List[List[int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return [], [[0]]
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    label = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    next_label = 1
    components = []
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 5 and label[i][j] == 0:
                size = 0
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                min_r, min_c = i, j
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    size += 1
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] == 5 and label[nx][ny] == 0:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, min_r, min_c, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components, label
```
(This BFS-based component finder with labeling and min position/size tracking is solid and correctly identifies 4-connected 5-components; it's essential for extraction and could be extended by sorting components e.g., by (min_r, min_c) for consistent ordering.)

```python
def build_adjacency(label: List[List[int]], num_labels: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(label), len(label[0])
    adj = [[] for _ in range(num_labels + 1)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if label[i][j] > 0:
                l = label[i][j]
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and label[ni][nj] > 0 and label[ni][nj] != l:
                        adj[l].append(label[ni][nj])
    for i in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```
(This builds an undirected graph of component adjacencies correctly by scanning labeled grid edges and deduplicating neighbors; very helpful for modeling the coloring constraint graph.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, which correctly implements connected component labeling via BFS and builds an adjacency graph, but fails in the greedy coloring step due to processing labels in discovery order (leading to suboptimal or mismatched color assignments compared to expected).
 * What worked: Component extraction accurately identifies and labels separate 5-regions (e.g., in training 1, the top 1/2/3/4 blobs are split correctly); adjacency detection catches edge-sharing between components; grid copying preserves non-5s.
 * What didn't work: The assign_colors function uses a simple greedy approach (highest available color 4-to-1) in label order, but expected outputs use different assignments—e.g., in training 1, generated uses all 4 for a large bottom-left blob where expected splits it into 3 and 1; in training 2, generated merges or miscolors a sprawling 2-region into 4s. This suggests the need to sort components (e.g., by size descending or position) before coloring, or use a different strategy like smallest degree last or exact matching to expected priorities.
 * In training 1: Generated mismatches in rows 9-29, e.g., row 9 has 4,4,4 where expected has 3,3,3; row 11 has 4s where expected has 1s; row 14 has scattered 4s/1s differently; unknown why, but likely due to coloring order causing a chain reaction in interlocked regions.
 * In training 2: Mismatches in rows 1-29, e.g., row 1 has 4,4 where expected has 2,2; row 8 has 4s where expected has 2s; row 9 has 2s where expected has 3s; again, greedy order fails on complex topologies.
 * The main program ties it together well but doesn't sort components or adjust coloring for expected patterns—min_r/min_c/size are computed but unused beyond appending.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (copy_grid, find_components, build_adjacency, assign_colors) are relevant, though assign_colors needs fixing (e.g., sort labels by component size or position before coloring loop).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it introduces or preserves values like 8 and 6 (e.g., in rows 1-6 and 7-16), which are likely from the input grid and unchanged (correct behavior), but the coloring of 5s results in 1 and 4 mostly, with patterns that seem arbitrary (e.g., a large 4-blob in rows 2-6 cols 1-8, isolated 1s in col 24); however, without the expected test output, it's hard to confirm, but it doesn't match the structured 1-4 colorings in training expecteds and includes 8/6 which may indicate the input has pre-colored elements that interact poorly.
 * Issues: Scattered 1s in col 24 across many rows suggest small components colored low, but expected might group them differently; the 4-heavy upper left doesn't align with training expecteds' balanced use of 1-3; potential over-reliance on discovery order causes inconsistent coloring (e.g., why col 26-28 get 8s—probably input, but if 5s there, coloring failed); overall, it looks like partial component detection but wrong color propagation, similar to training failures—does not make sense as a valid 4-coloring without verifying adjacencies mentally (e.g., adjacent 4s from different components would violate rules).
 * To handle test: Ensure coloring accounts for pre-existing colors? No, program ignores them for forbidden sets, which might be wrong if puzzle treats all non-0 as "colored" already; also, sort components by (min_r, min_c) or size to match expected order.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 20:35:32] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid that represents a visual diagram with a legend of colored shapes (non-zero numbers excluding 5's and possibly background 1's), a separator line (full row or column of 1's dividing legend from picture), and a picture area containing blanks (5's) to be filled. The goal is to fill the 5's in the picture area by assigning colors from the legend's unique shapes/components in a specific order (likely discovery or positional), while preserving the original legend and separator, but the current program incorrectly cycles through legend colors for each connected component of 5's without matching shapes or sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 0 for empty/background, 1 for separators or background components (largest 1-component should be excluded from legend to avoid including the separator itself), 5 for blanks to fill in the picture area, and other numbers (2-8+) for pre-colored shapes in the legend.
 * Separators are full rows ('h') or columns ('v') entirely of 1's; if vertical, determine picture side by comparing number of 5's on left vs. right (picture on side with more or equal 5's).
 * Legend colors are derived from unique colors of connected components (4-directional adjacency, excluding 0,1,5) in discovery order (row-major), skipping the largest 1-component (likely the separator or background).
 * Filling only occurs in the "picture" region (post-separator, respecting side for vertical); non-picture 5's (if any) should remain 5 or be unchanged, but current code assumes all 5's are in picture.
 * Connected components of 5's in the picture should be filled entirely with one color, but assignment must match legend shapes by size/order/position, not just cycle through colors—cycling leads to mismatches where small/large 5-regions get wrong colors.
 * Preserve all original non-5 cells (including legend shapes and separator); output is a copy of input with only picture 5's replaced.
 * Subtle: Components ignore 5's during legend extraction (treat as barriers/non-part), so legend is purely from solid shapes; discovery order matters for legend sequence (sort by label after flood-fill labeling).
 * No separator case: Treat entire grid as picture, fill all 5-components.
 * Edge cases: Uneven number of 5-components vs. legend colors (don't cycle; perhaps repeat or match explicitly); multiple separators (code assumes one); 5's adjacent to legend but not crossing separator.
 * Picture determination for vertical: Use count of 5's to decide left/right, but if equal, current code picks left—may need tiebreaker (e.g., first non-empty).
 * Flood-fill for 5's must respect picture boundaries (in_picture_func) to avoid spilling into legend.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_separator(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    n = len(g)
    # Check for horizontal separator
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            return 'h', r
    # Check for vertical separator
    for c in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
            return 'v', c
    return None, -1
```
(This correctly identifies the single separator row/column of 1's; useful for dividing legend vs. picture.)

```python
def get_picture_left(v_sep_index: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    num_left = sum(1 for r in range(n) for c in range(v_sep_index) if g[r][c] == 5)
    num_right = sum(1 for r in range(n) for c in range(v_sep_index + 1, n) if g[r][c] == 5)
    return num_left >= num_right
```
(This decides picture side for vertical separators by 5-count; correct but may need refinement for ties.)

```python
def find_pre_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    n = len(g)
    label = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    next_label = 1
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if label[i][j] == 0 and g[i][j] != 0 and g[i][j] != 5:
                color = g[i][j]
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                size = 1
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and label[nx][ny] == 0 and g[nx][ny] != 0 and g[nx][ny] != 5:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            size += 1
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, color, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components
```
(This correctly labels and extracts connected components for legend, excluding 0/1/5; size tracking is useful for potential shape matching; 4-dir adjacency is standard.)

```python
def get_legend_colors(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not components:
        return []
    # Find largest color 1 component to exclude
    max_size = 0
    excluded_label = -1
    for lid, col, sz in components:
        if col == 1 and sz > max_size:
            max_size = sz
            excluded_label = lid
    # Build unique colors in discovery order, skipping excluded
    color_set = set()
    legend = []
    # Sort by label to ensure discovery order
    components.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    for lid, col, sz in components:
        if lid != excluded_label and col not in color_set:
            color_set.add(col)
            legend.append(col)
    return legend
```
(This builds legend by unique colors in order, excluding largest 1-component; helpful but may need to include sizes for matching instead of just colors.)

```python
def flood_fill_region(output: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int, in_picture: callable):
    n = len(g)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny] and in_picture(nx, ny):
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This correctly flood-fills connected 5's with a single color, respecting picture boundaries; iterative stack avoids recursion depth issues.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies separators (both train examples preserve the row of 1's at row 5 unchanged).
 * Component extraction works: Legend colors are built in discovery order excluding largest 1 (e.g., train1 legend likely [2,3,4] or similar, applied to picture).
 * Picture side detection works for vertical (though not used in trains, which seem horizontal).
 * Flood-fill only targets picture 5's and preserves non-5's (upper legend and separator unchanged in both trains).
 * Missed shape/size matching: Fills each 5-component with next legend color via cycling (component_id % num_colors), but expected assigns specific colors to match legend shapes (e.g., train1 generated uses 2 in row13 col12-13 where expected has 4; generated row15 has 2's where expected has 4's in a larger blob).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated fills lower-left legend area incorrectly (e.g., row12 col8-9: 4,4 same as expected, but row13 col12-13: 2,2 vs expected 4,4; row14 col9-13:4's vs expected 4's but shifted; row16 col5:3 vs expected 3 same, but row20 col13-16:2's vs expected nothing/0? Wait, actually row20 generated has 2's in col12-15 where expected has nothing, indicating overfill outside picture). Overall, ~20-30% of picture cells wrong colors/sizes.
 * Train2 mismatches: Similar over-cycling; generated row11 col4:2 vs expected nothing (overfill?); row14 col2-8:2's vs expected 2's but wrong position; row20 col11-14:2's vs expected 3's in different area; row23 col4:3 vs expected nothing. Picture blobs get wrong colors (e.g., large bottom 3-blob partially 2 in generated).
 * Function `program` orchestrates well but assignment logic (cycling without matching) is broken—not helpful for core filling; replace with size/order matching.
 * No horizontal/vertical traversal order for 5-discovery affects component_id, leading to wrong sequence (e.g., train1 starts filling from bottom-left 5's, assigning early colors to wrong blobs).
 * Excludes all 1's except via largest, but small 1-blobs might be valid legend if not separator (subtle miss).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to fill some 5's but leaves many as-is or uses wrong colors, and includes fills outside expected picture (e.g., row1 col2-3:6,6 unchanged but surrounded by 0's; row2 col9-11:8,8,8 but test has complex 6/8/4 shapes suggesting legend on left/bottom, picture on right/top?).
 * Fills seem to cycle 1,8,6,4 but mismatch expected replication: e.g., row3 col14-18:4's correct for a horizontal bar, but row4 col13-14,18:4's sparse vs legend's solid 4-blob (row8-9 col0-1:4's small); large 8-blob in row20-29 col9+ gets 8 but interspersed with 0's/6's where should be solid.
 * Overfills non-picture: e.g., row7 col9-11:6,6,6 but if vertical separator at col12 (all 1's? input not shown, but output suggests no clear sep handling); row16 col14-17:8's but may be legend area.
 * Missing full replication: Legend seems to have 6-blob (row2-7 col1-7), 4-blob (row8 col0-1, row18-20 col1-3?), 8-blob (scattered), but picture (right side?) has partial matches only; many 5's (implied in input) remain unfilled or wrong (e.g., row22 col5-9:8's but jagged vs smooth legend).
 * To handle test: Need explicit shape matching (e.g., sort 5-components and legend by size/position, assign matching color); current cycling assigns 1 to thin verticals (row0-29 col24:1's) which may be wrong if 1 is background.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 20:35:36] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Color-coded squares and polyominoes**: Single or clustered pixel blocks in yellow, green, blue, red, orange, purple, and magenta, arranged in rows, columns, or irregular Tetris-like shapes (e.g., L, T, S, or custom forms) on black backgrounds, with some containing inner squares or voids; top sections feature linear progressions (1-3 inner elements), middle shows scattered 2-4 unit polyominoes per color, bottom displays complex orange multi-unit assemblies alongside a vertical sidebar of stacked colored squares (purple B, pink square, blue bar, yellow double dots).

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns observed across both training examples (Train input 1/output 1 and Train input 2/output 2), the following are obvious, direct interactions or effects between properties or components. These are limited to elements that demonstrably connect or influence each other in *every* example, without assuming unobservable semantics, movements, or transformations. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated black background, inconsistent color usages like purple/magenta not present in trains) are excluded. Only consistent effects (e.g., always preserved, always changed in the same way) are included. Unknowns (e.g., why specific legend shapes qualify as "small" or how non-train colors like maroon/pink interact) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Hole Count ↔ Color (for Orange Shapes)**
   - Hole count directly determines the target color for all orange shapes in the bottom section (post-blue separator).
     - Consistent effect: Orange shapes with identical hole counts always change to the *same* output color within an example (e.g., all h=0 → one specific color; all h=1 → another).
     - Cross-example consistency: h=0 always maps to the color of the first sequence shape (Yellow in Train 1, Red in Train 2); h=1 always maps to the color of the second sequence shape (Green in both).
     - For h=2: Maps to the color of the third sequence shape in Train 1 (Blue); no third sequence shape in Train 2, leading to removal (see below).
     - For h=3: Maps to the color of the fourth sequence shape in Train 1 (Red); no such in Train 2.
   - Effect direction: Hole count influences color change; output color does not alter hole count.
   - Components involved: Orange-colored polyominoes (clustered pixels >5, irregular bbox).
   - Unknown: How this mapping applies to non-orange colors (e.g., maroon h=2 or pink h=4 in tests); no train data shows non-orange bottom shapes being recolored.

#### 2. **Hole Count → Shape Presence/Removal (for Orange Shapes)**
   - Hole count affects whether an orange shape is retained or removed in the output.
     - Consistent effect: If hole count exceeds the number of initial sequence shapes (i.e., > max legend holes), the shape is removed (e.g., h=4 removed in Train 1; h=2 removed in Train 2, as max legend holes=1).
     - No change for h ≤ max (recolored but retained).
   - Effect direction: High hole count causes removal; low hole count preserves the shape (with color change).
   - Components involved: Orange polyominoes with h >0 (all removed cases in trains have h> max legend).
   - Cross-example consistency: Removal only occurs for "excess" holes; never for h=0 or h=1.
   - Unknown: Threshold for "excess" if no initial sequence shapes exist (e.g., Test 2 starts with h=1, not h=0); no train example for zero legend shapes.

#### 3. **Sequence Position → Hole Count Validation (for Legend Shapes)**
   - Position in the input list (assumed left-to-right/top-to-bottom order) interacts with hole count to classify shapes as "legend" (unchanged) vs. "transformable" (orange, post-blue).
     - Consistent effect: Initial consecutive shapes where hole count = position index -1 (h=0 for 1st, h=1 for 2nd, etc.) are classified as legend and remain unchanged.
       - Train 1: Positions 1-4 validate (h=0,1,2,3) → legend.
       - Train 2: Positions 1-2 validate (h=0,1); position 3 fails (h=0 ≠2) → stops at max h=1.
     - Failure to match expected hole count ends legend classification; subsequent shapes (including large oranges) become transformable.
   - Effect direction: Position enforces hole count check; mismatched hole count shifts shape to transformation rules.
   - Components involved: Initial small polyominoes (pixels ≤18, compact bbox like [1,1,3,3]).
   - Cross-example consistency: Legend always starts from position 1 with h=0; length varies by validation.

#### 4. **Legend Color → Target Color (for Matching Hole Counts)**
   - Colors of validated legend shapes directly influence the output color of orange shapes with matching hole counts.
     - Consistent effect: Output color for an orange shape's h=k is always the color of the legend shape at position k+1.
       - E.g., h=0 orange → color of position 1 legend (always preserved from input).
       - h=1 orange → color of position 2 legend (Green in both trains).
     - No effect on legend shapes themselves (they stay unchanged).
   - Effect direction: Legend color overrides orange color; no reverse influence.
   - Components involved: Legend polyominoes (top-row small shapes) ↔ bottom orange polyominoes.
   - Cross-example consistency: Only applies when h=k has a legend match; no over-mapping (e.g., no h=2 target in Train 2).

#### 5. **Color = Blue → No Change (All Properties)**
   - Shapes with color = blue are exempt from all transformations.
     - Consistent effect: Blue shapes retain exact color, holes, bbox, and pixels (e.g., blue line h=0 in Train 1; blue shape h=0 in Train 2).
     - Position in sequence does not affect them (can be legend-end or separator).
   - Effect direction: Blue color prevents interaction with holes, position, or legend.
   - Components involved: Linear or bar-like blue polyominoes (pixels=16-30, wide bbox like [0,5,29,5]).
   - Cross-example consistency: Always unchanged, even if h=0 (which would otherwise map to non-blue color).

#### 6. **Bbox ↔ Pixels (Preservation in Transformed Shapes)**
   - Bounding box (bbox) and pixel count are always preserved together for retained shapes (legend, blue, or successfully recolored oranges).
     - Consistent effect: No alteration; output bbox/pixels exactly match input for non-removed shapes (e.g., Train 1 orange h=0 [8,8,11,11] pixels=11 → output Yellow same bbox/pixels).
     - Removal affects both (entire shape gone, no partial preservation).
   - Effect direction: Mutual preservation; neither influences change in the other or in color/holes.
   - Components involved: All retained polyominoes (squares or clustered blocks).
   - Cross-example consistency: Always static; no position-based movement or pixel adjustment observed.

#### Non-Interactions (Excluded as Irrelevant or Inconsistent)
- No consistent position (bbox) effects on transformation: Bbox does not trigger color change, removal, or legend status (e.g., large bbox oranges transform like small ones).
- No hole count effects on bbox/pixels: Holes change color but never alter size or position.
- No interactions involving non-train colors (e.g., maroon, pink, yellow, dark red in tests): No train data shows them changing or influencing others; unknown if they follow orange rules.
- No consistent "movement" or silhouette/edge effects: All changes are in-place color swaps or removals; no bbox shifts or shape merging/splitting across examples.
- Pixels do not interact with anything: Always passive/preserved; no threshold-based effects (e.g., small vs. large pixels do not consistently affect removal or color).

[2025-10-03 20:36:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns observed across both training examples (Train input 1/output 1 and Train input 2/output 2), the following are obvious, direct interactions or effects between properties or components. These are limited to elements that demonstrably connect or influence each other in *every* example, without assuming unobservable semantics, movements, or transformations. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated black background, inconsistent color usages like purple/magenta not present in trains) are excluded. Only consistent effects (e.g., always preserved, always changed in the same way) are included. Unknowns (e.g., why specific legend shapes qualify as "small" or how non-train colors like maroon/pink interact) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Hole Count ↔ Color (for Orange Shapes)**
   - Hole count directly determines the target color for all orange shapes in the bottom section (post-blue separator).
     - Consistent effect: Orange shapes with identical hole counts always change to the *same* output color within an example (e.g., all h=0 → one specific color; all h=1 → another).
     - Cross-example consistency: h=0 always maps to the color of the first sequence shape (Yellow in Train 1, Red in Train 2); h=1 always maps to the color of the second sequence shape (Green in both).
     - For h=2: Maps to the color of the third sequence shape in Train 1 (Blue); no third sequence shape in Train 2, leading to removal (see below).
     - For h=3: Maps to the color of the fourth sequence shape in Train 1 (Red); no such in Train 2.
   - Effect direction: Hole count influences color change; output color does not alter hole count.
   - Components involved: Orange-colored polyominoes (clustered pixels >5, irregular bbox).
   - Unknown: How this mapping applies to non-orange colors (e.g., maroon h=2 or pink h=4 in tests); no train data shows non-orange bottom shapes being recolored.

#### 2. **Hole Count → Shape Presence/Removal (for Orange Shapes)**
   - Hole count affects whether an orange shape is retained or removed in the output.
     - Consistent effect: If hole count exceeds the number of initial sequence shapes (i.e., > max legend holes), the shape is removed (e.g., h=4 removed in Train 1; h=2 removed in Train 2, as max legend holes=1).
     - No change for h ≤ max (recolored but retained).
   - Effect direction: High hole count causes removal; low hole count preserves the shape (with color change).
   - Components involved: Orange polyominoes with h >0 (all removed cases in trains have h> max legend).
   - Cross-example consistency: Removal only occurs for "excess" holes; never for h=0 or h=1.
   - Unknown: Threshold for "excess" if no initial sequence shapes exist (e.g., Test 2 starts with h=1, not h=0); no train example for zero legend shapes.

#### 3. **Sequence Position → Hole Count Validation (for Legend Shapes)**
   - Position in the input list (assumed left-to-right/top-to-bottom order) interacts with hole count to classify shapes as "legend" (unchanged) vs. "transformable" (orange, post-blue).
     - Consistent effect: Initial consecutive shapes where hole count = position index -1 (h=0 for 1st, h=1 for 2nd, etc.) are classified as legend and remain unchanged.
       - Train 1: Positions 1-4 validate (h=0,1,2,3) → legend.
       - Train 2: Positions 1-2 validate (h=0,1); position 3 fails (h=0 ≠2) → stops at max h=1.
     - Failure to match expected hole count ends legend classification; subsequent shapes (including large oranges) become transformable.
   - Effect direction: Position enforces hole count check; mismatched hole count shifts shape to transformation rules.
   - Components involved: Initial small polyominoes (pixels ≤18, compact bbox like [1,1,3,3]).
   - Cross-example consistency: Legend always starts from position 1 with h=0; length varies by validation.

#### 4. **Legend Color → Target Color (for Matching Hole Counts)**
   - Colors of validated legend shapes directly influence the output color of orange shapes with matching hole counts.
     - Consistent effect: Output color for an orange shape's h=k is always the color of the legend shape at position k+1.
       - E.g., h=0 orange → color of position 1 legend (always preserved from input).
       - h=1 orange → color of position 2 legend (Green in both trains).
     - No effect on legend shapes themselves (they stay unchanged).
   - Effect direction: Legend color overrides orange color; no reverse influence.
   - Components involved: Legend polyominoes (top-row small shapes) ↔ bottom orange polyominoes.
   - Cross-example consistency: Only applies when h=k has a legend match; no over-mapping (e.g., no h=2 target in Train 2).

#### 5. **Color = Blue → No Change (All Properties)**
   - Shapes with color = blue are exempt from all transformations.
     - Consistent effect: Blue shapes retain exact color, holes, bbox, and pixels (e.g., blue line h=0 in Train 1; blue shape h=0 in Train 2).
     - Position in sequence does not affect them (can be legend-end or separator).
   - Effect direction: Blue color prevents interaction with holes, position, or legend.
   - Components involved: Linear or bar-like blue polyominoes (pixels=16-30, wide bbox like [0,5,29,5]).
   - Cross-example consistency: Always unchanged, even if h=0 (which would otherwise map to non-blue color).

#### 6. **Bbox ↔ Pixels (Preservation in Transformed Shapes)**
   - Bounding box (bbox) and pixel count are always preserved together for retained shapes (legend, blue, or successfully recolored oranges).
     - Consistent effect: No alteration; output bbox/pixels exactly match input for non-removed shapes (e.g., Train 1 orange h=0 [8,8,11,11] pixels=11 → output Yellow same bbox/pixels).
     - Removal affects both (entire shape gone, no partial preservation).
   - Effect direction: Mutual preservation; neither influences change in the other or in color/holes.
   - Components involved: All retained polyominoes (squares or clustered blocks).
   - Cross-example consistency: Always static; no position-based movement or pixel adjustment observed.

#### Non-Interactions (Excluded as Irrelevant or Inconsistent)
- No consistent position (bbox) effects on transformation: Bbox does not trigger color change, removal, or legend status (e.g., large bbox oranges transform like small ones).
- No hole count effects on bbox/pixels: Holes change color but never alter size or position.
- No interactions involving non-train colors (e.g., maroon, pink, yellow, dark red in tests): No train data shows them changing or influencing others; unknown if they follow orange rules.
- No consistent "movement" or silhouette/edge effects: All changes are in-place color swaps or removals; no bbox shifts or shape merging/splitting across examples.
- Pixels do not interact with anything: Always passive/preserved; no threshold-based effects (e.g., small vs. large pixels do not consistently affect removal or color).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 20:38:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where a legend of colored shapes (non-orange, spanning specific rows) with varying hole counts defines a mapping from hole numbers to colors, which is then used to recolor orange (5) shapes elsewhere in the grid based on their own hole counts (replacing with the mapped color or 0 if unmapped); the goal is to transform the entire grid accordingly while preserving non-relevant elements like dividers or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legend components must be non-5 colors and exactly span rows 1-3 (0-indexed), identified sequentially by hole count h matching their left-to-right position (expected_h starting at 0 and incrementing only on match; stop building on mismatch to handle incomplete/invalid legends).
 * Holes are 4-connected components of 0-cells fully enclosed within a shape's bounding box (min_r to max_r, min_c to max_c), specifically those not reachable via flood-fill from the bounding box's boundary 0-cells (background 0's are boundary-connected, holes are the remaining disconnected 0-CCs inside).
 * Orange (5) shapes are transformed component-by-component: compute their hole count h using the same bounding-box enclosure logic, then replace all cells in the component with legend[h] if it exists, else 0 (effectively removing unmapped shapes).
 * Grid is square (n x n), backgrounds are 0, shapes are solid connected components of the same non-0 color (4-connected adjacency).
 * Subtlety: Hole computation is local to each shape's bounding box to isolate internal enclosures, ignoring global connectivity or outside 0's; this prevents overcounting or undercounting due to adjacent shapes or grid edges.
 * Dividers (e.g., vertical bars of 1's) are not transformed and should remain as-is, as they are likely non-legend, non-orange components.
 * Legend building stops on mismatch to avoid incorrect mappings if the puzzle has validation (e.g., if a shape in position doesn't have the expected holes, don't use later ones).
 * Only transform orange components; other colors (including legend shapes) stay unchanged.
 * Edge case: Empty components or no holes yield 0; legend may be incomplete, leading to some oranges becoming 0.
 * Visually, shapes like letters (e.g., 'B' with 2 holes, 'A' with 1) are common, so hole counting must handle multi-hole enclosures correctly via separate CCs in remaining 0's.
 * Bounding box includes only the shape's extent, but hole flood-fill is constrained to it to define "enclosed."

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood_fill_to_find_component(grid: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], sr: int, sc: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

    pass  # Full code in attempt; handles empty comp as 0
```

```python

    """

    """
    Scans for legend: non-5 components in rows 1-3, maps h to color if h matches expected position.

```python
def transform_orange_shapes(grid: List[List[int]], legend: dict[int, int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """

    Core transformation step.
    """
    # (Implementation as in provided: copies grid, uses new_grid for replacement to avoid interfering with flood-fill)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of legend extraction, hole counting via bbox isolation, and orange transformation.
 * What worked: Accurate component detection with flood-fill; correct bbox-based hole logic that distinguishes enclosed vs. boundary 0's; sequential legend building with mismatch stopping; in-place transformation on a grid copy to preserve structure.
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test fully correct (see below), but no explicit failures noted; potential subtlety missed if legend shapes have internal structure affecting bbox (e.g., if they don't perfectly span cols, but code doesn't check col span).
 * Function `compute_min_max_r` is helpful but limited (only rows; cols computed inline elsewhere—could consolidate to full bbox util).
 * All provided functions (flood_fill, compute_holes, etc.) are relevant and working for the puzzle; no unhelpful or broken ones identified here, though future attempts should validate against edge cases like touching shapes or irregular bboxes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output appears mostly correct and makes sense based on puzzle rules: it shows a 30x30 grid with a vertical divider of 1's in column 24 (unchanged, as expected for non-orange/non-legend); transformed shapes of 8's (rows ~1-5, likely 2-hole 'B'-like, mapped from legend), 6's (rows ~7-16, possibly 1-hole or 0-hole patterns), and 4's (rows ~17-28, similar); gaps (all 0's) between sections preserved; top/bottom rows fully 0 except divider.
 * Observed effects: Patterns like [1,0,8,8,8,0] repeating suggest letter-like shapes with holes replaced correctly (e.g., 8's have internal 0's not transformed); no 5's remain, indicating all oranges processed; legend likely built from top (rows 1-3) with h=0,1,2,... mapping to 4,6,8 or similar.
 * Differences from expected: Hard to confirm without input grid, but output lacks any 5's or unmapped remnants (good); however, the 8/6/4 patterns repeat vertically more than typical (e.g., 8's in 3-row blocks x2 with gaps?), which might indicate over-transformation or legend misread if input had stacked oranges—possibly correct if input had multi-component oranges, but could be incorrect if legend h didn't match (e.g., if a shape has 3 holes but legend only to 2, should be 0 not 4/6/8). The long vertical spans for 6's/4's (8+ rows) suggest either tall shapes or multiple adjacent components merged incorrectly, differing from compact legend expectation—may need tighter component validation. Overall, it aligns with rules but feels elongated; unsure if exact match without input, but no obvious errors like leftover 5's or wrong colors.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 20:38:40] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 20:39:23] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), the following interactions and connections between components/properties are consistent across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships observed in the input-output transformations for orange shapes only (non-orange shapes show no changes). Only properties with consistent effects (e.g., color changes tied to holes) are included; irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated positions without transformation impact, pixel counts without alteration) or inconsistent ones (e.g., no reliable handling for holes >3) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or assumptions beyond observed patterns are made. Unknowns (e.g., exact handling for holes without legend matches) are noted explicitly.

1. **Orange color (component) ↔ Holes count (property)**:
   - Orange shapes interact with their own holes count to determine a color transformation.
   - Consistent effect: If holes = n and a legend mapping exists for n (see below), the orange color changes to the legend's color for that n; holes, bbox, and pixels remain unchanged.
   - Observed in every example: Multiple oranges with holes=0 or 1 always transform this way; higher holes (e.g., 2 in Train 1, 2 in Train 2) transform only if mapped, else see removal interaction.
   - No effect on non-orange shapes.

2. **Holes count (property) of orange shapes ↔ Legend shapes' colors (components)**:
   - The holes count in orange shapes connects to the colors of top-row legend shapes (small, non-orange components with explicit holes=0,1,2,...).
   - Consistent effect: Legend defines a mapping {holes=n → specific color}, which overrides the orange color if a match exists. Legend shapes themselves are unchanged.
   - In Train 1: Mapping is holes=0 → Yellow, 1 → Green, 2 → Blue, 3 → Red (based on top 4 small shapes).
   - In Train 2: Mapping is holes=0 → Red, 1 → Green (based on top 2 small shapes; no entries for 2+).
   - The mapping is positional/sequential in the legend (first small shape for 0, second for 1, etc.), but the connection is strictly holes-to-color override for oranges.

3. **Orange components ↔ Removal based on holes and legend availability**:
   - Orange shapes with holes=n interact with the legend's coverage: if no legend shape exists with holes=n (i.e., no mapping), the entire orange component is removed from the output list.
   - Consistent effect: Removal occurs without altering other properties; the output list preserves order of remaining items (legend + transformed oranges + unchanged non-oranges), skipping removed ones.
   - In Train 1: Orange with holes=4 removed (no legend entry for 4).
   - In Train 2: Orange with holes=2 removed (no legend entry for 2).
   - Unknown: Exact mechanism for holes > max legend holes (e.g., always remove?); consistent only in that it results in absence from output, but no further transformation (e.g., no color change or merger) observed.

4. **Bbox and pixels (properties) ↔ Orange color transformation**:
   - During color change (from orange to legend color), bbox and pixels of the orange shape remain fixed and unchanged.
   - Consistent effect: No interaction altering size, position, or filled area; these properties are preserved for all transformed oranges across examples.
   - No effect if removed (component gone entirely).

5. **List order (structural property) ↔ Transformations of orange components**:
   - The sequence of components in the input list interacts with orange transformations: unchanged legend/non-orange items and transformed oranges stay in their relative input order; removed oranges are skipped without reordering others.
   - Consistent effect: Output list mirrors input structure, with gaps closed by omission of removed items.
   - Observed in every example: Transformed oranges appear in the same sequence as their input counterparts, post-legend.

### Excluded or Unknown Elements
- **Non-orange components (e.g., top legend shapes, blue line-like shapes)**: No interactions or changes observed; they are always preserved exactly (color, holes, bbox, pixels unchanged). Inconsistent bbox for blue line (horizontal in Train 1, partial/different in Train 2), but no effect on others.
- **Pixels count**: Preserved but shows no causal interaction (e.g., no link to holes or color beyond staying constant).
- **Bbox positions**: Preserved but no observed transformation or movement effects (e.g., no position → color or position → holes shifts).
- **Holes >3 or unmapped holes**: Transformation unknown beyond removal; no consistent recoloring or other effect (e.g., modulo cycling not observed).
- **Other colors/shapes (e.g., maroon, pink, yellow in tests; dark red in Test 2)**: Not present in trains, so no consistent interactions identifiable.
- No shape silhouettes, edges, or semantic meanings (e.g., polyomino types like L/S) show interactions; only holes and color are linked.
- No color → holes or reverse effects; flow is unidirectional (holes/legend → orange color).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 20:39:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), the following interactions and connections between components/properties are consistent across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships observed in the input-output transformations for orange shapes only (non-orange shapes show no changes). Only properties with consistent effects (e.g., color changes tied to holes) are included; irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated positions without transformation impact, pixel counts without alteration) or inconsistent ones (e.g., no reliable handling for holes >3) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or assumptions beyond observed patterns are made. Unknowns (e.g., exact handling for holes without legend matches) are noted explicitly.

1. **Orange color (component) ↔ Holes count (property)**:
   - Orange shapes interact with their own holes count to determine a color transformation.
   - Consistent effect: If holes = n and a legend mapping exists for n (see below), the orange color changes to the legend's color for that n; holes, bbox, and pixels remain unchanged.
   - Observed in every example: Multiple oranges with holes=0 or 1 always transform this way; higher holes (e.g., 2 in Train 1, 2 in Train 2) transform only if mapped, else see removal interaction.
   - No effect on non-orange shapes.

2. **Holes count (property) of orange shapes ↔ Legend shapes' colors (components)**:
   - The holes count in orange shapes connects to the colors of top-row legend shapes (small, non-orange components with explicit holes=0,1,2,...).
   - Consistent effect: Legend defines a mapping {holes=n → specific color}, which overrides the orange color if a match exists. Legend shapes themselves are unchanged.
   - In Train 1: Mapping is holes=0 → Yellow, 1 → Green, 2 → Blue, 3 → Red (based on top 4 small shapes).
   - In Train 2: Mapping is holes=0 → Red, 1 → Green (based on top 2 small shapes; no entries for 2+).
   - The mapping is positional/sequential in the legend (first small shape for 0, second for 1, etc.), but the connection is strictly holes-to-color override for oranges.

3. **Orange components ↔ Removal based on holes and legend availability**:
   - Orange shapes with holes=n interact with the legend's coverage: if no legend shape exists with holes=n (i.e., no mapping), the entire orange component is removed from the output list.
   - Consistent effect: Removal occurs without altering other properties; the output list preserves order of remaining items (legend + transformed oranges + unchanged non-oranges), skipping removed ones.
   - In Train 1: Orange with holes=4 removed (no legend entry for 4).
   - In Train 2: Orange with holes=2 removed (no legend entry for 2).
   - Unknown: Exact mechanism for holes > max legend holes (e.g., always remove?); consistent only in that it results in absence from output, but no further transformation (e.g., no color change or merger) observed.

4. **Bbox and pixels (properties) ↔ Orange color transformation**:
   - During color change (from orange to legend color), bbox and pixels of the orange shape remain fixed and unchanged.
   - Consistent effect: No interaction altering size, position, or filled area; these properties are preserved for all transformed oranges across examples.
   - No effect if removed (component gone entirely).

5. **List order (structural property) ↔ Transformations of orange components**:
   - The sequence of components in the input list interacts with orange transformations: unchanged legend/non-orange items and transformed oranges stay in their relative input order; removed oranges are skipped without reordering others.
   - Consistent effect: Output list mirrors input structure, with gaps closed by omission of removed items.
   - Observed in every example: Transformed oranges appear in the same sequence as their input counterparts, post-legend.

### Excluded or Unknown Elements
- **Non-orange components (e.g., top legend shapes, blue line-like shapes)**: No interactions or changes observed; they are always preserved exactly (color, holes, bbox, pixels unchanged). Inconsistent bbox for blue line (horizontal in Train 1, partial/different in Train 2), but no effect on others.
- **Pixels count**: Preserved but shows no causal interaction (e.g., no link to holes or color beyond staying constant).
- **Bbox positions**: Preserved but no observed transformation or movement effects (e.g., no position → color or position → holes shifts).
- **Holes >3 or unmapped holes**: Transformation unknown beyond removal; no consistent recoloring or other effect (e.g., modulo cycling not observed).
- **Other colors/shapes (e.g., maroon, pink, yellow in tests; dark red in Test 2)**: Not present in trains, so no consistent interactions identifiable.
- No shape silhouettes, edges, or semantic meanings (e.g., polyomino types like L/S) show interactions; only holes and color are linked.
- No color → holes or reverse effects; flow is unidirectional (holes/legend → orange color).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 20:41:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where connected components of placeholder pixels (value 5) represent shapes that must be replaced with digits (1-4) based on the number of internal holes they enclose, using a key derived from patterns in rows 1-3 of the grid. The goal is to identify these components, count their enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the exterior background), map hole counts to digits via the key, fill the component and its holes with the mapped digit, and set unmapped components to 0, while preserving other grid elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid is fixed at 30x30 (H=30, W=30); assume input g is this size, with 0 as background/empty, 5 as placeholders for shapes, and digits 1-4 already placed or to be placed.
 * Shapes are 4-connected components of 5's (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Holes are internal 0-components not reachable from the grid borders (exterior flood-fill from borders marks background 0's); only count hole components adjacent to exactly one shape component (via 4-directions) to avoid shared holes between shapes.
 * Key extraction from rows 1-3: Look for horizontal runs of the same non-0/5 digit in row 1 (length >=3), check if row 3 matches exactly, then count 0's in the corresponding segment of row 2 to get hole_count -> digit mapping (e.g., 0 zeros might map to solid digit, 1 zero to digit with one hole).
 * Replacement: For each shape component, use its hole count to look up the digit in the mapping; if found, replace all 5's in the component and all pixels in its associated hole(s) with the digit; if not found, set the 5's to 0 (but do not touch holes).
 * Subtleties: Mapping is built only from valid key segments (matching rows 1/3, length >=3); multiple keys possible, but assume unique hole counts. Holes must be fully enclosed (no border connection). Adjacency for hole-to-shape is 4-directional and checks comp_id. Preserve existing digits (1-4) and background 0's outside shapes/holes. Components with 0 holes or multiple adjacent holes might default to 0 or need special handling. The key might not cover all hole counts, leading to defaults. In trains, shapes have irregular forms (e.g., not fully filled), so replacement must fill exactly the 5's and holes, not expand. Exterior flood must handle all border 0's, including corners, to correctly identify internals.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

# Directions for 4-connectivity
dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly identifies 5-components, marks exterior 0's, finds internal holes, assigns them to single-adjacent shapes, builds a row 1-3 mapping based on 0-counts in row 2, and replaces 5's + holes with mapped digit (or 0 if unmapped).
 * What worked: Component finding via BFS accurately groups 5's; exterior flood-fill correctly identifies background 0's (no leaks in trains); hole finding and single-adjacency check is logically sound; mapping extraction skips short/non-matching segments and uses exact 0-counts.
 * What didn't work: In train 1, generated mismatches expected in multiple shapes—e.g., row 10: generated [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,...] (3's not fully filled, missing hole at col 4); row 11: generated solid 4's vs expected with holes; row 12: generated [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,...] vs expected with holes in 1's area; row 14: generated solid 4's/holes mismatch; lower 2's and 1's have wrong patterns (e.g., row 20: generated solid 3's vs expected with holes; row 21: generated [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,...] but later rows show 2's/1's with incorrect hole placements like solid vs dotted). Reason unknown, but likely overcounting holes or wrong adjacency (e.g., shared/multi-adj holes not handled, or mapping misapplied to wrong count). Train 1 also leaves some 5's as 0 implicitly but shapes are incomplete.
 * In train 2, generated mismatches: row 10: generated [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...] but later rows show 3's with wrong fills (e.g., row 11: generated partial 2's vs expected with holes in 3's; row 15: generated 2's block vs expected with holes; lower 3's in rows 23-27 have solid/missing holes, e.g., row 24: generated [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] but patterns don't match dotted expectations). Likely same issue: incorrect hole assignment or mapping (e.g., treating multi-hole or shared as single, or wrong num0 in key).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding (core component/hole logic), but fails to reproduce exact shapes, suggesting bugs in hole counting (e.g., counting size instead of components? Code counts components via +=1 per hole group, but trains suggest per-pixel or different metric) or adjacency (perhaps holes adjacent to multiple via indirect paths). No unhelpful functions; all provided (BFS, flood, mapping) are essential and mostly correct, but hole assignment may need refinement (e.g., ensure holes are fully enclosed by one shape only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed logic as trains, replacing presumed 5's with 8,6,4 in patterned blocks (e.g., rows 2-6 show 8's with hole-like 0's preserved? No, it fills some but leaves 0's in patterns matching input holes, but digits like 8/6/4 suggest wrong mapping—puzzle likely expects 1-4 only, not higher; right column has solid 1's preserved correctly, but upper 8's block (rows 2-6) has inconsistent fills (e.g., row 2: 8,8,8 at end but 0's elsewhere; row 3: dotted 8's), lower 6's (rows 8-16) are dotted but overfilled in places, and bottom 4's (rows 18-28) similarly dotted but not matching typical 1-4 hole patterns from trains. It mismatches expected puzzle output by using invalid digits (8,6,4 instead of mapping to 1-4) and incomplete fills (e.g., not closing holes properly in 8's/6's/4's blocks), likely due to same hole-counting error—mentally, test input seems to have key in top (implied rows 1-3 with patterns for 1-4), and shapes with 0/1/2 holes, so output should replace with 1-4 in exact input shapes + filled holes, but generated leaves dotted 0's and uses wrong values, indicating mapping failure or misidentification of 5's (test shows 8/6/4/1 already? Wait, input has 8/6/4 as existing? No, generated is post-process, but trains suggest 5's become 1-4; here it seems to treat existing digits as 5's wrongly or mapping pulls wrong values).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 20:41:45] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 20:42:14] Response:
### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), the following interactions and connections are consistent across both. These are limited to obvious, direct effects between elements/properties that appear in every train puzzle and influence transformations uniformly. No assumptions are made about unshown test inputs, semantic meanings, or puzzle solutions. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background, static borders without transformation) are excluded. Non-consistent or unclear effects (e.g., why specific removals occur beyond the stated condition, or any position-based transformations) are noted as unknown but not forced.

#### 1. **Key Blocks → Polyomino Color Transformation**
   - **Components Involved**: 
     - "Key blocks": Small, solid colored square blocks (e.g., 3x3 or similar, with precise hole counts: 0, 1, 2, or 3) positioned at the top-left (e.g., bbox starting near [1,1]).
     - "Polyomino shapes": Larger, irregular connected square clusters (Tetris-like, initially orange, with varying hole counts 0+), positioned below the keys (e.g., bbox starting after y=5 or similar).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The hole count property of a polyomino directly determines its color change in the output, by matching it to the color of the key block with the identical hole count. 
     - If a polyomino's holes = n and a key block exists with holes = n and color C, the polyomino's color transforms to C (bbox, pixels, and holes remain unchanged).
     - Examples:
       - Train 1: Keys define Yellow (holes=0), Green (holes=1), Blue (holes=2), Red (holes=3). Polyominoes with matching holes transform accordingly (e.g., orange holes=0 → Yellow; orange holes=3 → Red).
       - Train 2: Keys define Red (holes=0), Green (holes=1). Polyominoes with matching holes transform accordingly (e.g., orange holes=0 → Red; orange holes=1 → Green).
   - **Consistency**: Present and identical in both trains; no polyomino transforms without a matching key hole count.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: The exact mechanism for key placement or why only certain hole counts (0-3 max) appear in keys is unknown; it does not affect the hole → color mapping.

#### 2. **Hole Count Mismatch in Polyominoes → Shape Removal**
   - **Components Involved**: Polyomino shapes (as above), cross-referenced against key blocks' hole counts.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: If a polyomino's hole count = n and no key block exists with holes = n, the entire polyomino is removed from the output (no trace in bbox, pixels, color, or holes).
     - Examples:
       - Train 1: Polyomino with holes=4 has no matching key (keys only up to 3), so removed (bbox=[2,22,9,29], pixels=46 absent in output).
       - Train 2: Polyomino with holes=2 has no matching key (keys only up to 1), so removed (bbox=[11,23,17,28], pixels=23 absent in output).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs exactly once per train for the highest non-matching hole count; no other removals happen.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Why exactly one such mismatch exists per puzzle or any side effects (e.g., on layout) is unknown; the effect is strictly removal based on mismatch.

#### 3. **Blue Bars/Lines → No Transformation (Static Preservation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Horizontal or rectangular blue elements (thin bars or dividers, holes=0, spanning multiple units, e.g., bbox like [0,5,29,5] or [0,0,9,6]).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These elements have no interaction with keys, polyominoes, or hole counts; their color, bbox, pixels, and holes remain entirely unchanged across input to output.
     - Examples:
       - Train 1: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[0,5,29,5], pixels=30) preserved as-is.
       - Train 2: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[0,0,9,6], pixels=16) preserved as-is.
   - **Consistency**: Always static in both trains; acts as a non-interacting separator (e.g., between keys and polyominoes) but without any effect on other elements.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Their precise role (e.g., divider vs. frame) is unknown; no transformation occurs regardless.

No other consistent interactions are identifiable (e.g., no position → color effects, as bboxes are preserved without shifts; no pixel count → anything, as pixels stay fixed; no cross-color influences like orange → other non-key colors; no effects from dots/sub-squares or vertical stacks, as they do not appear or transform consistently). Properties like bbox and pixels are preserved in transformations but do not cause effects themselves.

[2025-10-03 20:42:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), the following interactions and connections are consistent across both. These are limited to obvious, direct effects between elements/properties that appear in every train puzzle and influence transformations uniformly. No assumptions are made about unshown test inputs, semantic meanings, or puzzle solutions. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background, static borders without transformation) are excluded. Non-consistent or unclear effects (e.g., why specific removals occur beyond the stated condition, or any position-based transformations) are noted as unknown but not forced.

#### 1. **Key Blocks → Polyomino Color Transformation**
   - **Components Involved**: 
     - "Key blocks": Small, solid colored square blocks (e.g., 3x3 or similar, with precise hole counts: 0, 1, 2, or 3) positioned at the top-left (e.g., bbox starting near [1,1]).
     - "Polyomino shapes": Larger, irregular connected square clusters (Tetris-like, initially orange, with varying hole counts 0+), positioned below the keys (e.g., bbox starting after y=5 or similar).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The hole count property of a polyomino directly determines its color change in the output, by matching it to the color of the key block with the identical hole count. 
     - If a polyomino's holes = n and a key block exists with holes = n and color C, the polyomino's color transforms to C (bbox, pixels, and holes remain unchanged).
     - Examples:
       - Train 1: Keys define Yellow (holes=0), Green (holes=1), Blue (holes=2), Red (holes=3). Polyominoes with matching holes transform accordingly (e.g., orange holes=0 → Yellow; orange holes=3 → Red).
       - Train 2: Keys define Red (holes=0), Green (holes=1). Polyominoes with matching holes transform accordingly (e.g., orange holes=0 → Red; orange holes=1 → Green).
   - **Consistency**: Present and identical in both trains; no polyomino transforms without a matching key hole count.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: The exact mechanism for key placement or why only certain hole counts (0-3 max) appear in keys is unknown; it does not affect the hole → color mapping.

#### 2. **Hole Count Mismatch in Polyominoes → Shape Removal**
   - **Components Involved**: Polyomino shapes (as above), cross-referenced against key blocks' hole counts.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: If a polyomino's hole count = n and no key block exists with holes = n, the entire polyomino is removed from the output (no trace in bbox, pixels, color, or holes).
     - Examples:
       - Train 1: Polyomino with holes=4 has no matching key (keys only up to 3), so removed (bbox=[2,22,9,29], pixels=46 absent in output).
       - Train 2: Polyomino with holes=2 has no matching key (keys only up to 1), so removed (bbox=[11,23,17,28], pixels=23 absent in output).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs exactly once per train for the highest non-matching hole count; no other removals happen.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Why exactly one such mismatch exists per puzzle or any side effects (e.g., on layout) is unknown; the effect is strictly removal based on mismatch.

#### 3. **Blue Bars/Lines → No Transformation (Static Preservation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Horizontal or rectangular blue elements (thin bars or dividers, holes=0, spanning multiple units, e.g., bbox like [0,5,29,5] or [0,0,9,6]).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These elements have no interaction with keys, polyominoes, or hole counts; their color, bbox, pixels, and holes remain entirely unchanged across input to output.
     - Examples:
       - Train 1: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[0,5,29,5], pixels=30) preserved as-is.
       - Train 2: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[0,0,9,6], pixels=16) preserved as-is.
   - **Consistency**: Always static in both trains; acts as a non-interacting separator (e.g., between keys and polyominoes) but without any effect on other elements.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Their precise role (e.g., divider vs. frame) is unknown; no transformation occurs regardless.

No other consistent interactions are identifiable (e.g., no position → color effects, as bboxes are preserved without shifts; no pixel count → anything, as pixels stay fixed; no cross-color influences like orange → other non-key colors; no effects from dots/sub-squares or vertical stacks, as they do not appear or transform consistently). Properties like bbox and pixels are preserved in transformations but do not cause effects themselves.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 20:44:40] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves a 30x30 grid where connected components of colored pixels (1-4) act as "keys" that encode a mapping based on the number of enclosed zero-spaces (holes) they surround, and components of 5's (placeholders) must be transformed by replacing them with the color from the matching key based on their own hole count. The goal is to correctly identify and map these keys, then apply the transformation to all 5-components without altering other parts of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys are connected components (flood-fill 4-directional adjacency) of the same non-zero, non-5 color; only certain components qualify as keys (in this attempt, those spanning exactly 3 rows vertically, which may be too restrictive and miss horizontal or irregular shapes).
 * The "h" value (hole count) for a component is the number of 0-cells fully enclosed by it (all 4 orthogonal neighbors must be part of the component), but this may overcount or miscount if holes are not fully internal or if boundary conditions are mishandled; subtle issue: enclosure check assumes a closed loop, but may fail for open or partial surrounds.
 * Mapping is from h to the component's color C, but assumes unique h per key; if multiple keys have the same h, it overwrites (last one wins), which could cause errors if duplicates exist.
 * 5-components are transformed uniformly to the mapped color if h matches a key; if no match, defaults to 0 (erasing them), which is likely wrong—expected outputs show 5's becoming specific colors like 1,2,3,4 without erasure.
 * Grid is mostly empty (0's), with patterns resembling letters/numbers (e.g., vertical bars, E-shapes); keys are likely the small, structured patterns (e.g., height-3 verticals in training), while 5's mimic those shapes but need recoloring.
 * Subtle: Components must be exactly connected same-value cells; diagonals don't count. Also, keys exclude 5's and 0's; processing order (keys first, then 5's) is correct but visited tracking prevents reprocessing.
 * Easy to miss: Height check (maxr - minr +1 ==3) works for training vertical keys but fails if keys are wider/shorter; h computation iterates all 0's globally, which is inefficient but correct in principle, but may count holes outside the component if neighbors overlap multiple components.
 * All non-key components (e.g., large blobs) are left unchanged; output is a copy of input with only 5's modified.
 * Considerations from attempts: Flood-fill must handle stack-based DFS correctly to avoid stack overflow on large components (N=30 is small, so fine); h=0 for no holes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    N = 30
    C = g[start_r][start_c]
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(start_r, start_c)]
    component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    visited[start_r][start_c] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == C:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood_fill is correct and essential for extracting connected components of same color; uses DFS stack, marks visited to avoid overlap.)

```python
def compute_h(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    N = 30
    comp_set = set(component)
    h = 0
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if g[i][j] == 0:
                neigh_pos = [(i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in dirs]
                if all(0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and (ni, nj) in comp_set for ni, nj in neigh_pos):
                    h += 1
    return h
```
(This computes enclosed holes by checking if every 0 has all 4 neighbors in the component; helpful but potentially flawed for non-simply-connected shapes—counts any fully surrounded 0, even if not "inside" the intended hole; use set for fast lookup.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies vertical height-3 components as keys and computes h as enclosed 0's, but the height restriction misses non-vertical keys (e.g., in training 1 expected, some 3's and 1's are horizontal or irregular).
 * Mapping works partially (e.g., transforms some 5's to correct colors like 2's in top of training 1), but overwrites or misses due to h mismatches—e.g., in training 1, generated keeps 4's where expected has 3's in rows 9-11 cols 3-5, and places 4's instead of 1's in rows 11-12 cols 20-25.
 * In training 1, generated has 4's in a scattered pattern (e.g., row 9 col 9-11, row 10 col 2-3,8-11) where expected has 3's there and shifts 1's/4's elsewhere; unknown why h computation mismatches, possibly because enclosure check counts global 0's incorrectly for those components.
 * In training 2, generated places 2's in large blobs (e.g., rows 14-16 cols 12-29) where expected has 3's, and misses 3's in bottom (e.g., row 9 col 26-27 generated 2's, expected 3's); also generates extra 2's in row 8 cols 24-25 where expected 0's.
 * transform_fives correctly applies mapping to 5-components via flood-fill, but defaults to 0 on no match, which erases some 5's incorrectly (e.g., training 1 row 17 has generated 0's where expected 1's/3's).
 * identify_keys skips components without height==3, causing misses (e.g., training 2 has wider 3-key at bottom, not detected).
 * Overall, h computation seems to work for simple vertical keys (e.g., top 1,2,3,4 in training 1 match), but fails for complex shapes; no unhelpful functions—all are relevant, but height filter is broken for generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places vertical columns of 1's (e.g., col 24 rows 0-29) where input likely has empty or other patterns, suggesting over-transformation or misdetection of keys as 1's.
 * Patterns of 8,6,4 appear in blocks (e.g., rows 1-6 cols 26-28 as 8's with gaps mimicking E-shape, rows 7-16 cols 26-28 as 6's, rows 17-28 cols 26-28 as 4's), which seem to directly copy input 5-shapes but recolor them sequentially (8→6→4), but this doesn't match training logic—likely wrong because training expected specific recolors (1-4) based on holes, not arbitrary 4/6/8; 8 and 6 aren't in expected colors (only 1-4), so mapping is inventing invalid colors.
 * Missing transformations: Input test (inferred from output) has repeated vertical E-like 5's, but output doesn't match hole-based logic (e.g., all get different colors without clear h-variation); erases some to 0's incorrectly, similar to training defaults.
 * Does not make sense: If keys have h mapping to 1-4, output shouldn't produce 6/8; likely h miscomputed for test keys, or no keys detected, falling back to wrong defaults—needs better key identification beyond height=3.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 20:44:48] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 20:45:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a puzzle involving the identification and 4-coloring (using values 1-4) of distinct connected regions (blobs or components) in a grid where cells with values >=5 represent "filled" or "land" areas, and 0 represents empty space. The goal is to assign colors to these regions such that no two adjacent regions (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-color theorem principles for map coloring, while preserving the original 0s and ensuring the output grid reflects properly separated and colored regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), based on cells >=5 being grouped into components via flood-fill or BFS/DFS.
 * Coloring must ensure adjacent regions (i.e., components that touch edge-to-edge) get different colors from {1,2,3,4}; sequential modulo-4 assignment fails because it doesn't check adjacency and can assign the same color to neighbors.
 * Preserve exact shapes of regions: output must match input connectivity for >=5 cells, replacing them with colors but keeping 0s unchanged; subtle patterns like stripes, isolated cells, or irregular blobs must be respected without merging or splitting.
 * Input grids likely have values >=5 as uniform "filled" (ignoring exact value beyond threshold), but outputs show structured patterns (e.g., horizontal/vertical stripes in top of train1, clustered blobs in lower areas), suggesting regions are predefined shapes that need proper separation.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components: each gets a unique color relative to its neighbors; global sequential labeling ignores graph structure (adjacency graph of components).
 * Empty rows/columns of 0s act as separators; do not color them.
 * Subtle: Some regions in expected outputs appear to be single cells or small groups (e.g., isolated 1s or 3s), while others are larger; the program over-labels large areas uniformly but fails on color conflicts.
 * Threshold >=5 is key for identifying filled cells; cells <5 (likely 0-4) stay as-is or are treated as empty, but in outputs, low numbers like 1-4 are colors, so inputs probably use high values only for filled.
 * Potential for odd-shaped adjacencies: regions can interlock or touch at edges without sharing cells, requiring adjacency check post-component extraction.
 * All training examples show patterned regions (e.g., train1 has cross-like or barred patterns in colors 1-4), implying the puzzle may involve recognizing or enforcing specific topologies like non-overlapping territories.

                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] >= 5 and label[nx][ny] == 0:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, min_r, min_c, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components, label  # Return components info and label grid for further use

    # Remove duplicates
    for i in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies connected components using BFS flood-fill for cells >=5, which works for extracting region shapes (e.g., top rows in train1 match expected patterns for 4,3,1,2 regions).
 * However, it fails on coloring: assigns colors via (label-1) % 4 + 1, which is sequential and ignores adjacency, leading to same-color adjacent regions (e.g., in train1 lower sections, generated has mismatched 1,2,3,4 placements like row9 having 1s where expected has 4s, and row11 having 3s vs expected 1s; unknown why shapes differ slightly in lower blobs, possibly due to over-merging or incorrect labeling start).
 * Train1 generated matches expected exactly in rows 1-3 (patterned 4,3,1,2 stripes) and row5 (all 1s? wait, generated row5 all 0s but expected row5 all 0s, row6 all 1s matches), but diverges in rows 8+ (e.g., generated row9 has 0,0,0,2,2,2,0... with 1s misplaced; expected has 0s, then 4s in row8; generated incorrectly labels small blobs as continuing prior colors).
 * Train2 generated matches top rows partially (2,3,1 patterns), but mismatches in mid-sections (e.g., row2 has 1s where expected has 2s in a cluster; row10 has 3s where expected has 2s), and lower areas like row23 have scattered 3s/4s vs expected structured 3s.
 * No samples pass, indicating core issue is lack of graph coloring; sequential mod-4 is broken for adjacency conflicts.
 * The labeling function is helpful for extraction but insufficient alone; needs adjacency detection and greedy/backtracking coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the direct output assignment in the attempt (without saving components first) makes debugging hard; future attempts should separate extraction from coloring.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows fragmented and inconsistent coloring (e.g., row0 has isolated 1s, row2 has a large 2-blob with embedded 4s that seem adjacent to same-color areas, row20 has a sprawling 3-blob touching what looks like same-color 3s nearby without separation).
 * It appears to apply the same flawed sequential labeling, resulting in adjacent same-colors (e.g., multiple 1-blobs touching in rows 4-6 without differentiation; 4s in row22-29 form irregular shapes that likely conflict with neighbors like 3s in row18-20).
 * Patterns suggest over-merging or incorrect component boundaries (e.g., row9-16 have 2s and 4s intermingled in ways that don't form clean regions, unlike expected structured blobs in training); it misses the need for proper 4-coloring to avoid conflicts, leading to a noisy, non-map-like output.
 * To handle test case, must build an adjacency graph post-labeling and assign colors greedily (e.g., try 1-4 for each component, avoiding neighbors' colors); test seems to have more interlocking regions (e.g., 1s and 3s alternating but failing), so account for complex topologies.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based coloring puzzle (30x30) divided by a full separator line of 1's (horizontal row or vertical column) into a "legend" side (with pre-colored shapes indicating available colors) and a "picture" side (with outlines in various numbers and blank regions marked as 5's to be filled). The goal is to identify connected components of 5's on the picture side via flood fill and assign colors from the legend's unique colors (excluding 0 and 5), likely in a specific order such as cycling by component discovery or matching by shape/size/position, while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator must be a complete row or column entirely filled with 1's; prioritize horizontal search first, then vertical if none found—missing this leads to no separation and no filling.
 * Legend side extraction: Scan the designated legend area (e.g., above horizontal sep or right of vertical sep) row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to collect unique colors !=0 and !=5 in the order they first appear; this order seems critical for assignment, but simply cycling by discovery order fails as it mismatches expected color placements.
 * Picture side filling: Only fill connected components of 5's (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) using flood fill; components must be discovered in row-major order starting from the picture area (e.g., below horizontal sep or left of vertical sep); do not fill non-5 cells or cross boundaries.
 * Side orientation subtlety: For horizontal sep, legend is typically above (rows 0 to sep-1), picture below (rows sep+1 to end); for vertical sep, the code assumes legend right (cols sep+1 to end), picture left (cols 0 to sep-1), but this may be inverted in some cases (e.g., legend left, picture right), causing unfilled 5's or filling the wrong side—check which side has pre-colors vs. 5's.
 * Color assignment nuance: Not arbitrary cycling; expected outputs suggest assignment by component order (row-major discovery) but with legend colors in strict appearance order, or possibly matching components to legend shapes by size, position, or sequence—cycling works partially but leads to color swaps (e.g., 2 where 4 expected).
 * Grid boundaries: n=30 fixed; output starts as copy of input, only modify 5's in picture side; 0's are empty/background, other numbers are fixed outlines/colors—do not overwrite them.
 * Edge cases: No sep means return unchanged grid; empty legend (no colors) means no filling; multiple components may exceed legend colors, requiring cycling, but order matters; 5's may be isolated or large blobs; vertical seps may not stretch full height if code assumes they do.
 * Scanning order: All discovery (colors, components) must be consistent row-major to match expectations; stack-based flood fill is correct but ensure visited prevents overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Legend may have 5's (ignore them); components cannot cross sep (1's block); if sep not found or wrong side, 5's remain unfilled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_separator(n: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    # Finds horizontal (h) or vertical (v) full line of 1's; returns type and index, or None/-1
    sep_type = None
    sep_index = -1
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            sep_type = 'h'
            sep_index = r
            break
    if sep_type is None:
        for c in range(n):
            if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
                sep_type = 'v'
                sep_index = c
                break
    return sep_type, sep_index
```
(This works well for sep detection, as seen in partial matches in training outputs.)

```python
def extract_legend_colors(n: int, g: List[List[int]], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts unique non-0/non-5 colors from legend side in row-major order
    legend_colors = []
    seen = set()
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index):
            for c in range(n):
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index + 1, n):  # Assumes legend right; may need flip to range(sep_index)
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    return legend_colors
```
(This is helpful for color collection but may need side flip for vertical; order is key but simplistic uniqueness misses shape-based ordering.)

```python
def self_fill(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], color: int, sr: int, sc: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    # Stack-based flood fill for 5's only; marks visited and sets output to color
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This flood fill is correct and essential; prevents overfill and handles components accurately; directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)].)

```python
def color_picture_side(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], legend_colors: List[int], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> None:
    # Discovers and fills components in row-major order on picture side, cycling colors
    if not legend_colors:
        return
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component_id = 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index + 1, n):
            for c in range(n):
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index):  # Assumes picture left; may need flip to range(sep_index + 1, n)
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
```
(This is mostly helpful for component discovery but fails on color cycling/order and potential side flip; row-major scan is good.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly detects the horizontal separator in training example 1 (top legend intact, bottom filling attempted) and copies the input grid unchanged where appropriate, but fails to assign correct colors to components (e.g., uses [4,3,1,2] cycling, resulting in 2's where expected 4's in row 12 cols 12-13, 3's where 2's in row 20, and mismatches in rows 13-16/22-29; specific differences: generated row 12 has 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs. expected 4,4; row 13 has 2,2,2,2 at cols 9-12 vs. expected 4's shifted; row 17 has 3 at col 5 vs. expected nothing/0 there but 3's elsewhere).
 * For training example 2 (likely vertical sep), sep detection may succeed but side assignment is wrong (assumes legend right/picture left, but expected fills suggest legend left/picture right with 2's and 3's); many 5's remain unfilled (e.g., generated row 2 cols 14-23 are all 5's vs. expected 2's; row 4 cols 13-25 5's vs. expected 2's; row 9 cols 10-12 5's vs. expected 2's; row 20 cols 20-24 5's vs. expected 3's), and some left-side filling occurs incorrectly with 2,3,1 (e.g., row 1 cols 1-3 2's match but cols 19-20 5's unfilled vs. expected 2's).
 * Color cycling by component_id % len(legend_colors) works partially for small components but mismatches sequence (e.g., ex1 first bottom component gets 4 in generated but expected implies different start like 3 or shape-matching); unknown why exact order fails, possibly needs legend shape extraction/matching by size or position rather than scan order.
 * extract_legend_colors collects correctly for horizontal (e.g., ex1 gets [4,3,1,2]) but may collect from wrong side for vertical (ex2 legend likely left, leading to empty or wrong colors, causing no/minimal filling).
 * find_separator is reliable (no false negatives in outputs) but doesn't handle potential multiple seps or partial lines.
 * self_fill is accurate (no overfills or leaks in generated outputs) and essential for components.
 * Overall program structure (copy input, find sep, extract, fill) demonstrates core understanding but breaks on vertical orientation, color ordering, and possibly component-to-color mapping; no handling for no-sep case beyond return (but ex2 suggests sep exists); unhelpful: no shape/size matching function (needed?); visited is per-run only, correct but could miss global 5's if side wrong.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains most input numbers (e.g., 6's,4's,8's as outlines) but fails to fill 5's systematically, instead placing scattered 8's in legend/picture areas (e.g., row 1 cols 26-28 8's where likely blank/5 expected to fill; row 5 col 20 8's isolated vs. expected component fill; row 10 cols 16-21 8's but incomplete, leaving gaps like row 10 col 14 8 missing connections) and leaves many presumed 5's unfilled or mismatched (e.g., row 3 cols 13-19 partial 4's but 5's? implied unfilled; row 23 cols 5-30 heavy 8's but irregular, not matching clean components; overall, 8's appear overfilled or in wrong spots like row 0 cols 9-11, suggesting wrong legend extraction or side). This indicates sep detection succeeded (some structure preserved) but filling side/color assignment failed similarly to training (wrong vertical handling? mismatched colors like 8 overusing); does not match expected clean component fills—likely needs side flip for vertical and better color ordering to handle test's complex layout (multiple components, possible vertical sep).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual coloring puzzle where a grid contains pre-placed color samples (non-zero, non-5 values like 1,2,3,4,6,8 representing distinct colors), blank areas to color (5's forming connected components), and empty space (0's). The grid is implicitly divided by an invisible horizontal or vertical separator into a "legend" side (containing the unique color samples to use for filling) and a "picture" side (containing the 5's to fill via flood-fill on connected components, cycling through the legend's unique colors in the order they appear).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator is not explicitly marked; it must be inferred by evaluating possible horizontal (between rows) or vertical (between columns) cuts that best separate color samples (legend) from blanks (5's in picture), using a heuristic score like (colors on legend side * 5's on picture side) minus a penalty (k=100) for any 5's leaking into the legend side—higher score wins, and if both <0, do nothing.
 * Legend side is chosen as the side with more color samples (non-0, non-5 cells); if tie, the code assumes the side with more colors is legend, but this can fail if colors are unbalanced or if 5's are misclassified.
 * Unique legend colors are extracted in raster order (row-major, left-to-right, top-to-bottom) from the legend side only, deduplicated with a set to get a list like [1,2,3]—subtlety: order matters for cycling, and duplicates in legend shouldn't repeat in the cycle.
 * Picture side's 5's are filled via flood-fill (4-directional connectivity: up/down/left/right) on unvisited connected components, assigning colors from the legend list in sequence (cycle with % len(legend_colors)), starting a new component_id for each; subtlety: components must be fully connected groups of 5's only (not touching pre-colors or 0's), and filling replaces 5's but leaves pre-existing colors and 0's untouched.
 * If no valid separation (scores <0 or no legend colors), return the grid unchanged—easy to miss: this handles cases with no 5's or integrated legend/picture.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but separation index r/c is from 1 to n-1; vertical/horizontal choice prefers the higher score, with horizontal if tie.
 * Subtle edge cases: legend might not span full width/height; 5's might touch the separator or exist on both sides (penalized); pre-colors in picture side should remain (not overwritten); disconnected 5's get sequential colors, not random.
 * Overall: output must exactly match expected by replacing only 5's in picture with cycled legend colors per component, preserving all else—no filling outside picture, no color invention.

    return legend_side_count * picture_fives - k * legend_fives
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it demonstrates core understanding of separation heuristic, legend extraction, and flood-fill, but fails execution on both training examples due to misidentifying legend vs. picture sides or filling the wrong regions.
 * What worked: Separation scoring correctly identifies a potential cut (e.g., horizontal at row 5 in train1, as legend is row6 with all 1's); flood-fill correctly handles connectivity; preserves 0's and pre-colors; cycles colors via % len.
 * What didn't work: In train1, generated fills picture side (below row5) with 1,2,3,4 cycling, but expected has different colors/placements (e.g., row12 col12-13 has 4's in generated but 0's in expected; row13 has 4's where expected has nothing; row16 has 3's misplaced); this suggests wrong legend extraction (includes 4 from below?) or wrong picture range—unknown why, but likely legend_above logic fails as above_colors (rows0-4) has 1,2,3,4 but below has more, flipping sides incorrectly.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly fills upper areas with 1's and misplaces 2's/3's (e.g., row2 col14-23 has 1's but expected 2's; row8 col26-27 has 2's but expected 3's); picture filling leaks into legend or wrong sep_index (likely vertical, but left/right mischosen); component_id cycling starts wrong, overwriting pre-colors subtly.
 * extract_legend_colors (implicit in code) is helpful but broken here—adds colors from wrong side, including duplicates or post-sep leaks.
 * separation_score is helpful and core, but k=100 too aggressive, causing negative scores or wrong best_r/c in unbalanced grids.
 * self_fill is helpful and correct for connectivity, but applied to wrong regions (e.g., fills 5's in legend side accidentally).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but visited matrix init/clear per run could be optimized; no broken types.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills many 5's with 1's (e.g., scattered in cols24-29 across rows0-29, forming vertical strips), but leaves most 5's unfilled or untouched (e.g., large 5-clusters in rows8-16 cols0-23 remain 5's? Wait, output shows some 5's replaced but inconsistently—e.g., row8 col9-12 filled to 5? No, output has 5's persisting in picture areas like row10 col14-18, suggesting incomplete filling or wrong picture side.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulating): Input has pre-colors (1's in col9-11, 8's in left, 6's/4's right/bottom) and 5's scattered; expected should extract legend colors (likely 1,4,6,8 from one side, say left/top), then fill right/bottom 5-components cycling e.g., [1,4,6,8]—but generated over-relies on 1 (only cycles to it?), ignores 8/6/4 in filling, and fills vertically (suggests vertical sep chosen wrong, legend_left=true but left has few colors vs. right 5's); e.g., row2 col14-18 should be one component filled uniform color, but output has mixed/unfilled; bottom row28 has 5's unfilled where expected full color blobs. This mismatches as it doesn't cycle properly and likely picks wrong sep (vertical at low c, making left legend but left has 1's and 5's penalized heavily).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid that represents a visual diagram with a legend of colored shapes (non-zero numbers excluding 5's and possibly background 1's), a separator line (full row or column of 1's dividing legend from picture), and a picture area containing blanks (5's) to be filled. The goal is to fill the 5's in the picture area by assigning colors from the legend's unique shapes/components in a specific order (likely discovery or positional), while preserving the original legend and separator, but the current program incorrectly cycles through legend colors for each connected component of 5's without matching shapes or sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 0 for empty/background, 1 for separators or background components (largest 1-component should be excluded from legend to avoid including the separator itself), 5 for blanks to fill in the picture area, and other numbers (2-8+) for pre-colored shapes in the legend.
 * Separators are full rows ('h') or columns ('v') entirely of 1's; if vertical, determine picture side by comparing number of 5's on left vs. right (picture on side with more or equal 5's).
 * Legend colors are derived from unique colors of connected components (4-directional adjacency, excluding 0,1,5) in discovery order (row-major), skipping the largest 1-component (likely the separator or background).
 * Filling only occurs in the "picture" region (post-separator, respecting side for vertical); non-picture 5's (if any) should remain 5 or be unchanged, but current code assumes all 5's are in picture.
 * Connected components of 5's in the picture should be filled entirely with one color, but assignment must match legend shapes by size/order/position, not just cycle through colors—cycling leads to mismatches where small/large 5-regions get wrong colors.
 * Preserve all original non-5 cells (including legend shapes and separator); output is a copy of input with only picture 5's replaced.
 * Subtle: Components ignore 5's during legend extraction (treat as barriers/non-part), so legend is purely from solid shapes; discovery order matters for legend sequence (sort by label after flood-fill labeling).
 * No separator case: Treat entire grid as picture, fill all 5-components.
 * Edge cases: Uneven number of 5-components vs. legend colors (don't cycle; perhaps repeat or match explicitly); multiple separators (code assumes one); 5's adjacent to legend but not crossing separator.
 * Picture determination for vertical: Use count of 5's to decide left/right, but if equal, current code picks left—may need tiebreaker (e.g., first non-empty).
 * Flood-fill for 5's must respect picture boundaries (in_picture_func) to avoid spilling into legend.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_separator(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    n = len(g)
    # Check for horizontal separator
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            return 'h', r
    # Check for vertical separator
    for c in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
            return 'v', c
    return None, -1
```
(This correctly identifies the single separator row/column of 1's; useful for dividing legend vs. picture.)

```python
def get_picture_left(v_sep_index: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    num_left = sum(1 for r in range(n) for c in range(v_sep_index) if g[r][c] == 5)
    num_right = sum(1 for r in range(n) for c in range(v_sep_index + 1, n) if g[r][c] == 5)
    return num_left >= num_right
```
(This decides picture side for vertical separators by 5-count; correct but may need refinement for ties.)

```python
def find_pre_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    n = len(g)
    label = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    next_label = 1
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if label[i][j] == 0 and g[i][j] != 0 and g[i][j] != 5:
                color = g[i][j]
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                size = 1
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and label[nx][ny] == 0 and g[nx][ny] != 0 and g[nx][ny] != 5:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            size += 1
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, color, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components
```
(This correctly labels and extracts connected components for legend, excluding 0/1/5; size tracking is useful for potential shape matching; 4-dir adjacency is standard.)

```python
def get_legend_colors(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not components:
        return []
    # Find largest color 1 component to exclude
    max_size = 0
    excluded_label = -1
    for lid, col, sz in components:
        if col == 1 and sz > max_size:
            max_size = sz
            excluded_label = lid
    # Build unique colors in discovery order, skipping excluded
    color_set = set()
    legend = []
    # Sort by label to ensure discovery order
    components.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    for lid, col, sz in components:
        if lid != excluded_label and col not in color_set:
            color_set.add(col)
            legend.append(col)
    return legend
```
(This builds legend by unique colors in order, excluding largest 1-component; helpful but may need to include sizes for matching instead of just colors.)

```python
def flood_fill_region(output: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int, in_picture: callable):
    n = len(g)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny] and in_picture(nx, ny):
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This correctly flood-fills connected 5's with a single color, respecting picture boundaries; iterative stack avoids recursion depth issues.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies separators (both train examples preserve the row of 1's at row 5 unchanged).
 * Component extraction works: Legend colors are built in discovery order excluding largest 1 (e.g., train1 legend likely [2,3,4] or similar, applied to picture).
 * Picture side detection works for vertical (though not used in trains, which seem horizontal).
 * Flood-fill only targets picture 5's and preserves non-5's (upper legend and separator unchanged in both trains).
 * Missed shape/size matching: Fills each 5-component with next legend color via cycling (component_id % num_colors), but expected assigns specific colors to match legend shapes (e.g., train1 generated uses 2 in row13 col12-13 where expected has 4; generated row15 has 2's where expected has 4's in a larger blob).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated fills lower-left legend area incorrectly (e.g., row12 col8-9: 4,4 same as expected, but row13 col12-13: 2,2 vs expected 4,4; row14 col9-13:4's vs expected 4's but shifted; row16 col5:3 vs expected 3 same, but row20 col13-16:2's vs expected nothing/0? Wait, actually row20 generated has 2's in col12-15 where expected has nothing, indicating overfill outside picture). Overall, ~20-30% of picture cells wrong colors/sizes.
 * Train2 mismatches: Similar over-cycling; generated row11 col4:2 vs expected nothing (overfill?); row14 col2-8:2's vs expected 2's but wrong position; row20 col11-14:2's vs expected 3's in different area; row23 col4:3 vs expected nothing. Picture blobs get wrong colors (e.g., large bottom 3-blob partially 2 in generated).
 * Function `program` orchestrates well but assignment logic (cycling without matching) is broken—not helpful for core filling; replace with size/order matching.
 * No horizontal/vertical traversal order for 5-discovery affects component_id, leading to wrong sequence (e.g., train1 starts filling from bottom-left 5's, assigning early colors to wrong blobs).
 * Excludes all 1's except via largest, but small 1-blobs might be valid legend if not separator (subtle miss).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to fill some 5's but leaves many as-is or uses wrong colors, and includes fills outside expected picture (e.g., row1 col2-3:6,6 unchanged but surrounded by 0's; row2 col9-11:8,8,8 but test has complex 6/8/4 shapes suggesting legend on left/bottom, picture on right/top?).
 * Fills seem to cycle 1,8,6,4 but mismatch expected replication: e.g., row3 col14-18:4's correct for a horizontal bar, but row4 col13-14,18:4's sparse vs legend's solid 4-blob (row8-9 col0-1:4's small); large 8-blob in row20-29 col9+ gets 8 but interspersed with 0's/6's where should be solid.
 * Overfills non-picture: e.g., row7 col9-11:6,6,6 but if vertical separator at col12 (all 1's? input not shown, but output suggests no clear sep handling); row16 col14-17:8's but may be legend area.
 * Missing full replication: Legend seems to have 6-blob (row2-7 col1-7), 4-blob (row8 col0-1, row18-20 col1-3?), 8-blob (scattered), but picture (right side?) has partial matches only; many 5's (implied in input) remain unfilled or wrong (e.g., row22 col5-9:8's but jagged vs smooth legend).
 * To handle test: Need explicit shape matching (e.g., sort 5-components and legend by size/position, assign matching color); current cycling assigns 1 to thin verticals (row0-29 col24:1's) which may be wrong if 1 is background.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where connected components of placeholder pixels (value 5) represent shapes that must be replaced with digits (1-4) based on the number of internal holes they enclose, using a key derived from patterns in rows 1-3 of the grid. The goal is to identify these components, count their enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the exterior background), map hole counts to digits via the key, fill the component and its holes with the mapped digit, and set unmapped components to 0, while preserving other grid elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid is fixed at 30x30 (H=30, W=30); assume input g is this size, with 0 as background/empty, 5 as placeholders for shapes, and digits 1-4 already placed or to be placed.
 * Shapes are 4-connected components of 5's (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Holes are internal 0-components not reachable from the grid borders (exterior flood-fill from borders marks background 0's); only count hole components adjacent to exactly one shape component (via 4-directions) to avoid shared holes between shapes.
 * Key extraction from rows 1-3: Look for horizontal runs of the same non-0/5 digit in row 1 (length >=3), check if row 3 matches exactly, then count 0's in the corresponding segment of row 2 to get hole_count -> digit mapping (e.g., 0 zeros might map to solid digit, 1 zero to digit with one hole).
 * Replacement: For each shape component, use its hole count to look up the digit in the mapping; if found, replace all 5's in the component and all pixels in its associated hole(s) with the digit; if not found, set the 5's to 0 (but do not touch holes).
 * Subtleties: Mapping is built only from valid key segments (matching rows 1/3, length >=3); multiple keys possible, but assume unique hole counts. Holes must be fully enclosed (no border connection). Adjacency for hole-to-shape is 4-directional and checks comp_id. Preserve existing digits (1-4) and background 0's outside shapes/holes. Components with 0 holes or multiple adjacent holes might default to 0 or need special handling. The key might not cover all hole counts, leading to defaults. In trains, shapes have irregular forms (e.g., not fully filled), so replacement must fill exactly the 5's and holes, not expand. Exterior flood must handle all border 0's, including corners, to correctly identify internals.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly identifies 5-components, marks exterior 0's, finds internal holes, assigns them to single-adjacent shapes, builds a row 1-3 mapping based on 0-counts in row 2, and replaces 5's + holes with mapped digit (or 0 if unmapped).
 * What worked: Component finding via BFS accurately groups 5's; exterior flood-fill correctly identifies background 0's (no leaks in trains); hole finding and single-adjacency check is logically sound; mapping extraction skips short/non-matching segments and uses exact 0-counts.
 * What didn't work: In train 1, generated mismatches expected in multiple shapes—e.g., row 10: generated [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,...] (3's not fully filled, missing hole at col 4); row 11: generated solid 4's vs expected with holes; row 12: generated [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,...] vs expected with holes in 1's area; row 14: generated solid 4's/holes mismatch; lower 2's and 1's have wrong patterns (e.g., row 20: generated solid 3's vs expected with holes; row 21: generated [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,...] but later rows show 2's/1's with incorrect hole placements like solid vs dotted). Reason unknown, but likely overcounting holes or wrong adjacency (e.g., shared/multi-adj holes not handled, or mapping misapplied to wrong count). Train 1 also leaves some 5's as 0 implicitly but shapes are incomplete.
 * In train 2, generated mismatches: row 10: generated [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...] but later rows show 3's with wrong fills (e.g., row 11: generated partial 2's vs expected with holes in 3's; row 15: generated 2's block vs expected with holes; lower 3's in rows 23-27 have solid/missing holes, e.g., row 24: generated [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] but patterns don't match dotted expectations). Likely same issue: incorrect hole assignment or mapping (e.g., treating multi-hole or shared as single, or wrong num0 in key).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding (core component/hole logic), but fails to reproduce exact shapes, suggesting bugs in hole counting (e.g., counting size instead of components? Code counts components via +=1 per hole group, but trains suggest per-pixel or different metric) or adjacency (perhaps holes adjacent to multiple via indirect paths). No unhelpful functions; all provided (BFS, flood, mapping) are essential and mostly correct, but hole assignment may need refinement (e.g., ensure holes are fully enclosed by one shape only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed logic as trains, replacing presumed 5's with 8,6,4 in patterned blocks (e.g., rows 2-6 show 8's with hole-like 0's preserved? No, it fills some but leaves 0's in patterns matching input holes, but digits like 8/6/4 suggest wrong mapping—puzzle likely expects 1-4 only, not higher; right column has solid 1's preserved correctly, but upper 8's block (rows 2-6) has inconsistent fills (e.g., row 2: 8,8,8 at end but 0's elsewhere; row 3: dotted 8's), lower 6's (rows 8-16) are dotted but overfilled in places, and bottom 4's (rows 18-28) similarly dotted but not matching typical 1-4 hole patterns from trains. It mismatches expected puzzle output by using invalid digits (8,6,4 instead of mapping to 1-4) and incomplete fills (e.g., not closing holes properly in 8's/6's/4's blocks), likely due to same hole-counting error—mentally, test input seems to have key in top (implied rows 1-3 with patterns for 1-4), and shapes with 0/1/2 holes, so output should replace with 1-4 in exact input shapes + filled holes, but generated leaves dotted 0's and uses wrong values, indicating mapping failure or misidentification of 5's (test shows 8/6/4/1 already? Wait, input has 8/6/4 as existing? No, generated is post-process, but trains suggest 5's become 1-4; here it seems to treat existing digits as 5's wrongly or mapping pulls wrong values).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a 30x30 grid where connected components of colored pixels (1-4) act as "keys" that encode a mapping based on the number of enclosed zero-spaces (holes) they surround, and components of 5's (placeholders) must be transformed by replacing them with the color from the matching key based on their own hole count. The goal is to correctly identify and map these keys, then apply the transformation to all 5-components without altering other parts of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys are connected components (flood-fill 4-directional adjacency) of the same non-zero, non-5 color; only certain components qualify as keys (in this attempt, those spanning exactly 3 rows vertically, which may be too restrictive and miss horizontal or irregular shapes).
 * The "h" value (hole count) for a component is the number of 0-cells fully enclosed by it (all 4 orthogonal neighbors must be part of the component), but this may overcount or miscount if holes are not fully internal or if boundary conditions are mishandled; subtle issue: enclosure check assumes a closed loop, but may fail for open or partial surrounds.
 * Mapping is from h to the component's color C, but assumes unique h per key; if multiple keys have the same h, it overwrites (last one wins), which could cause errors if duplicates exist.
 * 5-components are transformed uniformly to the mapped color if h matches a key; if no match, defaults to 0 (erasing them), which is likely wrong—expected outputs show 5's becoming specific colors like 1,2,3,4 without erasure.
 * Grid is mostly empty (0's), with patterns resembling letters/numbers (e.g., vertical bars, E-shapes); keys are likely the small, structured patterns (e.g., height-3 verticals in training), while 5's mimic those shapes but need recoloring.
 * Subtle: Components must be exactly connected same-value cells; diagonals don't count. Also, keys exclude 5's and 0's; processing order (keys first, then 5's) is correct but visited tracking prevents reprocessing.
 * Easy to miss: Height check (maxr - minr +1 ==3) works for training vertical keys but fails if keys are wider/shorter; h computation iterates all 0's globally, which is inefficient but correct in principle, but may count holes outside the component if neighbors overlap multiple components.
 * All non-key components (e.g., large blobs) are left unchanged; output is a copy of input with only 5's modified.
 * Considerations from attempts: Flood-fill must handle stack-based DFS correctly to avoid stack overflow on large components (N=30 is small, so fine); h=0 for no holes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    N = 30
    C = g[start_r][start_c]
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(start_r, start_c)]
    component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    visited[start_r][start_c] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == C:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood_fill is correct and essential for extracting connected components of same color; uses DFS stack, marks visited to avoid overlap.)

```python
def compute_h(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    N = 30
    comp_set = set(component)
    h = 0
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if g[i][j] == 0:
                neigh_pos = [(i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in dirs]
                if all(0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and (ni, nj) in comp_set for ni, nj in neigh_pos):
                    h += 1
    return h
```
(This computes enclosed holes by checking if every 0 has all 4 neighbors in the component; helpful but potentially flawed for non-simply-connected shapes—counts any fully surrounded 0, even if not "inside" the intended hole; use set for fast lookup.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies vertical height-3 components as keys and computes h as enclosed 0's, but the height restriction misses non-vertical keys (e.g., in training 1 expected, some 3's and 1's are horizontal or irregular).
 * Mapping works partially (e.g., transforms some 5's to correct colors like 2's in top of training 1), but overwrites or misses due to h mismatches—e.g., in training 1, generated keeps 4's where expected has 3's in rows 9-11 cols 3-5, and places 4's instead of 1's in rows 11-12 cols 20-25.
 * In training 1, generated has 4's in a scattered pattern (e.g., row 9 col 9-11, row 10 col 2-3,8-11) where expected has 3's there and shifts 1's/4's elsewhere; unknown why h computation mismatches, possibly because enclosure check counts global 0's incorrectly for those components.
 * In training 2, generated places 2's in large blobs (e.g., rows 14-16 cols 12-29) where expected has 3's, and misses 3's in bottom (e.g., row 9 col 26-27 generated 2's, expected 3's); also generates extra 2's in row 8 cols 24-25 where expected 0's.
 * transform_fives correctly applies mapping to 5-components via flood-fill, but defaults to 0 on no match, which erases some 5's incorrectly (e.g., training 1 row 17 has generated 0's where expected 1's/3's).
 * identify_keys skips components without height==3, causing misses (e.g., training 2 has wider 3-key at bottom, not detected).
 * Overall, h computation seems to work for simple vertical keys (e.g., top 1,2,3,4 in training 1 match), but fails for complex shapes; no unhelpful functions—all are relevant, but height filter is broken for generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places vertical columns of 1's (e.g., col 24 rows 0-29) where input likely has empty or other patterns, suggesting over-transformation or misdetection of keys as 1's.
 * Patterns of 8,6,4 appear in blocks (e.g., rows 1-6 cols 26-28 as 8's with gaps mimicking E-shape, rows 7-16 cols 26-28 as 6's, rows 17-28 cols 26-28 as 4's), which seem to directly copy input 5-shapes but recolor them sequentially (8→6→4), but this doesn't match training logic—likely wrong because training expected specific recolors (1-4) based on holes, not arbitrary 4/6/8; 8 and 6 aren't in expected colors (only 1-4), so mapping is inventing invalid colors.
 * Missing transformations: Input test (inferred from output) has repeated vertical E-like 5's, but output doesn't match hole-based logic (e.g., all get different colors without clear h-variation); erases some to 0's incorrectly, similar to training defaults.
 * Does not make sense: If keys have h mapping to 1-4, output shouldn't produce 6/8; likely h miscomputed for test keys, or no keys detected, falling back to wrong defaults—needs better key identification beyond height=3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where connected components of cells valued at 5 (likely representing uncolored "blobs" or regions) must be identified and recolored with integers 1-4 such that no two adjacent components (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-connectivity rules; the rest of the grid (non-5 cells) remains unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid matching this coloring scheme, possibly with a preference for higher colors (e.g., starting assignments from 4 downward) to match specific expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and only cells with exactly 5 are considered for component extraction—other values like 0,1,2,3,4,6,8 must be preserved as-is in the output.
 * Adjacency for coloring is also 4-directional and only between different components (i.e., if two 5-cells from different components touch, their colors must differ; same-component cells get the same color).
 * Coloring is greedy but order-sensitive: the current implementation assigns colors starting from the highest (4 down to 1) based on forbidden colors from already-colored neighbors, but this order-of-discovery (row-major scanning) leads to mismatches—expected outputs suggest a need for a different traversal order, canonical labeling (e.g., by size, position, or min coordinates), or possibly a full graph coloring algorithm that minimizes colors or follows a specific priority.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous or nested/irregularly shaped, and small isolated components (size 1+) must be handled; the min_r/min_c in components tracking seems intended for sorting/ordering but isn't used effectively for coloring decisions.
 * Preserve all non-5 values exactly (e.g., input 1s stay 1, 8s stay 8); the output should never introduce values outside 1-4 for former 5s or alter existing numbers.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no 5s should return unchanged; large components spanning the grid; potential for 4+ colors needed but since graph is planar-ish, 4 should suffice.
 * The puzzle likely simulates "region coloring" like in maps or Nonogram-style puzzles, where visual separation (no same-color adjacencies) is key—mismatches often occur in complex interlocked regions where greedy fails to match expected "minimal" or "preferred" colorings.
 * Important: Labeling must be unique per component (next_label increments correctly), and adjacency building removes duplicates, but the coloring loop processes labels in discovery order (1 to num_labels), which may not align with expected color priorities (e.g., larger components or top-left first might need precedence).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for preserving the input grid while modifying only 5s.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]], List[List[int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return [], [[0]]
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    label = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    next_label = 1
    components = []
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 5 and label[i][j] == 0:
                size = 0
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                min_r, min_c = i, j
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    size += 1
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] == 5 and label[nx][ny] == 0:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, min_r, min_c, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components, label
```
(This BFS-based component finder with labeling and min position/size tracking is solid and correctly identifies 4-connected 5-components; it's essential for extraction and could be extended by sorting components e.g., by (min_r, min_c) for consistent ordering.)

```python
def build_adjacency(label: List[List[int]], num_labels: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(label), len(label[0])
    adj = [[] for _ in range(num_labels + 1)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if label[i][j] > 0:
                l = label[i][j]
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and label[ni][nj] > 0 and label[ni][nj] != l:
                        adj[l].append(label[ni][nj])
    for i in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```
(This builds an undirected graph of component adjacencies correctly by scanning labeled grid edges and deduplicating neighbors; very helpful for modeling the coloring constraint graph.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, which correctly implements connected component labeling via BFS and builds an adjacency graph, but fails in the greedy coloring step due to processing labels in discovery order (leading to suboptimal or mismatched color assignments compared to expected).
 * What worked: Component extraction accurately identifies and labels separate 5-regions (e.g., in training 1, the top 1/2/3/4 blobs are split correctly); adjacency detection catches edge-sharing between components; grid copying preserves non-5s.
 * What didn't work: The assign_colors function uses a simple greedy approach (highest available color 4-to-1) in label order, but expected outputs use different assignments—e.g., in training 1, generated uses all 4 for a large bottom-left blob where expected splits it into 3 and 1; in training 2, generated merges or miscolors a sprawling 2-region into 4s. This suggests the need to sort components (e.g., by size descending or position) before coloring, or use a different strategy like smallest degree last or exact matching to expected priorities.
 * In training 1: Generated mismatches in rows 9-29, e.g., row 9 has 4,4,4 where expected has 3,3,3; row 11 has 4s where expected has 1s; row 14 has scattered 4s/1s differently; unknown why, but likely due to coloring order causing a chain reaction in interlocked regions.
 * In training 2: Mismatches in rows 1-29, e.g., row 1 has 4,4 where expected has 2,2; row 8 has 4s where expected has 2s; row 9 has 2s where expected has 3s; again, greedy order fails on complex topologies.
 * The main program ties it together well but doesn't sort components or adjust coloring for expected patterns—min_r/min_c/size are computed but unused beyond appending.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (copy_grid, find_components, build_adjacency, assign_colors) are relevant, though assign_colors needs fixing (e.g., sort labels by component size or position before coloring loop).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it introduces or preserves values like 8 and 6 (e.g., in rows 1-6 and 7-16), which are likely from the input grid and unchanged (correct behavior), but the coloring of 5s results in 1 and 4 mostly, with patterns that seem arbitrary (e.g., a large 4-blob in rows 2-6 cols 1-8, isolated 1s in col 24); however, without the expected test output, it's hard to confirm, but it doesn't match the structured 1-4 colorings in training expecteds and includes 8/6 which may indicate the input has pre-colored elements that interact poorly.
 * Issues: Scattered 1s in col 24 across many rows suggest small components colored low, but expected might group them differently; the 4-heavy upper left doesn't align with training expecteds' balanced use of 1-3; potential over-reliance on discovery order causes inconsistent coloring (e.g., why col 26-28 get 8s—probably input, but if 5s there, coloring failed); overall, it looks like partial component detection but wrong color propagation, similar to training failures—does not make sense as a valid 4-coloring without verifying adjacencies mentally (e.g., adjacent 4s from different components would violate rules).
 * To handle test: Ensure coloring accounts for pre-existing colors? No, program ignores them for forbidden sets, which might be wrong if puzzle treats all non-0 as "colored" already; also, sort components by (min_r, min_c) or size to match expected order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where a legend of colored shapes (non-orange, spanning specific rows) with varying hole counts defines a mapping from hole numbers to colors, which is then used to recolor orange (5) shapes elsewhere in the grid based on their own hole counts (replacing with the mapped color or 0 if unmapped); the goal is to transform the entire grid accordingly while preserving non-relevant elements like dividers or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legend components must be non-5 colors and exactly span rows 1-3 (0-indexed), identified sequentially by hole count h matching their left-to-right position (expected_h starting at 0 and incrementing only on match; stop building on mismatch to handle incomplete/invalid legends).
 * Holes are 4-connected components of 0-cells fully enclosed within a shape's bounding box (min_r to max_r, min_c to max_c), specifically those not reachable via flood-fill from the bounding box's boundary 0-cells (background 0's are boundary-connected, holes are the remaining disconnected 0-CCs inside).
 * Orange (5) shapes are transformed component-by-component: compute their hole count h using the same bounding-box enclosure logic, then replace all cells in the component with legend[h] if it exists, else 0 (effectively removing unmapped shapes).
 * Grid is square (n x n), backgrounds are 0, shapes are solid connected components of the same non-0 color (4-connected adjacency).
 * Subtlety: Hole computation is local to each shape's bounding box to isolate internal enclosures, ignoring global connectivity or outside 0's; this prevents overcounting or undercounting due to adjacent shapes or grid edges.
 * Dividers (e.g., vertical bars of 1's) are not transformed and should remain as-is, as they are likely non-legend, non-orange components.
 * Legend building stops on mismatch to avoid incorrect mappings if the puzzle has validation (e.g., if a shape in position doesn't have the expected holes, don't use later ones).
 * Only transform orange components; other colors (including legend shapes) stay unchanged.
 * Edge case: Empty components or no holes yield 0; legend may be incomplete, leading to some oranges becoming 0.
 * Visually, shapes like letters (e.g., 'B' with 2 holes, 'A' with 1) are common, so hole counting must handle multi-hole enclosures correctly via separate CCs in remaining 0's.
 * Bounding box includes only the shape's extent, but hole flood-fill is constrained to it to define "enclosed."

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood_fill_to_find_component(grid: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], sr: int, sc: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """
    Standard 4-connected flood-fill to extract a component of the same color, marking visited.
    Useful for identifying shapes and their cells.

    pass  # Full code in attempt
```

```python
def compute_holes(grid: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """
    Computes enclosed holes: flood-fills background 0's from bounding box boundary, then counts disconnected 0-CCs in the remaining bbox cells.

    """
    # (Implementation as in provided: finds bbox, starts from boundary 0's, floods background, then CCs on inner 0's)
    pass  # Full code in attempt; handles empty comp as 0
```

```python
def compute_min_max_r(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:

    """
    # (Implementation as in provided: uses visited, flood-fill, checks row span, sequential h validation)
    pass
```

```python
def transform_orange_shapes(grid: List[List[int]], legend: dict[int, int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """

    """
    # (Implementation as in provided: copies grid, uses new_grid for replacement to avoid interfering with flood-fill)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of legend extraction, hole counting via bbox isolation, and orange transformation.
 * What worked: Accurate component detection with flood-fill; correct bbox-based hole logic that distinguishes enclosed vs. boundary 0's; sequential legend building with mismatch stopping; in-place transformation on a grid copy to preserve structure.
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test fully correct (see below), but no explicit failures noted; potential subtlety missed if legend shapes have internal structure affecting bbox (e.g., if they don't perfectly span cols, but code doesn't check col span).
 * Function `compute_min_max_r` is helpful but limited (only rows; cols computed inline elsewhere—could consolidate to full bbox util).
 * All provided functions (flood_fill, compute_holes, etc.) are relevant and working for the puzzle; no unhelpful or broken ones identified here, though future attempts should validate against edge cases like touching shapes or irregular bboxes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output appears mostly correct and makes sense based on puzzle rules: it shows a 30x30 grid with a vertical divider of 1's in column 24 (unchanged, as expected for non-orange/non-legend); transformed shapes of 8's (rows ~1-5, likely 2-hole 'B'-like, mapped from legend), 6's (rows ~7-16, possibly 1-hole or 0-hole patterns), and 4's (rows ~17-28, similar); gaps (all 0's) between sections preserved; top/bottom rows fully 0 except divider.
 * Observed effects: Patterns like [1,0,8,8,8,0] repeating suggest letter-like shapes with holes replaced correctly (e.g., 8's have internal 0's not transformed); no 5's remain, indicating all oranges processed; legend likely built from top (rows 1-3) with h=0,1,2,... mapping to 4,6,8 or similar.
 * Differences from expected: Hard to confirm without input grid, but output lacks any 5's or unmapped remnants (good); however, the 8/6/4 patterns repeat vertically more than typical (e.g., 8's in 3-row blocks x2 with gaps?), which might indicate over-transformation or legend misread if input had stacked oranges—possibly correct if input had multi-component oranges, but could be incorrect if legend h didn't match (e.g., if a shape has 3 holes but legend only to 2, should be 0 not 4/6/8). The long vertical spans for 6's/4's (8+ rows) suggest either tall shapes or multiple adjacent components merged incorrectly, differing from compact legend expectation—may need tighter component validation. Overall, it aligns with rules but feels elongated; unsure if exact match without input, but no obvious errors like leftover 5's or wrong colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 20:47:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into a legend section (showing colored shapes with specific hole counts) and a picture section (with unshaded areas marked as 5's), separated by a full line of 1's (horizontal or vertical). The goal is to replace the 5's in the picture with colors from the legend by matching the number of enclosed holes (0's) in connected components of the same color/size >=5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator is a complete row or column of all 1's; if horizontal, legend is above and picture below; if vertical, determine legend vs. picture by checking which side has no 5's (legend side) or by hole-based mapping logic.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-zero/non-1/non-5 value, with size at least 5 cells; ignore isolated cells or small groups.
 * Holes are fully enclosed 0's within the bounding box of a component; the hole-counting flood-fill starts from boundaries but must correctly identify interior disconnected 0-regions as separate holes—current implementation mixes boundary seeding with interior counting, leading to under/over-counting.
 * Mapping is from hole count in legend components to their color value; if no match, leave as 5 or default; picture components of 5's get their holes computed and filled with matching legend color.
 * Subtleties: Vertical separators require swapping legend/picture if the right side has no 5's (indicating picture on left); bounding boxes for holes must be tight (min/max row/col of component) but flood-fill only within that box; 0's on boundaries aren't holes; components can't span the separator; the grid may have empty rows/columns of 0's as padding.
 * Easy to miss: Legend components can have 0 holes; multiple components can map to same hole count (use last or first?); picture 5-components may touch edges or be irregular; 1's in legend/picture are barriers, not fillable; output copies input but only replaces 5's in picture.
 * All 0's, 1's, and non-picture areas remain unchanged; only picture 5's are replaced.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core structure works: correctly identifies horizontal separator in training 1 (row 5 all 1's), vertical in training 2; finds legend components (e.g., 2,3,4 in train1 legend) and picture 5's.
 * Hole mapping partially works: in train1, some 0-hole shapes (like solid 4's) map correctly, but fails to fill certain 5-components with 1's or 2's (e.g., row 11-16 in picture keeps 5's instead of filling with 1's based on 1-hole match).
 * Component finding works for large groups but skips small ones correctly; area separation works for horizontal but vertical logic in train2 misassigns sides, leading to wrong legend (fills picture with wrong colors like keeping 5's in rows 2-6 cols 14+).
 * Hole computation is broken: undercounts or miscounts enclosures (e.g., in train1, a 5-component with 1 hole gets mapped wrong, filling with 5 instead of 1; unknown why boundary seeding floods interiors incorrectly); doesn't handle touching-edge holes or irregular shapes well.
 * Output copies grid correctly but only replaces some 5's, leaving others (e.g., train1 row12 col21-25 stays 5 instead of 1); no handling for multiple legend entries with same holes (overwrites mapping).
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in picture area—e.g., rows 11-16 cols 20+ have 5's where expected has 1's (a 1-hole shape unfilled); rows 19-25 cols 24+ have 5's instead of 1's/2's; legend unchanged correctly, but overall incomplete filling.
 * Train2: Mismatches in vertical setup—generated fills some 5's with 2's incorrectly (rows 2-6 cols 14-23 stay 5 or wrong), and picture areas like rows 9-29 cols 20+ keep 5's or fill wrong (e.g., expected 3's in rows 20-29 cols 20+ but generated has scattered 5's/3's); unknown why vertical side swap fails.
 * Function `compute_holes` is broken (incorrect flood-fill logic leads to wrong counts, e.g., counts boundary 0's as holes sometimes); not helpful as-is—needs fix for true enclosure detection.
 * `find_components_in_area` is helpful and correct for extracting blobs, essential for both legend and picture.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond `compute_holes`; overall program understands separation/mapping but fails on hole accuracy and vertical cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have identified a vertical separator (likely col 24 all 1's) and filled some 5's (e.g., rows 0-6 cols 0-8 with 8's, rows 8-16 cols 24-29 with 6's), but leaves many 5's unfilled (e.g., rows 17-29 cols 0-4 stay 5's, should be matched to legend colors like 4's based on holes) and introduces wrong fills (e.g., row 20 cols 10-19 has 4's but scattered, not matching expected solid shapes; row 8 col 0 has 5 where legend shouldn't have 5's).
 * Missing consistent hole-based filling: e.g., upper-left 5's (rows 0-1 cols 9-11) stay 5 or partial, but should map to a legend color (possibly 8 or other based on 0/1 holes); lower picture (rows 17+) has partial 4's but ignores enclosure matches, leaving holes unfilled.
 * Does not make sense overall—scattered numbers like 8's in legend area (rows 0-6 cols 2-7) suggest wrong area assignment or component bleed; expects cleaner replacement of all picture 5's with legend colors (e.g., 4,6 patterns matching hole counts from upper legend), but current has remnants and mismatches; account for potential multiple legends or edge-touching components to handle test.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect each other in every case, without speculation or forcing non-evident links. Only orange shapes show transformations; other elements (e.g., non-orange shapes) remain static. No position-based movement or transformation is observed (bounding boxes and pixel counts are preserved where applicable). Interactions involving test inputs cannot be verified for consistency without outputs, so they are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact visual grid layout or why specific examples appear in top rows) are noted as such but not explained.

1. **Hole count of orange shapes interacts with hole counts of example shapes to determine color transformation**:
   - Example shapes (non-orange, typically small and positioned in initial/top rows with distinct hole counts: e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3 in Train 1; 0, 1 in Train 2) provide a mapping of hole count to color.
   - If an orange shape's hole count exactly matches an example shape's hole count, the orange shape's color changes to the matching example's color.
   - This is consistent: In Train 1, orange holes=0 → yellow (matching example yellow holes=0); holes=1 → green; holes=2 → blue; holes=3 → red. In Train 2, orange holes=0 → red (matching example red holes=0); holes=1 → green.
   - No interaction if no matching example hole count (see omission below).

2. **Hole count of orange shapes interacts with example shapes to adjust output holes**:
   - Upon color transformation (per above), the orange shape's holes are set to the value of the matching example's holes (which equals the original hole count in observed cases).
   - This is consistent: Transformed shapes in both trains output with holes equal to their input holes (e.g., orange holes=2 → blue holes=2 in Train 1; orange holes=1 → green holes=1 in Train 2).
   - Effect is deterministic and tied to the color mapping interaction.

3. **Unmatched hole count in orange shapes leads to omission (no transformation or inclusion in output)**:
   - Orange shapes whose hole count has no matching example are entirely omitted from the output (no color change, no position preservation).
   - This is consistent: In Train 1, orange holes=4 omitted (no example for 4). In Train 2, orange holes=2 omitted (no example for 2). Bounding box and pixels are not preserved because the shape is removed.
   - Unknown: Why higher hole counts (e.g., 4 or 5 in tests) might interact differently if examples were provided, but no evidence in trains.

4. **Color and holes of non-orange shapes have no interaction (remain unchanged)**:
   - Non-orange shapes (e.g., initial yellow/green/blue/red in Train 1; red/green/blue in Train 2) retain their exact color, holes, bounding box, and pixels in the output.
   - This is consistent across both trains: No transformations observed, regardless of position or hole count. They serve as static "examples" but do not affect each other or undergo changes.
   - No connection to orange shapes beyond providing the mapping in interaction 1.

5. **Bounding box (position) of transformed orange shapes is preserved from input to output**:
   - For orange shapes that undergo color/holes transformation (per 1-2), the bounding box remains identical.
   - This is consistent: E.g., in Train 1, orange [17,11,25,16] → blue [17,11,25,16]; in Train 2, orange [19,8,28,15] → green [19,8,28,15].
   - No effect on transformation (position does not cause or alter color/holes changes); it is passively preserved. Omitted shapes (per 3) lose this preservation.

6. **Pixel count of transformed orange shapes is preserved from input to output**:
   - Similar to bounding box: For transformed oranges, pixels remain unchanged.
   - This is consistent: E.g., in Train 1, orange pixels=31 → blue pixels=31; in Train 2, orange pixels=46 → green pixels=46.
   - No causal effect (pixels do not influence color/holes or vice versa); purely static preservation. Omitted shapes lose this.

### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded per Instructions)
- No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., no evidence of one color affecting another's transformation across both trains).
- No position-to-transformation effects (e.g., bbox coordinates do not alter color, holes, or inclusion; only preserved passively).
- No shape silhouette/edge/hole count interactions beyond the color mapping for oranges (e.g., no consistent "nesting" or void effects on movement).
- No background/border or vertical strip interactions (mentioned in description but not evident in data lists; inconsistent or irrelevant).
- Elements like the blue line/shape ([0,5,29,5] in Train 1; [0,0,9,6] or [5,0,5,29] in Train 2) are non-orange and unchanged, with no observed connections to others.
- Higher hole counts (e.g., 4+ in tests) or non-standard colors (e.g., maroon, pink) show no interactions in trains, so unknown if they follow the same mapping.
- No total solution or high-level rule inferred; only pairwise property effects listed.

[2025-10-03 20:48:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a puzzle involving the identification and 4-coloring (using values 1-4) of distinct connected regions (blobs or components) in a grid where cells with values >=5 represent "filled" or "land" areas, and 0 represents empty space. The goal is to assign colors to these regions such that no two adjacent regions (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-color theorem principles for map coloring, while preserving the original 0s and ensuring the output grid reflects properly separated and colored regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), based on cells >=5 being grouped into components via flood-fill or BFS/DFS.
 * Coloring must ensure adjacent regions (i.e., components that touch edge-to-edge) get different colors from {1,2,3,4}; sequential modulo-4 assignment fails because it doesn't check adjacency and can assign the same color to neighbors.
 * Preserve exact shapes of regions: output must match input connectivity for >=5 cells, replacing them with colors but keeping 0s unchanged; subtle patterns like stripes, isolated cells, or irregular blobs must be respected without merging or splitting.
 * Input grids likely have values >=5 as uniform "filled" (ignoring exact value beyond threshold), but outputs show structured patterns (e.g., horizontal/vertical stripes in top of train1, clustered blobs in lower areas), suggesting regions are predefined shapes that need proper separation.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components: each gets a unique color relative to its neighbors; global sequential labeling ignores graph structure (adjacency graph of components).
 * Empty rows/columns of 0s act as separators; do not color them.
 * Subtle: Some regions in expected outputs appear to be single cells or small groups (e.g., isolated 1s or 3s), while others are larger; the program over-labels large areas uniformly but fails on color conflicts.
 * Threshold >=5 is key for identifying filled cells; cells <5 (likely 0-4) stay as-is or are treated as empty, but in outputs, low numbers like 1-4 are colors, so inputs probably use high values only for filled.
 * Potential for odd-shaped adjacencies: regions can interlock or touch at edges without sharing cells, requiring adjacency check post-component extraction.
 * All training examples show patterned regions (e.g., train1 has cross-like or barred patterns in colors 1-4), implying the puzzle may involve recognizing or enforcing specific topologies like non-overlapping territories.

    # Remove duplicates

        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies connected components using BFS flood-fill for cells >=5, which works for extracting region shapes (e.g., top rows in train1 match expected patterns for 4,3,1,2 regions).
 * However, it fails on coloring: assigns colors via (label-1) % 4 + 1, which is sequential and ignores adjacency, leading to same-color adjacent regions (e.g., in train1 lower sections, generated has mismatched 1,2,3,4 placements like row9 having 1s where expected has 4s, and row11 having 3s vs expected 1s; unknown why shapes differ slightly in lower blobs, possibly due to over-merging or incorrect labeling start).
 * Train1 generated matches expected exactly in rows 1-3 (patterned 4,3,1,2 stripes) and row5 (all 1s? wait, generated row5 all 0s but expected row5 all 0s, row6 all 1s matches), but diverges in rows 8+ (e.g., generated row9 has 0,0,0,2,2,2,0... with 1s misplaced; expected has 0s, then 4s in row8; generated incorrectly labels small blobs as continuing prior colors).
 * Train2 generated matches top rows partially (2,3,1 patterns), but mismatches in mid-sections (e.g., row2 has 1s where expected has 2s in a cluster; row10 has 3s where expected has 2s), and lower areas like row23 have scattered 3s/4s vs expected structured 3s.
 * No samples pass, indicating core issue is lack of graph coloring; sequential mod-4 is broken for adjacency conflicts.
 * The labeling function is helpful for extraction but insufficient alone; needs adjacency detection and greedy/backtracking coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the direct output assignment in the attempt (without saving components first) makes debugging hard; future attempts should separate extraction from coloring.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows fragmented and inconsistent coloring (e.g., row0 has isolated 1s, row2 has a large 2-blob with embedded 4s that seem adjacent to same-color areas, row20 has a sprawling 3-blob touching what looks like same-color 3s nearby without separation).
 * It appears to apply the same flawed sequential labeling, resulting in adjacent same-colors (e.g., multiple 1-blobs touching in rows 4-6 without differentiation; 4s in row22-29 form irregular shapes that likely conflict with neighbors like 3s in row18-20).
 * Patterns suggest over-merging or incorrect component boundaries (e.g., row9-16 have 2s and 4s intermingled in ways that don't form clean regions, unlike expected structured blobs in training); it misses the need for proper 4-coloring to avoid conflicts, leading to a noisy, non-map-like output.
 * To handle test case, must build an adjacency graph post-labeling and assign colors greedily (e.g., try 1-4 for each component, avoiding neighbors' colors); test seems to have more interlocking regions (e.g., 1s and 3s alternating but failing), so account for complex topologies.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based coloring puzzle (30x30) divided by a full separator line of 1's (horizontal row or vertical column) into a "legend" side (with pre-colored shapes indicating available colors) and a "picture" side (with outlines in various numbers and blank regions marked as 5's to be filled). The goal is to identify connected components of 5's on the picture side via flood fill and assign colors from the legend's unique colors (excluding 0 and 5), likely in a specific order such as cycling by component discovery or matching by shape/size/position, while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator must be a complete row or column entirely filled with 1's; prioritize horizontal search first, then vertical if none found—missing this leads to no separation and no filling.
 * Legend side extraction: Scan the designated legend area (e.g., above horizontal sep or right of vertical sep) row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to collect unique colors !=0 and !=5 in the order they first appear; this order seems critical for assignment, but simply cycling by discovery order fails as it mismatches expected color placements.
 * Picture side filling: Only fill connected components of 5's (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) using flood fill; components must be discovered in row-major order starting from the picture area (e.g., below horizontal sep or left of vertical sep); do not fill non-5 cells or cross boundaries.
 * Side orientation subtlety: For horizontal sep, legend is typically above (rows 0 to sep-1), picture below (rows sep+1 to end); for vertical sep, the code assumes legend right (cols sep+1 to end), picture left (cols 0 to sep-1), but this may be inverted in some cases (e.g., legend left, picture right), causing unfilled 5's or filling the wrong side—check which side has pre-colors vs. 5's.
 * Color assignment nuance: Not arbitrary cycling; expected outputs suggest assignment by component order (row-major discovery) but with legend colors in strict appearance order, or possibly matching components to legend shapes by size, position, or sequence—cycling works partially but leads to color swaps (e.g., 2 where 4 expected).
 * Grid boundaries: n=30 fixed; output starts as copy of input, only modify 5's in picture side; 0's are empty/background, other numbers are fixed outlines/colors—do not overwrite them.
 * Edge cases: No sep means return unchanged grid; empty legend (no colors) means no filling; multiple components may exceed legend colors, requiring cycling, but order matters; 5's may be isolated or large blobs; vertical seps may not stretch full height if code assumes they do.
 * Scanning order: All discovery (colors, components) must be consistent row-major to match expectations; stack-based flood fill is correct but ensure visited prevents overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Legend may have 5's (ignore them); components cannot cross sep (1's block); if sep not found or wrong side, 5's remain unfilled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_separator(n: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    # Finds horizontal (h) or vertical (v) full line of 1's; returns type and index, or None/-1
    sep_type = None
    sep_index = -1
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            sep_type = 'h'
            sep_index = r
            break
    if sep_type is None:
        for c in range(n):
            if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
                sep_type = 'v'
                sep_index = c
                break
    return sep_type, sep_index
```
(This works well for sep detection, as seen in partial matches in training outputs.)

```python
def extract_legend_colors(n: int, g: List[List[int]], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts unique non-0/non-5 colors from legend side in row-major order
    legend_colors = []
    seen = set()
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index):
            for c in range(n):
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index + 1, n):  # Assumes legend right; may need flip to range(sep_index)
                col = g[r][c]
                if col != 0 and col != 5 and col not in seen:
                    seen.add(col)
                    legend_colors.append(col)
    return legend_colors
```
(This is helpful for color collection but may need side flip for vertical; order is key but simplistic uniqueness misses shape-based ordering.)

```python
def self_fill(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], color: int, sr: int, sc: int, directions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    # Stack-based flood fill for 5's only; marks visited and sets output to color
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This flood fill is correct and essential; prevents overfill and handles components accurately; directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)].)

```python
def color_picture_side(n: int, g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], legend_colors: List[int], sep_type: str, sep_index: int) -> None:
    # Discovers and fills components in row-major order on picture side, cycling colors
    if not legend_colors:
        return
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component_id = 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    if sep_type == 'h':
        for r in range(sep_index + 1, n):
            for c in range(n):
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
    elif sep_type == 'v':
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(sep_index):  # Assumes picture left; may need flip to range(sep_index + 1, n)
                if g[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                    color = legend_colors[component_id % len(legend_colors)]
                    self_fill(n, g, output, visited, color, r, c, directions)
                    component_id += 1
```
(This is mostly helpful for component discovery but fails on color cycling/order and potential side flip; row-major scan is good.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly detects the horizontal separator in training example 1 (top legend intact, bottom filling attempted) and copies the input grid unchanged where appropriate, but fails to assign correct colors to components (e.g., uses [4,3,1,2] cycling, resulting in 2's where expected 4's in row 12 cols 12-13, 3's where 2's in row 20, and mismatches in rows 13-16/22-29; specific differences: generated row 12 has 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs. expected 4,4; row 13 has 2,2,2,2 at cols 9-12 vs. expected 4's shifted; row 17 has 3 at col 5 vs. expected nothing/0 there but 3's elsewhere).
 * For training example 2 (likely vertical sep), sep detection may succeed but side assignment is wrong (assumes legend right/picture left, but expected fills suggest legend left/picture right with 2's and 3's); many 5's remain unfilled (e.g., generated row 2 cols 14-23 are all 5's vs. expected 2's; row 4 cols 13-25 5's vs. expected 2's; row 9 cols 10-12 5's vs. expected 2's; row 20 cols 20-24 5's vs. expected 3's), and some left-side filling occurs incorrectly with 2,3,1 (e.g., row 1 cols 1-3 2's match but cols 19-20 5's unfilled vs. expected 2's).
 * Color cycling by component_id % len(legend_colors) works partially for small components but mismatches sequence (e.g., ex1 first bottom component gets 4 in generated but expected implies different start like 3 or shape-matching); unknown why exact order fails, possibly needs legend shape extraction/matching by size or position rather than scan order.
 * extract_legend_colors collects correctly for horizontal (e.g., ex1 gets [4,3,1,2]) but may collect from wrong side for vertical (ex2 legend likely left, leading to empty or wrong colors, causing no/minimal filling).
 * find_separator is reliable (no false negatives in outputs) but doesn't handle potential multiple seps or partial lines.
 * self_fill is accurate (no overfills or leaks in generated outputs) and essential for components.
 * Overall program structure (copy input, find sep, extract, fill) demonstrates core understanding but breaks on vertical orientation, color ordering, and possibly component-to-color mapping; no handling for no-sep case beyond return (but ex2 suggests sep exists); unhelpful: no shape/size matching function (needed?); visited is per-run only, correct but could miss global 5's if side wrong.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains most input numbers (e.g., 6's,4's,8's as outlines) but fails to fill 5's systematically, instead placing scattered 8's in legend/picture areas (e.g., row 1 cols 26-28 8's where likely blank/5 expected to fill; row 5 col 20 8's isolated vs. expected component fill; row 10 cols 16-21 8's but incomplete, leaving gaps like row 10 col 14 8 missing connections) and leaves many presumed 5's unfilled or mismatched (e.g., row 3 cols 13-19 partial 4's but 5's? implied unfilled; row 23 cols 5-30 heavy 8's but irregular, not matching clean components; overall, 8's appear overfilled or in wrong spots like row 0 cols 9-11, suggesting wrong legend extraction or side). This indicates sep detection succeeded (some structure preserved) but filling side/color assignment failed similarly to training (wrong vertical handling? mismatched colors like 8 overusing); does not match expected clean component fills—likely needs side flip for vertical and better color ordering to handle test's complex layout (multiple components, possible vertical sep).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual coloring puzzle where a grid contains pre-placed color samples (non-zero, non-5 values like 1,2,3,4,6,8 representing distinct colors), blank areas to color (5's forming connected components), and empty space (0's). The grid is implicitly divided by an invisible horizontal or vertical separator into a "legend" side (containing the unique color samples to use for filling) and a "picture" side (containing the 5's to fill via flood-fill on connected components, cycling through the legend's unique colors in the order they appear).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator is not explicitly marked; it must be inferred by evaluating possible horizontal (between rows) or vertical (between columns) cuts that best separate color samples (legend) from blanks (5's in picture), using a heuristic score like (colors on legend side * 5's on picture side) minus a penalty (k=100) for any 5's leaking into the legend side—higher score wins, and if both <0, do nothing.
 * Legend side is chosen as the side with more color samples (non-0, non-5 cells); if tie, the code assumes the side with more colors is legend, but this can fail if colors are unbalanced or if 5's are misclassified.
 * Unique legend colors are extracted in raster order (row-major, left-to-right, top-to-bottom) from the legend side only, deduplicated with a set to get a list like [1,2,3]—subtlety: order matters for cycling, and duplicates in legend shouldn't repeat in the cycle.
 * Picture side's 5's are filled via flood-fill (4-directional connectivity: up/down/left/right) on unvisited connected components, assigning colors from the legend list in sequence (cycle with % len(legend_colors)), starting a new component_id for each; subtlety: components must be fully connected groups of 5's only (not touching pre-colors or 0's), and filling replaces 5's but leaves pre-existing colors and 0's untouched.
 * If no valid separation (scores <0 or no legend colors), return the grid unchanged—easy to miss: this handles cases with no 5's or integrated legend/picture.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but separation index r/c is from 1 to n-1; vertical/horizontal choice prefers the higher score, with horizontal if tie.
 * Subtle edge cases: legend might not span full width/height; 5's might touch the separator or exist on both sides (penalized); pre-colors in picture side should remain (not overwritten); disconnected 5's get sequential colors, not random.
 * Overall: output must exactly match expected by replacing only 5's in picture with cycled legend colors per component, preserving all else—no filling outside picture, no color invention.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it demonstrates core understanding of separation heuristic, legend extraction, and flood-fill, but fails execution on both training examples due to misidentifying legend vs. picture sides or filling the wrong regions.
 * What worked: Separation scoring correctly identifies a potential cut (e.g., horizontal at row 5 in train1, as legend is row6 with all 1's); flood-fill correctly handles connectivity; preserves 0's and pre-colors; cycles colors via % len.
 * What didn't work: In train1, generated fills picture side (below row5) with 1,2,3,4 cycling, but expected has different colors/placements (e.g., row12 col12-13 has 4's in generated but 0's in expected; row13 has 4's where expected has nothing; row16 has 3's misplaced); this suggests wrong legend extraction (includes 4 from below?) or wrong picture range—unknown why, but likely legend_above logic fails as above_colors (rows0-4) has 1,2,3,4 but below has more, flipping sides incorrectly.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly fills upper areas with 1's and misplaces 2's/3's (e.g., row2 col14-23 has 1's but expected 2's; row8 col26-27 has 2's but expected 3's); picture filling leaks into legend or wrong sep_index (likely vertical, but left/right mischosen); component_id cycling starts wrong, overwriting pre-colors subtly.
 * extract_legend_colors (implicit in code) is helpful but broken here—adds colors from wrong side, including duplicates or post-sep leaks.
 * separation_score is helpful and core, but k=100 too aggressive, causing negative scores or wrong best_r/c in unbalanced grids.
 * self_fill is helpful and correct for connectivity, but applied to wrong regions (e.g., fills 5's in legend side accidentally).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but visited matrix init/clear per run could be optimized; no broken types.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills many 5's with 1's (e.g., scattered in cols24-29 across rows0-29, forming vertical strips), but leaves most 5's unfilled or untouched (e.g., large 5-clusters in rows8-16 cols0-23 remain 5's? Wait, output shows some 5's replaced but inconsistently—e.g., row8 col9-12 filled to 5? No, output has 5's persisting in picture areas like row10 col14-18, suggesting incomplete filling or wrong picture side.
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulating): Input has pre-colors (1's in col9-11, 8's in left, 6's/4's right/bottom) and 5's scattered; expected should extract legend colors (likely 1,4,6,8 from one side, say left/top), then fill right/bottom 5-components cycling e.g., [1,4,6,8]—but generated over-relies on 1 (only cycles to it?), ignores 8/6/4 in filling, and fills vertically (suggests vertical sep chosen wrong, legend_left=true but left has few colors vs. right 5's); e.g., row2 col14-18 should be one component filled uniform color, but output has mixed/unfilled; bottom row28 has 5's unfilled where expected full color blobs. This mismatches as it doesn't cycle properly and likely picks wrong sep (vertical at low c, making left legend but left has 1's and 5's penalized heavily).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid that represents a visual diagram with a legend of colored shapes (non-zero numbers excluding 5's and possibly background 1's), a separator line (full row or column of 1's dividing legend from picture), and a picture area containing blanks (5's) to be filled. The goal is to fill the 5's in the picture area by assigning colors from the legend's unique shapes/components in a specific order (likely discovery or positional), while preserving the original legend and separator, but the current program incorrectly cycles through legend colors for each connected component of 5's without matching shapes or sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 0 for empty/background, 1 for separators or background components (largest 1-component should be excluded from legend to avoid including the separator itself), 5 for blanks to fill in the picture area, and other numbers (2-8+) for pre-colored shapes in the legend.
 * Separators are full rows ('h') or columns ('v') entirely of 1's; if vertical, determine picture side by comparing number of 5's on left vs. right (picture on side with more or equal 5's).
 * Legend colors are derived from unique colors of connected components (4-directional adjacency, excluding 0,1,5) in discovery order (row-major), skipping the largest 1-component (likely the separator or background).
 * Filling only occurs in the "picture" region (post-separator, respecting side for vertical); non-picture 5's (if any) should remain 5 or be unchanged, but current code assumes all 5's are in picture.
 * Connected components of 5's in the picture should be filled entirely with one color, but assignment must match legend shapes by size/order/position, not just cycle through colors—cycling leads to mismatches where small/large 5-regions get wrong colors.
 * Preserve all original non-5 cells (including legend shapes and separator); output is a copy of input with only picture 5's replaced.
 * Subtle: Components ignore 5's during legend extraction (treat as barriers/non-part), so legend is purely from solid shapes; discovery order matters for legend sequence (sort by label after flood-fill labeling).
 * No separator case: Treat entire grid as picture, fill all 5-components.
 * Edge cases: Uneven number of 5-components vs. legend colors (don't cycle; perhaps repeat or match explicitly); multiple separators (code assumes one); 5's adjacent to legend but not crossing separator.
 * Picture determination for vertical: Use count of 5's to decide left/right, but if equal, current code picks left—may need tiebreaker (e.g., first non-empty).
 * Flood-fill for 5's must respect picture boundaries (in_picture_func) to avoid spilling into legend.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_separator(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    n = len(g)
    # Check for horizontal separator
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for c in range(n)):
            return 'h', r
    # Check for vertical separator
    for c in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)):
            return 'v', c
    return None, -1
```
(This correctly identifies the single separator row/column of 1's; useful for dividing legend vs. picture.)

```python
def get_picture_left(v_sep_index: int, g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    num_left = sum(1 for r in range(n) for c in range(v_sep_index) if g[r][c] == 5)
    num_right = sum(1 for r in range(n) for c in range(v_sep_index + 1, n) if g[r][c] == 5)
    return num_left >= num_right
```
(This decides picture side for vertical separators by 5-count; correct but may need refinement for ties.)

```python
def find_pre_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    n = len(g)
    label = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    next_label = 1
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if label[i][j] == 0 and g[i][j] != 0 and g[i][j] != 5:
                color = g[i][j]
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                size = 1
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and label[nx][ny] == 0 and g[nx][ny] != 0 and g[nx][ny] != 5:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            size += 1
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, color, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components
```
(This correctly labels and extracts connected components for legend, excluding 0/1/5; size tracking is useful for potential shape matching; 4-dir adjacency is standard.)

```python
def get_legend_colors(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not components:
        return []
    # Find largest color 1 component to exclude
    max_size = 0
    excluded_label = -1
    for lid, col, sz in components:
        if col == 1 and sz > max_size:
            max_size = sz
            excluded_label = lid
    # Build unique colors in discovery order, skipping excluded
    color_set = set()
    legend = []
    # Sort by label to ensure discovery order
    components.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    for lid, col, sz in components:
        if lid != excluded_label and col not in color_set:
            color_set.add(col)
            legend.append(col)
    return legend
```
(This builds legend by unique colors in order, excluding largest 1-component; helpful but may need to include sizes for matching instead of just colors.)

```python
def flood_fill_region(output: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int, in_picture: callable):
    n = len(g)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    stack = [(sr, sc)]
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    output[sr][sc] = color
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny] and in_picture(nx, ny):
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                output[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```
(This correctly flood-fills connected 5's with a single color, respecting picture boundaries; iterative stack avoids recursion depth issues.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies separators (both train examples preserve the row of 1's at row 5 unchanged).
 * Component extraction works: Legend colors are built in discovery order excluding largest 1 (e.g., train1 legend likely [2,3,4] or similar, applied to picture).
 * Picture side detection works for vertical (though not used in trains, which seem horizontal).
 * Flood-fill only targets picture 5's and preserves non-5's (upper legend and separator unchanged in both trains).
 * Missed shape/size matching: Fills each 5-component with next legend color via cycling (component_id % num_colors), but expected assigns specific colors to match legend shapes (e.g., train1 generated uses 2 in row13 col12-13 where expected has 4; generated row15 has 2's where expected has 4's in a larger blob).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated fills lower-left legend area incorrectly (e.g., row12 col8-9: 4,4 same as expected, but row13 col12-13: 2,2 vs expected 4,4; row14 col9-13:4's vs expected 4's but shifted; row16 col5:3 vs expected 3 same, but row20 col13-16:2's vs expected nothing/0? Wait, actually row20 generated has 2's in col12-15 where expected has nothing, indicating overfill outside picture). Overall, ~20-30% of picture cells wrong colors/sizes.
 * Train2 mismatches: Similar over-cycling; generated row11 col4:2 vs expected nothing (overfill?); row14 col2-8:2's vs expected 2's but wrong position; row20 col11-14:2's vs expected 3's in different area; row23 col4:3 vs expected nothing. Picture blobs get wrong colors (e.g., large bottom 3-blob partially 2 in generated).
 * Function `program` orchestrates well but assignment logic (cycling without matching) is broken—not helpful for core filling; replace with size/order matching.
 * No horizontal/vertical traversal order for 5-discovery affects component_id, leading to wrong sequence (e.g., train1 starts filling from bottom-left 5's, assigning early colors to wrong blobs).
 * Excludes all 1's except via largest, but small 1-blobs might be valid legend if not separator (subtle miss).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to fill some 5's but leaves many as-is or uses wrong colors, and includes fills outside expected picture (e.g., row1 col2-3:6,6 unchanged but surrounded by 0's; row2 col9-11:8,8,8 but test has complex 6/8/4 shapes suggesting legend on left/bottom, picture on right/top?).
 * Fills seem to cycle 1,8,6,4 but mismatch expected replication: e.g., row3 col14-18:4's correct for a horizontal bar, but row4 col13-14,18:4's sparse vs legend's solid 4-blob (row8-9 col0-1:4's small); large 8-blob in row20-29 col9+ gets 8 but interspersed with 0's/6's where should be solid.
 * Overfills non-picture: e.g., row7 col9-11:6,6,6 but if vertical separator at col12 (all 1's? input not shown, but output suggests no clear sep handling); row16 col14-17:8's but may be legend area.
 * Missing full replication: Legend seems to have 6-blob (row2-7 col1-7), 4-blob (row8 col0-1, row18-20 col1-3?), 8-blob (scattered), but picture (right side?) has partial matches only; many 5's (implied in input) remain unfilled or wrong (e.g., row22 col5-9:8's but jagged vs smooth legend).
 * To handle test: Need explicit shape matching (e.g., sort 5-components and legend by size/position, assign matching color); current cycling assigns 1 to thin verticals (row0-29 col24:1's) which may be wrong if 1 is background.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where connected components of placeholder pixels (value 5) represent shapes that must be replaced with digits (1-4) based on the number of internal holes they enclose, using a key derived from patterns in rows 1-3 of the grid. The goal is to identify these components, count their enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the exterior background), map hole counts to digits via the key, fill the component and its holes with the mapped digit, and set unmapped components to 0, while preserving other grid elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grid is fixed at 30x30 (H=30, W=30); assume input g is this size, with 0 as background/empty, 5 as placeholders for shapes, and digits 1-4 already placed or to be placed.
 * Shapes are 4-connected components of 5's (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Holes are internal 0-components not reachable from the grid borders (exterior flood-fill from borders marks background 0's); only count hole components adjacent to exactly one shape component (via 4-directions) to avoid shared holes between shapes.
 * Key extraction from rows 1-3: Look for horizontal runs of the same non-0/5 digit in row 1 (length >=3), check if row 3 matches exactly, then count 0's in the corresponding segment of row 2 to get hole_count -> digit mapping (e.g., 0 zeros might map to solid digit, 1 zero to digit with one hole).
 * Replacement: For each shape component, use its hole count to look up the digit in the mapping; if found, replace all 5's in the component and all pixels in its associated hole(s) with the digit; if not found, set the 5's to 0 (but do not touch holes).
 * Subtleties: Mapping is built only from valid key segments (matching rows 1/3, length >=3); multiple keys possible, but assume unique hole counts. Holes must be fully enclosed (no border connection). Adjacency for hole-to-shape is 4-directional and checks comp_id. Preserve existing digits (1-4) and background 0's outside shapes/holes. Components with 0 holes or multiple adjacent holes might default to 0 or need special handling. The key might not cover all hole counts, leading to defaults. In trains, shapes have irregular forms (e.g., not fully filled), so replacement must fill exactly the 5's and holes, not expand. Exterior flood must handle all border 0's, including corners, to correctly identify internals.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly identifies 5-components, marks exterior 0's, finds internal holes, assigns them to single-adjacent shapes, builds a row 1-3 mapping based on 0-counts in row 2, and replaces 5's + holes with mapped digit (or 0 if unmapped).
 * What worked: Component finding via BFS accurately groups 5's; exterior flood-fill correctly identifies background 0's (no leaks in trains); hole finding and single-adjacency check is logically sound; mapping extraction skips short/non-matching segments and uses exact 0-counts.
 * What didn't work: In train 1, generated mismatches expected in multiple shapes—e.g., row 10: generated [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,...] (3's not fully filled, missing hole at col 4); row 11: generated solid 4's vs expected with holes; row 12: generated [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,...] vs expected with holes in 1's area; row 14: generated solid 4's/holes mismatch; lower 2's and 1's have wrong patterns (e.g., row 20: generated solid 3's vs expected with holes; row 21: generated [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,...] but later rows show 2's/1's with incorrect hole placements like solid vs dotted). Reason unknown, but likely overcounting holes or wrong adjacency (e.g., shared/multi-adj holes not handled, or mapping misapplied to wrong count). Train 1 also leaves some 5's as 0 implicitly but shapes are incomplete.
 * In train 2, generated mismatches: row 10: generated [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...] but later rows show 3's with wrong fills (e.g., row 11: generated partial 2's vs expected with holes in 3's; row 15: generated 2's block vs expected with holes; lower 3's in rows 23-27 have solid/missing holes, e.g., row 24: generated [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] but patterns don't match dotted expectations). Likely same issue: incorrect hole assignment or mapping (e.g., treating multi-hole or shared as single, or wrong num0 in key).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding (core component/hole logic), but fails to reproduce exact shapes, suggesting bugs in hole counting (e.g., counting size instead of components? Code counts components via +=1 per hole group, but trains suggest per-pixel or different metric) or adjacency (perhaps holes adjacent to multiple via indirect paths). No unhelpful functions; all provided (BFS, flood, mapping) are essential and mostly correct, but hole assignment may need refinement (e.g., ensure holes are fully enclosed by one shape only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed logic as trains, replacing presumed 5's with 8,6,4 in patterned blocks (e.g., rows 2-6 show 8's with hole-like 0's preserved? No, it fills some but leaves 0's in patterns matching input holes, but digits like 8/6/4 suggest wrong mapping—puzzle likely expects 1-4 only, not higher; right column has solid 1's preserved correctly, but upper 8's block (rows 2-6) has inconsistent fills (e.g., row 2: 8,8,8 at end but 0's elsewhere; row 3: dotted 8's), lower 6's (rows 8-16) are dotted but overfilled in places, and bottom 4's (rows 18-28) similarly dotted but not matching typical 1-4 hole patterns from trains. It mismatches expected puzzle output by using invalid digits (8,6,4 instead of mapping to 1-4) and incomplete fills (e.g., not closing holes properly in 8's/6's/4's blocks), likely due to same hole-counting error—mentally, test input seems to have key in top (implied rows 1-3 with patterns for 1-4), and shapes with 0/1/2 holes, so output should replace with 1-4 in exact input shapes + filled holes, but generated leaves dotted 0's and uses wrong values, indicating mapping failure or misidentification of 5's (test shows 8/6/4/1 already? Wait, input has 8/6/4 as existing? No, generated is post-process, but trains suggest 5's become 1-4; here it seems to treat existing digits as 5's wrongly or mapping pulls wrong values).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a 30x30 grid where connected components of colored pixels (1-4) act as "keys" that encode a mapping based on the number of enclosed zero-spaces (holes) they surround, and components of 5's (placeholders) must be transformed by replacing them with the color from the matching key based on their own hole count. The goal is to correctly identify and map these keys, then apply the transformation to all 5-components without altering other parts of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys are connected components (flood-fill 4-directional adjacency) of the same non-zero, non-5 color; only certain components qualify as keys (in this attempt, those spanning exactly 3 rows vertically, which may be too restrictive and miss horizontal or irregular shapes).
 * The "h" value (hole count) for a component is the number of 0-cells fully enclosed by it (all 4 orthogonal neighbors must be part of the component), but this may overcount or miscount if holes are not fully internal or if boundary conditions are mishandled; subtle issue: enclosure check assumes a closed loop, but may fail for open or partial surrounds.
 * Mapping is from h to the component's color C, but assumes unique h per key; if multiple keys have the same h, it overwrites (last one wins), which could cause errors if duplicates exist.
 * 5-components are transformed uniformly to the mapped color if h matches a key; if no match, defaults to 0 (erasing them), which is likely wrong—expected outputs show 5's becoming specific colors like 1,2,3,4 without erasure.
 * Grid is mostly empty (0's), with patterns resembling letters/numbers (e.g., vertical bars, E-shapes); keys are likely the small, structured patterns (e.g., height-3 verticals in training), while 5's mimic those shapes but need recoloring.
 * Subtle: Components must be exactly connected same-value cells; diagonals don't count. Also, keys exclude 5's and 0's; processing order (keys first, then 5's) is correct but visited tracking prevents reprocessing.
 * Easy to miss: Height check (maxr - minr +1 ==3) works for training vertical keys but fails if keys are wider/shorter; h computation iterates all 0's globally, which is inefficient but correct in principle, but may count holes outside the component if neighbors overlap multiple components.
 * All non-key components (e.g., large blobs) are left unchanged; output is a copy of input with only 5's modified.
 * Considerations from attempts: Flood-fill must handle stack-based DFS correctly to avoid stack overflow on large components (N=30 is small, so fine); h=0 for no holes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    N = 30
    C = g[start_r][start_c]
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(start_r, start_c)]
    component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    visited[start_r][start_c] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == C:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood_fill is correct and essential for extracting connected components of same color; uses DFS stack, marks visited to avoid overlap.)

```python
def compute_h(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    N = 30
    comp_set = set(component)
    h = 0
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if g[i][j] == 0:
                neigh_pos = [(i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in dirs]
                if all(0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and (ni, nj) in comp_set for ni, nj in neigh_pos):
                    h += 1
    return h
```
(This computes enclosed holes by checking if every 0 has all 4 neighbors in the component; helpful but potentially flawed for non-simply-connected shapes—counts any fully surrounded 0, even if not "inside" the intended hole; use set for fast lookup.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies vertical height-3 components as keys and computes h as enclosed 0's, but the height restriction misses non-vertical keys (e.g., in training 1 expected, some 3's and 1's are horizontal or irregular).
 * Mapping works partially (e.g., transforms some 5's to correct colors like 2's in top of training 1), but overwrites or misses due to h mismatches—e.g., in training 1, generated keeps 4's where expected has 3's in rows 9-11 cols 3-5, and places 4's instead of 1's in rows 11-12 cols 20-25.
 * In training 1, generated has 4's in a scattered pattern (e.g., row 9 col 9-11, row 10 col 2-3,8-11) where expected has 3's there and shifts 1's/4's elsewhere; unknown why h computation mismatches, possibly because enclosure check counts global 0's incorrectly for those components.
 * In training 2, generated places 2's in large blobs (e.g., rows 14-16 cols 12-29) where expected has 3's, and misses 3's in bottom (e.g., row 9 col 26-27 generated 2's, expected 3's); also generates extra 2's in row 8 cols 24-25 where expected 0's.
 * transform_fives correctly applies mapping to 5-components via flood-fill, but defaults to 0 on no match, which erases some 5's incorrectly (e.g., training 1 row 17 has generated 0's where expected 1's/3's).
 * identify_keys skips components without height==3, causing misses (e.g., training 2 has wider 3-key at bottom, not detected).
 * Overall, h computation seems to work for simple vertical keys (e.g., top 1,2,3,4 in training 1 match), but fails for complex shapes; no unhelpful functions—all are relevant, but height filter is broken for generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places vertical columns of 1's (e.g., col 24 rows 0-29) where input likely has empty or other patterns, suggesting over-transformation or misdetection of keys as 1's.
 * Patterns of 8,6,4 appear in blocks (e.g., rows 1-6 cols 26-28 as 8's with gaps mimicking E-shape, rows 7-16 cols 26-28 as 6's, rows 17-28 cols 26-28 as 4's), which seem to directly copy input 5-shapes but recolor them sequentially (8→6→4), but this doesn't match training logic—likely wrong because training expected specific recolors (1-4) based on holes, not arbitrary 4/6/8; 8 and 6 aren't in expected colors (only 1-4), so mapping is inventing invalid colors.
 * Missing transformations: Input test (inferred from output) has repeated vertical E-like 5's, but output doesn't match hole-based logic (e.g., all get different colors without clear h-variation); erases some to 0's incorrectly, similar to training defaults.
 * Does not make sense: If keys have h mapping to 1-4, output shouldn't produce 6/8; likely h miscomputed for test keys, or no keys detected, falling back to wrong defaults—needs better key identification beyond height=3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided into a legend section (showing colored shapes with specific hole counts) and a picture section (with unshaded areas marked as 5's), separated by a full line of 1's (horizontal or vertical). The goal is to replace the 5's in the picture with colors from the legend by matching the number of enclosed holes (0's) in connected components of the same color/size >=5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator is a complete row or column of all 1's; if horizontal, legend is above and picture below; if vertical, determine legend vs. picture by checking which side has no 5's (legend side) or by hole-based mapping logic.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-zero/non-1/non-5 value, with size at least 5 cells; ignore isolated cells or small groups.
 * Holes are fully enclosed 0's within the bounding box of a component; the hole-counting flood-fill starts from boundaries but must correctly identify interior disconnected 0-regions as separate holes—current implementation mixes boundary seeding with interior counting, leading to under/over-counting.
 * Mapping is from hole count in legend components to their color value; if no match, leave as 5 or default; picture components of 5's get their holes computed and filled with matching legend color.
 * Subtleties: Vertical separators require swapping legend/picture if the right side has no 5's (indicating picture on left); bounding boxes for holes must be tight (min/max row/col of component) but flood-fill only within that box; 0's on boundaries aren't holes; components can't span the separator; the grid may have empty rows/columns of 0's as padding.
 * Easy to miss: Legend components can have 0 holes; multiple components can map to same hole count (use last or first?); picture 5-components may touch edges or be irregular; 1's in legend/picture are barriers, not fillable; output copies input but only replaces 5's in picture.
 * All 0's, 1's, and non-picture areas remain unchanged; only picture 5's are replaced.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core structure works: correctly identifies horizontal separator in training 1 (row 5 all 1's), vertical in training 2; finds legend components (e.g., 2,3,4 in train1 legend) and picture 5's.
 * Hole mapping partially works: in train1, some 0-hole shapes (like solid 4's) map correctly, but fails to fill certain 5-components with 1's or 2's (e.g., row 11-16 in picture keeps 5's instead of filling with 1's based on 1-hole match).
 * Component finding works for large groups but skips small ones correctly; area separation works for horizontal but vertical logic in train2 misassigns sides, leading to wrong legend (fills picture with wrong colors like keeping 5's in rows 2-6 cols 14+).
 * Hole computation is broken: undercounts or miscounts enclosures (e.g., in train1, a 5-component with 1 hole gets mapped wrong, filling with 5 instead of 1; unknown why boundary seeding floods interiors incorrectly); doesn't handle touching-edge holes or irregular shapes well.
 * Output copies grid correctly but only replaces some 5's, leaving others (e.g., train1 row12 col21-25 stays 5 instead of 1); no handling for multiple legend entries with same holes (overwrites mapping).
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in picture area—e.g., rows 11-16 cols 20+ have 5's where expected has 1's (a 1-hole shape unfilled); rows 19-25 cols 24+ have 5's instead of 1's/2's; legend unchanged correctly, but overall incomplete filling.
 * Train2: Mismatches in vertical setup—generated fills some 5's with 2's incorrectly (rows 2-6 cols 14-23 stay 5 or wrong), and picture areas like rows 9-29 cols 20+ keep 5's or fill wrong (e.g., expected 3's in rows 20-29 cols 20+ but generated has scattered 5's/3's); unknown why vertical side swap fails.
 * Function `compute_holes` is broken (incorrect flood-fill logic leads to wrong counts, e.g., counts boundary 0's as holes sometimes); not helpful as-is—needs fix for true enclosure detection.
 * `find_components_in_area` is helpful and correct for extracting blobs, essential for both legend and picture.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond `compute_holes`; overall program understands separation/mapping but fails on hole accuracy and vertical cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have identified a vertical separator (likely col 24 all 1's) and filled some 5's (e.g., rows 0-6 cols 0-8 with 8's, rows 8-16 cols 24-29 with 6's), but leaves many 5's unfilled (e.g., rows 17-29 cols 0-4 stay 5's, should be matched to legend colors like 4's based on holes) and introduces wrong fills (e.g., row 20 cols 10-19 has 4's but scattered, not matching expected solid shapes; row 8 col 0 has 5 where legend shouldn't have 5's).
 * Missing consistent hole-based filling: e.g., upper-left 5's (rows 0-1 cols 9-11) stay 5 or partial, but should map to a legend color (possibly 8 or other based on 0/1 holes); lower picture (rows 17+) has partial 4's but ignores enclosure matches, leaving holes unfilled.
 * Does not make sense overall—scattered numbers like 8's in legend area (rows 0-6 cols 2-7) suggest wrong area assignment or component bleed; expects cleaner replacement of all picture 5's with legend colors (e.g., 4,6 patterns matching hole counts from upper legend), but current has remnants and mismatches; account for potential multiple legends or edge-touching components to handle test.

**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where connected components of cells valued at 5 (likely representing uncolored "blobs" or regions) must be identified and recolored with integers 1-4 such that no two adjacent components (sharing an edge) receive the same color, following 4-connectivity rules; the rest of the grid (non-5 cells) remains unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid matching this coloring scheme, possibly with a preference for higher colors (e.g., starting assignments from 4 downward) to match specific expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and only cells with exactly 5 are considered for component extraction—other values like 0,1,2,3,4,6,8 must be preserved as-is in the output.
 * Adjacency for coloring is also 4-directional and only between different components (i.e., if two 5-cells from different components touch, their colors must differ; same-component cells get the same color).
 * Coloring is greedy but order-sensitive: the current implementation assigns colors starting from the highest (4 down to 1) based on forbidden colors from already-colored neighbors, but this order-of-discovery (row-major scanning) leads to mismatches—expected outputs suggest a need for a different traversal order, canonical labeling (e.g., by size, position, or min coordinates), or possibly a full graph coloring algorithm that minimizes colors or follows a specific priority.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous or nested/irregularly shaped, and small isolated components (size 1+) must be handled; the min_r/min_c in components tracking seems intended for sorting/ordering but isn't used effectively for coloring decisions.
 * Preserve all non-5 values exactly (e.g., input 1s stay 1, 8s stay 8); the output should never introduce values outside 1-4 for former 5s or alter existing numbers.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no 5s should return unchanged; large components spanning the grid; potential for 4+ colors needed but since graph is planar-ish, 4 should suffice.
 * The puzzle likely simulates "region coloring" like in maps or Nonogram-style puzzles, where visual separation (no same-color adjacencies) is key—mismatches often occur in complex interlocked regions where greedy fails to match expected "minimal" or "preferred" colorings.
 * Important: Labeling must be unique per component (next_label increments correctly), and adjacency building removes duplicates, but the coloring loop processes labels in discovery order (1 to num_labels), which may not align with expected color priorities (e.g., larger components or top-left first might need precedence).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for preserving the input grid while modifying only 5s.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]], List[List[int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return [], [[0]]
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    label = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    next_label = 1
    components = []
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 5 and label[i][j] == 0:
                size = 0
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                label[i][j] = next_label
                min_r, min_c = i, j
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    size += 1
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] == 5 and label[nx][ny] == 0:
                            label[nx][ny] = next_label
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((next_label, min_r, min_c, size))
                next_label += 1
    return components, label
```
(This BFS-based component finder with labeling and min position/size tracking is solid and correctly identifies 4-connected 5-components; it's essential for extraction and could be extended by sorting components e.g., by (min_r, min_c) for consistent ordering.)

```python
def build_adjacency(label: List[List[int]], num_labels: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(label), len(label[0])
    adj = [[] for _ in range(num_labels + 1)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if label[i][j] > 0:
                l = label[i][j]
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and label[ni][nj] > 0 and label[ni][nj] != l:
                        adj[l].append(label[ni][nj])
    for i in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        adj[i] = list(set(adj[i]))
    return adj
```
(This builds an undirected graph of component adjacencies correctly by scanning labeled grid edges and deduplicating neighbors; very helpful for modeling the coloring constraint graph.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt, which correctly implements connected component labeling via BFS and builds an adjacency graph, but fails in the greedy coloring step due to processing labels in discovery order (leading to suboptimal or mismatched color assignments compared to expected).
 * What worked: Component extraction accurately identifies and labels separate 5-regions (e.g., in training 1, the top 1/2/3/4 blobs are split correctly); adjacency detection catches edge-sharing between components; grid copying preserves non-5s.
 * What didn't work: The assign_colors function uses a simple greedy approach (highest available color 4-to-1) in label order, but expected outputs use different assignments—e.g., in training 1, generated uses all 4 for a large bottom-left blob where expected splits it into 3 and 1; in training 2, generated merges or miscolors a sprawling 2-region into 4s. This suggests the need to sort components (e.g., by size descending or position) before coloring, or use a different strategy like smallest degree last or exact matching to expected priorities.
 * In training 1: Generated mismatches in rows 9-29, e.g., row 9 has 4,4,4 where expected has 3,3,3; row 11 has 4s where expected has 1s; row 14 has scattered 4s/1s differently; unknown why, but likely due to coloring order causing a chain reaction in interlocked regions.
 * In training 2: Mismatches in rows 1-29, e.g., row 1 has 4,4 where expected has 2,2; row 8 has 4s where expected has 2s; row 9 has 2s where expected has 3s; again, greedy order fails on complex topologies.
 * The main program ties it together well but doesn't sort components or adjust coloring for expected patterns—min_r/min_c/size are computed but unused beyond appending.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (copy_grid, find_components, build_adjacency, assign_colors) are relevant, though assign_colors needs fixing (e.g., sort labels by component size or position before coloring loop).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it introduces or preserves values like 8 and 6 (e.g., in rows 1-6 and 7-16), which are likely from the input grid and unchanged (correct behavior), but the coloring of 5s results in 1 and 4 mostly, with patterns that seem arbitrary (e.g., a large 4-blob in rows 2-6 cols 1-8, isolated 1s in col 24); however, without the expected test output, it's hard to confirm, but it doesn't match the structured 1-4 colorings in training expecteds and includes 8/6 which may indicate the input has pre-colored elements that interact poorly.
 * Issues: Scattered 1s in col 24 across many rows suggest small components colored low, but expected might group them differently; the 4-heavy upper left doesn't align with training expecteds' balanced use of 1-3; potential over-reliance on discovery order causes inconsistent coloring (e.g., why col 26-28 get 8s—probably input, but if 5s there, coloring failed); overall, it looks like partial component detection but wrong color propagation, similar to training failures—does not make sense as a valid 4-coloring without verifying adjacencies mentally (e.g., adjacent 4s from different components would violate rules).
 * To handle test: Ensure coloring accounts for pre-existing colors? No, program ignores them for forbidden sets, which might be wrong if puzzle treats all non-0 as "colored" already; also, sort components by (min_r, min_c) or size to match expected order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where a legend of colored shapes (non-orange, spanning specific rows) with varying hole counts defines a mapping from hole numbers to colors, which is then used to recolor orange (5) shapes elsewhere in the grid based on their own hole counts (replacing with the mapped color or 0 if unmapped); the goal is to transform the entire grid accordingly while preserving non-relevant elements like dividers or backgrounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legend components must be non-5 colors and exactly span rows 1-3 (0-indexed), identified sequentially by hole count h matching their left-to-right position (expected_h starting at 0 and incrementing only on match; stop building on mismatch to handle incomplete/invalid legends).
 * Holes are 4-connected components of 0-cells fully enclosed within a shape's bounding box (min_r to max_r, min_c to max_c), specifically those not reachable via flood-fill from the bounding box's boundary 0-cells (background 0's are boundary-connected, holes are the remaining disconnected 0-CCs inside).
 * Orange (5) shapes are transformed component-by-component: compute their hole count h using the same bounding-box enclosure logic, then replace all cells in the component with legend[h] if it exists, else 0 (effectively removing unmapped shapes).
 * Grid is square (n x n), backgrounds are 0, shapes are solid connected components of the same non-0 color (4-connected adjacency).
 * Subtlety: Hole computation is local to each shape's bounding box to isolate internal enclosures, ignoring global connectivity or outside 0's; this prevents overcounting or undercounting due to adjacent shapes or grid edges.
 * Dividers (e.g., vertical bars of 1's) are not transformed and should remain as-is, as they are likely non-legend, non-orange components.
 * Legend building stops on mismatch to avoid incorrect mappings if the puzzle has validation (e.g., if a shape in position doesn't have the expected holes, don't use later ones).
 * Only transform orange components; other colors (including legend shapes) stay unchanged.
 * Edge case: Empty components or no holes yield 0; legend may be incomplete, leading to some oranges becoming 0.
 * Visually, shapes like letters (e.g., 'B' with 2 holes, 'A' with 1) are common, so hole counting must handle multi-hole enclosures correctly via separate CCs in remaining 0's.
 * Bounding box includes only the shape's extent, but hole flood-fill is constrained to it to define "enclosed."

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood_fill_to_find_component(grid: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], sr: int, sc: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

    pass  # Full code in attempt; handles empty comp as 0

    """

    """

    Core transformation step.
    """
    # (Implementation as in provided: copies grid, uses new_grid for replacement to avoid interfering with flood-fill)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of legend extraction, hole counting via bbox isolation, and orange transformation.
 * What worked: Accurate component detection with flood-fill; correct bbox-based hole logic that distinguishes enclosed vs. boundary 0's; sequential legend building with mismatch stopping; in-place transformation on a grid copy to preserve structure.
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test fully correct (see below), but no explicit failures noted; potential subtlety missed if legend shapes have internal structure affecting bbox (e.g., if they don't perfectly span cols, but code doesn't check col span).
 * Function `compute_min_max_r` is helpful but limited (only rows; cols computed inline elsewhere—could consolidate to full bbox util).
 * All provided functions (flood_fill, compute_holes, etc.) are relevant and working for the puzzle; no unhelpful or broken ones identified here, though future attempts should validate against edge cases like touching shapes or irregular bboxes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output appears mostly correct and makes sense based on puzzle rules: it shows a 30x30 grid with a vertical divider of 1's in column 24 (unchanged, as expected for non-orange/non-legend); transformed shapes of 8's (rows ~1-5, likely 2-hole 'B'-like, mapped from legend), 6's (rows ~7-16, possibly 1-hole or 0-hole patterns), and 4's (rows ~17-28, similar); gaps (all 0's) between sections preserved; top/bottom rows fully 0 except divider.
 * Observed effects: Patterns like [1,0,8,8,8,0] repeating suggest letter-like shapes with holes replaced correctly (e.g., 8's have internal 0's not transformed); no 5's remain, indicating all oranges processed; legend likely built from top (rows 1-3) with h=0,1,2,... mapping to 4,6,8 or similar.
 * Differences from expected: Hard to confirm without input grid, but output lacks any 5's or unmapped remnants (good); however, the 8/6/4 patterns repeat vertically more than typical (e.g., 8's in 3-row blocks x2 with gaps?), which might indicate over-transformation or legend misread if input had stacked oranges—possibly correct if input had multi-component oranges, but could be incorrect if legend h didn't match (e.g., if a shape has 3 holes but legend only to 2, should be 0 not 4/6/8). The long vertical spans for 6's/4's (8+ rows) suggest either tall shapes or multiple adjacent components merged incorrectly, differing from compact legend expectation—may need tighter component validation. Overall, it aligns with rules but feels elongated; unsure if exact match without input, but no obvious errors like leftover 5's or wrong colors.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interactions and Connections

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (Train 1 and Train 2), the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across both examples. These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect each other in every case, without speculation or forcing non-evident links. Only orange shapes show transformations; other elements (e.g., non-orange shapes) remain static. No position-based movement or transformation is observed (bounding boxes and pixel counts are preserved where applicable). Interactions involving test inputs cannot be verified for consistency without outputs, so they are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact visual grid layout or why specific examples appear in top rows) are noted as such but not explained.

1. **Hole count of orange shapes interacts with hole counts of example shapes to determine color transformation**:
   - Example shapes (non-orange, typically small and positioned in initial/top rows with distinct hole counts: e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3 in Train 1; 0, 1 in Train 2) provide a mapping of hole count to color.
   - If an orange shape's hole count exactly matches an example shape's hole count, the orange shape's color changes to the matching example's color.
   - This is consistent: In Train 1, orange holes=0 → yellow (matching example yellow holes=0); holes=1 → green; holes=2 → blue; holes=3 → red. In Train 2, orange holes=0 → red (matching example red holes=0); holes=1 → green.
   - No interaction if no matching example hole count (see omission below).

2. **Hole count of orange shapes interacts with example shapes to adjust output holes**:
   - Upon color transformation (per above), the orange shape's holes are set to the value of the matching example's holes (which equals the original hole count in observed cases).
   - This is consistent: Transformed shapes in both trains output with holes equal to their input holes (e.g., orange holes=2 → blue holes=2 in Train 1; orange holes=1 → green holes=1 in Train 2).
   - Effect is deterministic and tied to the color mapping interaction.

3. **Unmatched hole count in orange shapes leads to omission (no transformation or inclusion in output)**:
   - Orange shapes whose hole count has no matching example are entirely omitted from the output (no color change, no position preservation).
   - This is consistent: In Train 1, orange holes=4 omitted (no example for 4). In Train 2, orange holes=2 omitted (no example for 2). Bounding box and pixels are not preserved because the shape is removed.
   - Unknown: Why higher hole counts (e.g., 4 or 5 in tests) might interact differently if examples were provided, but no evidence in trains.

4. **Color and holes of non-orange shapes have no interaction (remain unchanged)**:
   - Non-orange shapes (e.g., initial yellow/green/blue/red in Train 1; red/green/blue in Train 2) retain their exact color, holes, bounding box, and pixels in the output.
   - This is consistent across both trains: No transformations observed, regardless of position or hole count. They serve as static "examples" but do not affect each other or undergo changes.
   - No connection to orange shapes beyond providing the mapping in interaction 1.

5. **Bounding box (position) of transformed orange shapes is preserved from input to output**:
   - For orange shapes that undergo color/holes transformation (per 1-2), the bounding box remains identical.
   - This is consistent: E.g., in Train 1, orange [17,11,25,16] → blue [17,11,25,16]; in Train 2, orange [19,8,28,15] → green [19,8,28,15].
   - No effect on transformation (position does not cause or alter color/holes changes); it is passively preserved. Omitted shapes (per 3) lose this preservation.

6. **Pixel count of transformed orange shapes is preserved from input to output**:
   - Similar to bounding box: For transformed oranges, pixels remain unchanged.
   - This is consistent: E.g., in Train 1, orange pixels=31 → blue pixels=31; in Train 2, orange pixels=46 → green pixels=46.
   - No causal effect (pixels do not influence color/holes or vice versa); purely static preservation. Omitted shapes lose this.

### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded per Instructions)
- No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., no evidence of one color affecting another's transformation across both trains).
- No position-to-transformation effects (e.g., bbox coordinates do not alter color, holes, or inclusion; only preserved passively).
- No shape silhouette/edge/hole count interactions beyond the color mapping for oranges (e.g., no consistent "nesting" or void effects on movement).
- No background/border or vertical strip interactions (mentioned in description but not evident in data lists; inconsistent or irrelevant).
- Elements like the blue line/shape ([0,5,29,5] in Train 1; [0,0,9,6] or [5,0,5,29] in Train 2) are non-orange and unchanged, with no observed connections to others.
- Higher hole counts (e.g., 4+ in tests) or non-standard colors (e.g., maroon, pink) show no interactions in trains, so unknown if they follow the same mapping.
- No total solution or high-level rule inferred; only pairwise property effects listed.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 20:51:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where colored regions (colors >=2, excluding 5) in a legend area encode a mapping from the number of enclosed holes (isolated 0-regions within a shape's bounding box) to specific colors. Regions marked with 5 are unknowns that must be filled with the color corresponding to their computed hole count from the legend mapping, or left as 0 if no match exists.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legend components are connected components (4-directional) of the same color (>=2 and !=5) that must be 2D (bounding box height >1 and width >1); 1D lines or single cells are ignored as they don't form valid legend entries.
 * Holes are counted as the number of separate connected components (CCs) of 0s fully enclosed within a component's bounding box (bbox); to identify them, flood-fill from all 0s on the bbox boundary (top/bottom rows, left/right columns) to mark background 0s connected to the edge, then count any remaining unvisited 0 CCs inside the bbox as true holes— this prevents counting edge-connected 0s as holes.
 * The mapping is from hole count to color, assuming one legend entry per hole count (no duplicates); if multiple legend entries have the same hole count, the program overwrites with the last one, which could be a bug if the puzzle guarantees uniqueness.
 * For 5-regions, treat them identically: compute their enclosed hole count using the same bbox-based method, look up in the hole-to-color map, and fill the entire connected 5-component with the matched color or 0 if unmatched—do not leave as 5.
 * Background 0s outside components are irrelevant; the flood-fill for holes is strictly bounded to the component's bbox to avoid global background interference, but ensure bbox calculations are tight (min/max row/col of the component).
 * Subtlety: 0s inside the bbox but connected diagonally don't count as separate if using 4-connectivity (as in the code); puzzle likely uses 4-connectivity for consistency with component finding.
 * Edge cases: Components touching grid edges may have bbox boundaries partially outside, but code clamps to [0,n-1]; single-cell or degenerate components (height=1 or width=1) have 0 holes by design.
 * The legend is typically in the top or scattered, but code scans whole grid; 5s can be anywhere and may interleave with legend.
 * If a 5-component's bbox includes parts of other colors, hole counting only considers 0s, ignoring intrusions— this could lead to incorrect hole counts if 5s are not solid.
 * Code assumes colors are integers 0-9ish, but test has 8/6/4/1, so generalization is needed beyond 1-4.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies legend components and computes hole counts using bbox-bounded flooding, which worked for training example 2 (full correct output, implying proper mapping and filling for that case).
 * Failed training example 1: Generated output leaves a central 5-region (around rows 12-16, cols 19-25) unfilled or as 0s instead of filling with 1 (as in expected); also places extraneous 1s in row 12 cols 20-23 and other mismatches like missing 1s in rows 17-25 cols 19-28—likely due to incorrect hole count for that 5-component (possibly overcounting background or bbox miscalculation including adjacent non-0s).
 * In train1 generated vs expected: Row 12 has generated [...,4,4,0,0,...] but expected [...,1,1,1,1,...] at cols 20+; row 13 generated has 1s only at end but expected more structured 1s; row 20 generated misses 1s at cols 24-28 where expected has them; overall, ~20-30% mismatch in 1-filled areas, suggesting the 5-component's holes weren't detected as matching the legend's 1-hole entry.
 * The build_hole_to_color function is helpful but may overwrite maps if duplicate hole counts (not seen in samples); process_five_components correctly iterates 5-CCs but falls back to 0 on no match, which is right but failed in train1.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (flood_fill, find_legend_components, compute_enclosed_holes, build_hole_to_color, process_five_components) are relevant and core to the logic; none are broken per se, but compute_enclosed_holes may have a subtle bug in boundary seeding or flooding constraints for complex interleaved 5s (e.g., if 5s touch legend or have internal non-0 intrusions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears plausible and likely correct: It shows filled regions with colors 1 (thin vertical strip on right, possibly a 0-hole or simple shape), 4 (bottom clustered with holes), 6 (mid-right with apparent enclosures), and 8 (top-left complex shape with internal 0s suggesting multiple holes)—no 5s remain, indicating successful filling based on hole counts.
 * Makes sense as it preserves non-5 colors (e.g., 8/6/4 shapes intact) and adds 1s where 5s were likely present; structures like the 8-shape (rows 2-7, cols 1-8 with internal 0s) suggest 2-3 holes matching a legend entry, and output doesn't alter them incorrectly.
 * No obvious errors: Hole-based filling would explain the 1-strip (simple no-hole 5s) and integrated 4/6 areas without leaving 0s in enclosed spots; since train2 passed, this likely handles higher colors (8/6) correctly via >=2 !=5 filter.
